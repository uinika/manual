       <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), and <b>mlockall</b>() lock part or all of the calling
       process's virtual address space into RAM, preventing that memory from
       being paged to the swap area.

       <b>munlock</b>() and <b>munlockall</b>() perform the converse operation, unlocking
       part or all of the calling process's virtual address space, so that
       pages in the specified virtual address range may once more to be
       swapped out if required by the kernel memory manager.

       Memory locking and unlocking are performed in units of whole pages.

   <b>mlock(), mlock2(), and munlock()</b>
       <b>mlock</b>() locks pages in the address range starting at <i>addr</i> and
       continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.  All pages that contain a part of the
       specified address range are guaranteed to be resident in RAM when the
       call returns successfully; the pages are guaranteed to stay in RAM
       until later unlocked.

       <b>mlock2</b>() also locks pages in the specified range starting at <i>addr</i> and
       continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.  However, the state of the pages contained
       in that range after the call returns successfully will depend on the
       value in the <i>flags</i> argument.

       The <i>flags</i> argument can be either 0 or the following constant:

       <b>MLOCK_ONFAULT</b>
              Lock pages that are currently resident and mark the entire
              range to have pages locked when they are populated by the page
              fault.

       If <i>flags</i> is 0, <b>mlock2</b>() behaves exactly the same as <b>mlock</b>().

       Note: currently, there is not a glibc wrapper for <b>mlock2</b>(), so it
       will need to be invoked using <a href="syscall.2.html">syscall(2)</a>.

       <b>munlock</b>() unlocks pages in the address range starting at <i>addr</i> and
       continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.  After this call, all pages that contain a
       part of the specified memory range can be moved to external swap
       space again by the kernel.

   <b>mlockall() and munlockall()</b>
       <b>mlockall</b>() locks all pages mapped into the address space of the
       calling process.  This includes the pages of the code, data and stack
       segment, as well as shared libraries, user space kernel data, shared
       memory, and memory-mapped files.  All mapped pages are guaranteed to
       be resident in RAM when the call returns successfully; the pages are
       guaranteed to stay in RAM until later unlocked.

       The <i>flags</i> argument is constructed as the bitwise OR of one or more of
       the following constants:

       <b>MCL_CURRENT </b>Lock all pages which are currently mapped into the
                   address space of the process.

       <b>MCL_FUTURE  </b>Lock all pages which will become mapped into the address
                   space of the process in the future.  These could be, for
                   instance, new pages required by a growing heap and stack
                   as well as new memory-mapped files or shared memory
                   regions.

       <b>MCL_ONFAULT </b>(since Linux 4.4)
                   Used together with <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>, <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>, or both.
                   Mark all current (with <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>) or future (with
                   <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>) mappings to lock pages when they are faulted
                   in.  When used with <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>, all present pages are
                   locked, but <b>mlockall</b>() will not fault in non-present
                   pages.  When used with <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>, all future mappings
                   will be marked to lock pages when they are faulted in,
                   but they will not be populated by the lock when the
                   mapping is created.  <b>MCL_ONFAULT </b>must be used with either
                   <b>MCL_CURRENT </b>or <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>or both.

       If <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>has been specified, then a later system call (e.g.,
       <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="sbrk.2.html">sbrk(2)</a>, <a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>), may fail if it would cause the number
       of locked bytes to exceed the permitted maximum (see below).  In the
       same circumstances, stack growth may likewise fail: the kernel will
       deny stack expansion and deliver a <b>SIGSEGV </b>signal to the process.

       <b>munlockall</b>() unlocks all pages mapped into the address space of the
       calling process.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>(Linux 2.6.9 and later) the caller had a nonzero
              <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>soft resource limit, but tried to lock more
              memory than the limit permitted.  This limit is not enforced
              if the process is privileged (<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>).

       <b>ENOMEM </b>(Linux 2.4 and earlier) the calling process tried to lock more
              than half of RAM.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller is not privileged, but needs privilege
              (<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) to perform the requested operation.

       For <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), and <b>munlock</b>():

       <b>EAGAIN </b>Some or all of the specified address range could not be
              locked.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The result of the addition <i>addr</i>+<i>len</i> was less than <i>addr</i> (e.g.,
              the addition may have resulted in an overflow).

       <b>EINVAL </b>(Not on Linux) <i>addr</i> was not a multiple of the page size.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Some of the specified address range does not correspond to
              mapped pages in the address space of the process.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Locking or unlocking a region would result in the total number
              of mappings with distinct attributes (e.g., locked versus
              unlocked) exceeding the allowed maximum.  (For example,
              unlocking a range in the middle of a currently locked mapping
              would result in three mappings: two locked mappings at each
              end and an unlocked mapping in the middle.)

       For <b>mlock2</b>():

       <b>EINVAL </b>Unknown <i>flags</i> were specified.

       For <b>mlockall</b>():

       <b>EINVAL </b>Unknown <i>flags</i> were specified or <b>MCL_ONFAULT </b>was specified
              without either <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>or <b>MCL_CURRENT</b>.

       For <b>munlockall</b>():

       <b>EPERM  </b>(Linux 2.6.8 and earlier) The caller was not privileged
              (<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>).

<h2><a id="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Memory locking has two main applications: real-time algorithms and
       high-security data processing.  Real-time applications require
       deterministic timing, and, like scheduling, paging is one major cause
       of unexpected program execution delays.  Real-time applications will
       usually also switch to a real-time scheduler with
       <a href="sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>.  Cryptographic security software often handles
       critical bytes like passwords or secret keys as data structures.  As
       a result of paging, these secrets could be transferred onto a
       persistent swap store medium, where they might be accessible to the
       enemy long after the security software has erased the secrets in RAM
       and terminated.  (But be aware that the suspend mode on laptops and
       some desktop computers will save a copy of the system's RAM to disk,
       regardless of memory locks.)

       Real-time processes that are using <b>mlockall</b>() to prevent delays on
       page faults should reserve enough locked stack pages before entering
       the time-critical section, so that no page fault can be caused by
       function calls.  This can be achieved by calling a function that
       allocates a sufficiently large automatic variable (an array) and
       writes to the memory occupied by this array in order to touch these
       stack pages.  This way, enough pages will be mapped for the stack and
       can be locked into RAM.  The dummy writes ensure that not even copy-
       on-write page faults can occur in the critical section.

       Memory locks are not inherited by a child created via <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and are
       automatically removed (unlocked) during an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> or when the
       process terminates.  The <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>and <b>MCL_FUTURE |</b>
       <b>MCL_ONFAULT </b>settings are not inherited by a child created via <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
       and are cleared during an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       Note that <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> will prepare the address space for a copy-on-write
       operation.  The consequence is that any write access that follows
       will cause a page fault that in turn may cause high latencies for a
       real-time process.  Therefore, it is crucial not to invoke <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
       after an <b>mlockall</b>() or <b>mlock</b>() operation—not even from a thread which
       runs at a low priority within a process which also has a thread
       running at elevated priority.

       The memory lock on an address range is automatically removed if the
       address range is unmapped via <a href="munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a>.

       Memory locks do not stack, that is, pages which have been locked
       several times by calls to <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), or <b>mlockall</b>() will be
       unlocked by a single call to <b>munlock</b>() for the corresponding range or
       by <b>munlockall</b>().  Pages which are mapped to several locations or by
       several processes stay locked into RAM as long as they are locked at
       least at one location or by at least one process.

       If a call to <b>mlockall</b>() which uses the <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>flag is followed by
       another call that does not specify this flag, the changes made by the
       <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>call will be lost.

       The <b>mlock2</b>() <b>MLOCK_ONFAULT </b>flag and the <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_ONFAULT </b>flag
       allow efficient memory locking for applications that deal with large
       mappings where only a (small) portion of pages in the mapping are
       touched.  In such cases, locking all of the pages in a mapping would
       incur a significant penalty for memory locking.

   <b>Linux notes</b>
       Under Linux, <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), and <b>munlock</b>() automatically round
       <i>addr</i> down to the nearest page boundary.  However, the POSIX.1
       specification of <b>mlock</b>() and <b>munlock</b>() allows an implementation to
       require that <i>addr</i> is page aligned, so portable applications should
       ensure this.

       The <i>VmLck</i> field of the Linux-specific <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> file shows
       how many kilobytes of memory the process with ID <i>PID</i> has locked using
       <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), <b>mlockall</b>(), and <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>.

   <b>Limits and permissions</b>
       In Linux 2.6.8 and earlier, a process must be privileged
       (<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) in order to lock memory and the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>soft
       resource limit defines a limit on how much memory the process may
       lock.

       Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of memory that
       a privileged process can lock and the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>soft resource
       limit instead defines a limit on how much memory an unprivileged
       process may lock.
</pre>
<h2><a id="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       In Linux 4.8 and earlier, a bug in the kernel's accounting of locked
       memory for unprivileged processes (i.e., without <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) meant
       that if the region specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i> overlapped an existing
       lock, then the already locked bytes in the overlapping region were
       counted twice when checking against the limit.  Such double
       accounting could incorrectly calculate a "total locked memory" value
       for the process that exceeded the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>limit, with the
       result that <b>mlock</b>() and <b>mlock2() </b>would fail on requests that should
       have succeeded.  This bug was fixed in Linux 4.9

       In the 2.4 series Linux kernels up to and including 2.4.17, a bug
       caused the <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_FUTURE </b>flag to be inherited across a
       <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  This was rectified in kernel 2.4.18.

       Since kernel 2.6.9, if a privileged process calls
       <i>mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)</i> and later drops privileges (loses the
       <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK </b>capability by, for example, setting its effective UID to
       a nonzero value), then subsequent memory allocations (e.g., <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>,
       <a href="brk.2.html">brk(2)</a>) will fail if the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK </b>resource limit is
       encountered.
