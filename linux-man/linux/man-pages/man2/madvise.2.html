       <b>madvise</b>():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Up to and including glibc 2.19:
               _BSD_SOURCE

<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or directions to the
       kernel about the address range beginning at address <i>addr</i> and with
       size <i>length</i> bytes In most cases, the goal of such advice is to
       improve system or application performance.

       Initially, the system call supported a set of "conventional" <i>advice</i>
       values, which are also available on several other implementations.
       (Note, though, that <b>madvise</b>() is not specified in POSIX.)
       Subsequently, a number of Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have been
       added.

   <b>Conventional advice values</b>
       The <i>advice</i> values listed below allow an application to tell the
       kernel how it expects to use some mapped or shared memory areas, so
       that the kernel can choose appropriate read-ahead and caching
       techniques.  These <i>advice</i> values do not influence the semantics of
       the application (except in the case of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>), but may
       influence its performance.  All of the <i>advice</i> values listed here have
       analogs in the POSIX-specified <a href="../man3/posix_madvise.3.html">posix_madvise(3)</a> function, and the
       values have the same meanings, with the exception of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>.

       The advice is indicated in the <i>advice</i> argument, which is one of the
       following:

       <b>MADV_NORMAL</b>
              No special treatment.  This is the default.

       <b>MADV_RANDOM</b>
              Expect page references in random order.  (Hence, read ahead
              may be less useful than normally.)

       <b>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</b>
              Expect page references in sequential order.  (Hence, pages in
              the given range can be aggressively read ahead, and may be
              freed soon after they are accessed.)

       <b>MADV_WILLNEED</b>
              Expect access in the near future.  (Hence, it might be a good
              idea to read some pages ahead.)

       <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>
              Do not expect access in the near future.  (For the time being,
              the application is finished with the given range, so the
              kernel can free resources associated with it.)

              After a successful <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>operation, the semantics of
              memory access in the specified region are changed: subsequent
              accesses of pages in the range will succeed, but will result
              in either repopulating the memory contents from the up-to-date
              contents of the underlying mapped file (for shared file
              mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and shmem-based
              techniques such as System V shared memory segments) or zero-
              fill-on-demand pages for anonymous private mappings.

              Note that, when applied to shared mappings, <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>
              might not lead to immediate freeing of the pages in the range.
              The kernel is free to delay freeing the pages until an
              appropriate moment.  The resident set size (RSS) of the
              calling process will be immediately reduced however.

              <b>MADV_DONTNEED </b>cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB
              pages, or <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>pages.  (Pages marked with the kernel-
              internal <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>flag are special memory areas that are not
              managed by the virtual memory subsystem.  Such pages are
              typically created by device drivers that map the pages into
              user space.)

   <b>Linux-specific advice values</b>
       The following Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have no counterparts in
       the POSIX-specified <a href="../man3/posix_madvise.3.html">posix_madvise(3)</a>, and may or may not have
       counterparts in the <b>madvise</b>() interface available on other
       implementations.  Note that some of these operations change the
       semantics of memory accesses.

       <b>MADV_REMOVE </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Free up a given range of pages and its associated backing
              store.  This is equivalent to punching a hole in the
              corresponding byte range of the backing store (see
              <a href="fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a>).  Subsequent accesses in the specified address
              range will see bytes containing zero.

              The specified address range must be mapped shared and
              writable.  This flag cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge
              TLB pages, or <b>VM_PFNMAP </b>pages.

              In the initial implementation, only <a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> is supported
              <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>; but since Linux 3.5, any filesystem which
              supports the <a href="fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> <b>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE </b>mode also
              supports <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>.  Hugetlbfs will fail with the error
              <b>EINVAL </b>and other filesystems fail with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>.

       <b>MADV_DONTFORK </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Do not make the pages in this range available to the child
              after a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  This is useful to prevent copy-on-write
              semantics from changing the physical location of a page if the
              parent writes to it after a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  (Such page relocations
              cause problems for hardware that DMAs into the page.)

       <b>MADV_DOFORK </b>(since Linux 2.6.16)
              Undo the effect of <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>, restoring the default
              behavior, whereby a mapping is inherited across <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       <b>MADV_HWPOISON </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Poison the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> and
              handle subsequent references to those pages like a hardware
              memory corruption.  This operation is available only for
              privileged (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) processes.  This operation may
              result in the calling process receiving a <b>SIGBUS </b>and the page
              being unmapped.

              This feature is intended for testing of memory error-handling
              code; it is available only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Enable Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) for the pages in the
              range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  The kernel regularly
              scans those areas of user memory that have been marked as
              mergeable, looking for pages with identical content.  These
              are replaced by a single write-protected page (which is
              automatically copied if a process later wants to update the
              content of the page).  KSM merges only private anonymous pages
              (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              The KSM feature is intended for applications that generate
              many instances of the same data (e.g., virtualization systems
              such as KVM).  It can consume a lot of processing power; use
              with care.  See the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/vm/ksm.txt</i> for more details.

              The <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>and <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE </b>operations are
              available only if the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_KSM</b>.

       <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_MERGEABLE </b>operation on the
              specified address range; KSM unmerges whatever pages it had
              merged in the address range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.

       <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE </b>(since Linux 2.6.33)
              Soft offline the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
              <i>length</i>.  The memory of each page in the specified range is
              preserved (i.e., when next accessed, the same content will be
              visible, but in a new physical page frame), and the original
              page is offlined (i.e., no longer used, and taken out of
              normal memory management).  The effect of the
              <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE </b>operation is invisible to (i.e., does not
              change the semantics of) the calling process.

              This feature is intended for testing of memory error-handling
              code; it is available only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>(since Linux 2.6.38)
              Enable Transparent Huge Pages (THP) for pages in the range
              specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  Currently, Transparent Huge
              Pages work only with private anonymous pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).
              The kernel will regularly scan the areas marked as huge page
              candidates to replace them with huge pages.  The kernel will
              also allocate huge pages directly when the region is naturally
              aligned to the huge page size (see <b>posix_memalign</b>(2)).

              This feature is primarily aimed at applications that use large
              mappings of data and access large regions of that memory at a
              time (e.g., virtualization systems such as QEMU).  It can very
              easily waste memory (e.g., a 2MB mapping that only ever
              accesses 1 byte will result in 2MB of wired memory instead of
              one 4KB page).  See the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt</i> for more details.

              The <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE </b>and <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE </b>operations are available
              only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE</b>.

       <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE </b>(since Linux 2.6.38)
              Ensures that memory in the address range specified by <i>addr</i> and
              <i>length</i> will not be collapsed into huge pages.

       <b>MADV_DONTDUMP </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Exclude from a core dump those pages in the range specified by
              <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.  This is useful in applications that have
              large areas of memory that are known not to be useful in a
              core dump.  The effect of <b>MADV_DONTDUMP </b>takes precedence over
              the bit mask that is set via the <i>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</i>
              file (see <a href="../man5/core.5.html">core(5)</a>).

       <b>MADV_DODUMP </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b>.

       <b>MADV_FREE </b>(since Linux 4.5)
              The application no longer requires the pages in the range
              specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i>.  The kernel can thus free these
              pages, but the freeing could be delayed until memory pressure
              occurs.  For each of the pages that has been marked to be
              freed but has not yet been freed, the free operation will be
              canceled if the caller writes into the page.  After a
              successful <b>MADV_FREE </b>operation, any stale data (i.e., dirty,
              unwritten pages) will be lost when the kernel frees the pages.
              However, subsequent writes to pages in the range will succeed
              and then kernel cannot free those dirtied pages, so that the
              caller can always see just written data.  If there is no
              subsequent write, the kernel can free the pages at any time.
              Once pages in the range have been freed, the caller will see
              zero-fill-on-demand pages upon subsequent page references.

              The <b>MADV_FREE </b>operation can be applied only to private
              anonymous pages (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).  On a swapless system, freeing
              pages in a given range happens instantly, regardless of memory
              pressure.
