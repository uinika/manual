       <b>prctl</b>() is called with a first argument describing what to do (with
       values defined in <i>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</i>), and further arguments with a
       significance depending on the first one.  The first argument can be:

       <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT </b>(since Linux 4.3)
              Reads or changes the ambient capability set of the calling
              thread, according to the value of <i>arg2</i>, which must be one of
              the following:

              <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE</b>
                     The capability specified in <i>arg3</i> is added to the
                     ambient set.  The specified capability must already be
                     present in both the permitted and the inheritable sets
                     of the process.  This operation is not permitted if the
                     <b>SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE </b>securebit is set.

              <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_LOWER</b>
                     The capability specified in <i>arg3</i> is removed from the
                     ambient set.

              <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_IS_SET</b>
                     The <b>prctl</b>() call returns 1 if the capability in <i>arg3</i> is
                     in the ambient set and 0 if it is not.

              <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL</b>
                     All capabilities will be removed from the ambient set.
                     This operation requires setting <i>arg3</i> to zero.

              In all of the above operations, <i>arg4</i> and <i>arg5</i> must be
              specified as 0.

       <b>PR_CAPBSET_READ </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified
              in <i>arg2</i> is in the calling thread's capability bounding set, or
              0 if it is not.  (The capability constants are defined in
              <i>&lt;linux/capability.h&gt;</i>.)  The capability bounding set dictates
              whether the process can receive the capability through a
              file's permitted capability set on a subsequent call to
              <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              If the capability specified in <i>arg2</i> is not valid, then the
              call fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

       <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              If the calling thread has the <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>capability within
              its user namespace, then drop the capability specified by <i>arg2</i>
              from the calling thread's capability bounding set.  Any
              children of the calling thread will inherit the newly reduced
              bounding set.

              The call fails with the error: <b>EPERM </b>if the calling thread
              does not have the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>; <b>EINVAL </b>if <i>arg2</i> does not
              represent a valid capability; or <b>EINVAL </b>if file capabilities
              are not enabled in the kernel, in which case bounding sets are
              not supported.

       <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              If <i>arg2</i> is nonzero, set the "child subreaper" attribute of the
              calling process; if <i>arg2</i> is zero, unset the attribute.

              A subreaper fulfills the role of <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> for its descendant
              processes.  When a process becomes orphaned (i.e., its
              immediate parent terminates) then that process will be
              reparented to the nearest still living ancestor subreaper.
              Subsequently, calls to <b>getppid</b>() in the orphaned process will
              now return the PID of the subreaper process, and when the
              orphan terminates, it is the subreaper process that will
              receive a <b>SIGCHLD </b>signal and will be able to <a href="wait.2.html">wait(2)</a> on the
              process to discover its termination status.

              The setting of this bit is not inherited by children created
              by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.  The setting is preserved across
              <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              Establishing a subreaper process is useful in session
              management frameworks where a hierarchical group of processes
              is managed by a subreaper process that needs to be informed
              when one of the processes—for example, a double-forked daemon—
              terminates (perhaps so that it can restart that process).
              Some <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> frameworks (e.g., <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>) employ a subreaper
              process for similar reasons.

       <b>PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              Return the "child subreaper" setting of the caller, in the
              location pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>(since Linux 2.3.20)
              Set the state of the "dumpable" flag, which determines whether
              core dumps are produced for the calling process upon delivery
              of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.

              In kernels up to and including 2.6.12, <i>arg2</i> must be either 0
              (<b>SUID_DUMP_DISABLE</b>, process is not dumpable) or 1
              (<b>SUID_DUMP_USER</b>, process is dumpable).  Between kernels 2.6.13
              and 2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any
              binary which normally would not be dumped to be dumped
              readable by root only; for security reasons, this feature has
              been removed.  (See also the description of <i>/proc/sys/fs/</i>
              <i>suid_dumpable</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.)

              Normally, this flag is set to 1.  However, it is reset to the
              current value contained in the file <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i>
              (which by default has the value 0), in the following
              circumstances:

              *  The process's effective user or group ID is changed.

              *  The process's filesystem user or group ID is changed (see
                 <a href="../man7/credentials.7.html">credentials(7)</a>).

              *  The process executes (<a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>) a set-user-ID or set-
                 group-ID program, resulting in a change of either the
                 effective user ID or the effective group ID.

              *  The process executes (<a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>) a program that has file
                 capabilities (see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>), but only if the
                 permitted capabilities gained exceed those already
                 permitted for the process.

              Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via
              <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a> <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>; see <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a> for further details.

              If a process is not dumpable, the ownership of files in the
              process's <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directory is affected as described in
              <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_DUMPABLE </b>(since Linux 2.3.20)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the
              calling process's dumpable flag.

       <b>PR_SET_ENDIAN </b>(since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given
              in <i>arg2</i>, which should be one of the following: <b>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</b>,
              <b>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</b>, or <b>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE </b>(PowerPC pseudo
              little endian).

       <b>PR_GET_ENDIAN </b>(since Linux 2.6.18, PowerPC only)
              Return the endian-ness of the calling process, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_FP_MODE </b>(since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)
              On the MIPS architecture, user-space code can be built using
              an ABI which permits linking with code that has more
              restrictive floating-point (FP) requirements.  For example,
              user-space code may be built to target the O32 FPXX ABI and
              linked with code built for either one of the more restrictive
              FP32 or FP64 ABIs.  When more restrictive code is linked in,
              the overall requirement for the process is to use the more
              restrictive floating-point mode.

              Because the kernel has no means of knowing in advance which
              mode the process should be executed in, and because these
              restrictions can change over the lifetime of the process, the
              <b>PR_SET_FP_MODE </b>operation is provided to allow control of the
              floating-point mode from user space.

              The <i>(unsigned int) arg2</i> argument is a bit mask describing the
              floating-point mode used:

              <b>PR_FP_MODE_FR</b>
                     When this bit is <i>unset</i> (so called <b>FR=0 </b>or <b>FR0 </b>mode),
                     the 32 floating-point registers are 32 bits wide, and
                     64-bit registers are represented as a pair of registers
                     (even- and odd- numbered, with the even-numbered
                     register containing the lower 32 bits, and the odd-
                     numbered register containing the higher 32 bits).

                     When this bit is <i>set</i> (on supported hardware), the 32
                     floating-point registers are 64 bits wide (so called
                     <b>FR=1 </b>or <b>FR1 </b>mode).  Note that modern MIPS
                     implementations (MIPS R6 and newer) support <b>FR=1 </b>mode
                     only.

                     Applications that use the O32 FP32 ABI can operate only
                     when this bit is <i>unset</i> (<b>FR=0</b>; or they can be used with
                     FRE enabled, see below).  Applications that use the O32
                     FP64 ABI (and the O32 FP64A ABI, which exists to
                     provide the ability to operate with existing FP32 code;
                     see below) can operate only when this bit is <i>set</i>
                     (<b>FR=1</b>).  Applications that use the O32 FPXX ABI can
                     operate with either <b>FR=0 </b>or <b>FR=1</b>.

              <b>PR_FP_MODE_FRE</b>
                     Enable emulation of 32-bit floating-point mode.  When
                     this mode is enabled, it emulates 32-bit floating-point
                     operations by raising a reserved-instruction exception
                     on every instruction that uses 32-bit formats and the
                     kernel then handles the instruction in software.  (The
                     problem lies in the discrepancy of handling odd-
                     numbered registers which are the high 32 bits of 64-bit
                     registers with even numbers in <b>FR=0 </b>mode and the lower
                     32-bit parts of odd-numbered 64-bit registers in <b>FR=1</b>
                     mode.)  Enabling this bit is necessary when code with
                     the O32 FP32 ABI should operate with code with
                     compatible the O32 FPXX or O32 FP64A ABIs (which
                     require <b>FR=1 </b>FPU mode) or when it is executed on newer
                     hardware (MIPS R6 onwards) which lacks <b>FR=0 </b>mode
                     support when a binary with the FP32 ABI is used.

                     Note that this mode makes sense only when the FPU is in
                     64-bit mode (<b>FR=1</b>).

                     Note that the use of emulation inherently has a
                     significant performance hit and should be avoided if
                     possible.

              In the N32/N64 ABI, 64-bit floating-point mode is always used,
              so FPU emulation is not required and the FPU always operates
              in <b>FR=1 </b>mode.

              This option is mainly intended for use by the dynamic linker
              (<a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>).

              The arguments <i>arg3</i>, <i>arg4</i>, and <i>arg5</i> are ignored.

       <b>PR_GET_FP_MODE </b>(since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)
              Get the current floating-point mode (see the description of
              <b>PR_SET_FP_MODE </b>for details).

              On success, the call returns a bit mask which represents the
              current floating-point mode.

              The arguments <i>arg2</i>, <i>arg3</i>, <i>arg4</i>, and <i>arg5</i> are ignored.

       <b>PR_SET_FPEMU </b>(since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Set floating-point emulation control bits to <i>arg2</i>.  Pass
              <b>PR_FPEMU_NOPRINT </b>to silently emulate floating-point operation
              accesses, or <b>PR_FPEMU_SIGFPE </b>to not emulate floating-point
              operations and send <b>SIGFPE </b>instead.

       <b>PR_GET_FPEMU </b>(since Linux 2.4.18, 2.5.9, only on ia64)
              Return floating-point emulation control bits, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_FPEXC </b>(since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Set floating-point exception mode to <i>arg2</i>.  Pass
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_SW_ENABLE </b>to use FPEXC for FP exception enables,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_DIV </b>for floating-point divide by zero, <b>PR_FP_EXC_OVF</b>
              for floating-point overflow, <b>PR_FP_EXC_UND </b>for floating-point
              underflow, <b>PR_FP_EXC_RES </b>for floating-point inexact result,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_INV </b>for floating-point invalid operation,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_DISABLED </b>for FP exceptions disabled,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_NONRECOV </b>for async nonrecoverable exception mode,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_ASYNC </b>for async recoverable exception mode,
              <b>PR_FP_EXC_PRECISE </b>for precise exception mode.

       <b>PR_GET_FPEXC </b>(since Linux 2.4.21, 2.5.32, only on PowerPC)
              Return floating-point exception mode, in the location pointed
              to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS </b>(since Linux 2.2.18)
              Set the state of the calling thread's "keep capabilities"
              flag, which determines whether the thread's permitted
              capability set is cleared when a change is made to the
              thread's user IDs such that the thread's real UID, effective
              UID, and saved set-user-ID all become nonzero when at least
              one of them previously had the value 0.  By default, the
              permitted capability set is cleared when such a change is
              made; setting the "keep capabilities" flag prevents it from
              being cleared.  <i>arg2</i> must be either 0 (permitted capabilities
              are cleared) or 1 (permitted capabilities are kept).  (A
              thread's <i>effective</i> capability set is always cleared when such
              a credential change is made, regardless of the setting of the
              "keep capabilities" flag.)  The "keep capabilities" value will
              be reset to 0 on subsequent calls to <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_KEEPCAPS </b>(since Linux 2.2.18)
              Return (as the function result) the current state of the
              calling thread's "keep capabilities" flag.

       <b>PR_MCE_KILL </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Set the machine check memory corruption kill policy for the
              calling thread.  If <i>arg2</i> is <b>PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR</b>, clear the
              thread memory corruption kill policy and use the system-wide
              default.  (The system-wide default is defined by
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill</i>; see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.)  If <i>arg2</i>
              is <b>PR_MCE_KILL_SET</b>, use a thread-specific memory corruption
              kill policy.  In this case, <i>arg3</i> defines whether the policy is
              <i>early kill</i> (<b>PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY</b>), <i>late kill</i> (<b>PR_MCE_KILL_LATE</b>),
              or the system-wide default (<b>PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT</b>).  Early kill
              means that the thread receives a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal as soon as
              hardware memory corruption is detected inside its address
              space.  In late kill mode, the process is killed only when it
              accesses a corrupted page.  See <a href="sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a> for more
              information on the <b>SIGBUS </b>signal.  The policy is inherited by
              children.  The remaining unused <b>prctl</b>() arguments must be zero
              for future compatibility.

       <b>PR_MCE_KILL_GET </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Return the current per-process machine check kill policy.  All
              unused <b>prctl</b>() arguments must be zero.

       <b>PR_SET_MM </b>(since Linux 3.3)
              Modify certain kernel memory map descriptor fields of the
              calling process.  Usually these fields are set by the kernel
              and dynamic loader (see <a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a> for more information) and a
              regular application should not use this feature.  However,
              there are cases, such as self-modifying programs, where a
              program might find it useful to change its own memory map.

              The calling process must have the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE </b>capability.
              The value in <i>arg2</i> is one of the options below, while <i>arg3</i>
              provides a new value for the option.  The <i>arg4</i> and <i>arg5</i>
              arguments must be zero if unused.

              Since Linux 3.10, this feature is available all the time.
              Before Linux 3.10, this feature is available only if the
              kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>option
              enabled.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_START_CODE</b>
                     Set the address above which the program text can run.
                     The corresponding memory area must be readable and
                     executable, but not writable or sharable (see
                     <a href="mprotect.2.html">mprotect(2)</a> and <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> for more information).

              <b>PR_SET_MM_END_CODE</b>
                     Set the address below which the program text can run.
                     The corresponding memory area must be readable and
                     executable, but not writable or sharable.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_START_DATA</b>
                     Set the address above which initialized and
                     uninitialized (bss) data are placed.  The corresponding
                     memory area must be readable and writable, but not
                     executable or sharable.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_END_DATA</b>
                     Set the address below which initialized and
                     uninitialized (bss) data are placed.  The corresponding
                     memory area must be readable and writable, but not
                     executable or sharable.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_START_STACK</b>
                     Set the start address of the stack.  The corresponding
                     memory area must be readable and writable.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</b>
                     Set the address above which the program heap can be
                     expanded with <a href="brk.2.html">brk(2)</a> call.  The address must be greater
                     than the ending address of the current program data
                     segment.  In addition, the combined size of the
                     resulting heap and the size of the data segment can't
                     exceed the <b>RLIMIT_DATA </b>resource limit (see
                     <a href="setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)</a>).

              <b>PR_SET_MM_BRK</b>
                     Set the current <a href="brk.2.html">brk(2)</a> value.  The requirements for the
                     address are the same as for the <b>PR_SET_MM_START_BRK</b>
                     option.

              The following options are available since Linux 3.5.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>
                     Set the address above which the program command line is
                     placed.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</b>
                     Set the address below which the program command line is
                     placed.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</b>
                     Set the address above which the program environment is
                     placed.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END</b>
                     Set the address below which the program environment is
                     placed.

                     The address passed with <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>,
                     <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_END</b>, <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_START</b>, and
                     <b>PR_SET_MM_ENV_END </b>should belong to a process stack
                     area.  Thus, the corresponding memory area must be
                     readable, writable, and (depending on the kernel
                     configuration) have the <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN </b>attribute set
                     (see <a href="mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).

              <b>PR_SET_MM_AUXV</b>
                     Set a new auxiliary vector.  The <i>arg3</i> argument should
                     provide the address of the vector.  The <i>arg4</i> is the
                     size of the vector.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_EXE_FILE</b>
                     Supersede the <i>/proc/pid/exe</i> symbolic link with a new
                     one pointing to a new executable file identified by the
                     file descriptor provided in <i>arg3</i> argument.  The file
                     descriptor should be obtained with a regular <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a>
                     call.

                     To change the symbolic link, one needs to unmap all
                     existing executable memory areas, including those
                     created by the kernel itself (for example the kernel
                     usually creates at least one executable memory area for
                     the ELF <i>.text</i> section).

                     The second limitation is that such transitions can be
                     done only once in a process life time.  Any further
                     attempts will be rejected.  This should help system
                     administrators monitor unusual symbolic-link
                     transitions over all processes running on a system.

              The following options are available since Linux 3.18.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_MAP</b>
                     Provides one-shot access to all the addresses by
                     passing in a <i>struct prctl_mm_map</i> (as defined in
                     <i>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</i>).  The <i>arg4</i> argument should provide the
                     size of the struct.

                     This feature is available only if the kernel is built
                     with the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>option enabled.

              <b>PR_SET_MM_MAP_SIZE</b>
                     Returns the size of the <i>struct prctl_mm_map</i> the kernel
                     expects.  This allows user space to find a compatible
                     struct.  The <i>arg4</i> argument should be a pointer to an
                     unsigned int.

                     This feature is available only if the kernel is built
                     with the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>option enabled.

       <b>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</b>, <b>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT </b>(since Linux
       3.19)
              Enable or disable kernel management of Memory Protection
              eXtensions (MPX) bounds tables.  The <i>arg2</i>, <i>arg3</i>, <i>arg4</i>, and
              <i>arg5</i> arguments must be zero.

              MPX is a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds
              checking on pointers.  It consists of a set of registers
              storing bounds information and a set of special instruction
              prefixes that tell the CPU on which instructions it should do
              bounds enforcement.  There is a limited number of these
              registers and when there are more pointers than registers,
              their contents must be "spilled" into a set of tables.  These
              tables are called "bounds tables" and the MPX <b>prctl</b>()
              operations control whether the kernel manages their allocation
              and freeing.

              When management is enabled, the kernel will take over
              allocation and freeing of the bounds tables.  It does this by
              trapping the #BR exceptions that result at first use of
              missing bounds tables and instead of delivering the exception
              to user space, it allocates the table and populates the bounds
              directory with the location of the new table.  For freeing,
              the kernel checks to see if bounds tables are present for
              memory which is not allocated, and frees them if so.

              Before enabling MPX management using <b>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</b>,
              the application must first have allocated a user-space buffer
              for the bounds directory and placed the location of that
              directory in the <i>bndcfgu</i> register.

              These calls will fail if the CPU or kernel does not support
              MPX.  Kernel support for MPX is enabled via the
              <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MPX </b>configuration option.  You can check
              whether the CPU supports MPX by looking for the 'mpx' CPUID
              bit, like with the following command:

                   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ' mpx '

              A thread may not switch in or out of long (64-bit) mode while
              MPX is enabled.

              All threads in a process are affected by these calls.

              The child of a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits the state of MPX management.
              During <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, MPX management is reset to a state as if
              <b>PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT </b>had been called.

              For further information on Intel MPX, see the kernel source
              file <i>Documentation/x86/intel_mpx.txt</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_NAME </b>(since Linux 2.6.9)
              Set the name of the calling thread, using the value in the
              location pointed to by <i>(char *) arg2</i>.  The name can be up to
              16 bytes long, including the terminating null byte.  (If the
              length of the string, including the terminating null byte,
              exceeds 16 bytes, the string is silently truncated.)  This is
              the same attribute that can be set via <a href="../man3/pthread_setname_np.3.html">pthread_setname_np(3)</a>
              and retrieved using <a href="../man3/pthread_getname_np.3.html">pthread_getname_np(3)</a>.  The attribute is
              likewise accessible via <i>/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm</i>, where <i>tid</i>
              is the name of the calling thread.

       <b>PR_GET_NAME </b>(since Linux 2.6.11)
              Return the name of the calling thread, in the buffer pointed
              to by <i>(char *) arg2</i>.  The buffer should allow space for up to
              16 bytes; the returned string will be null-terminated.

       <b>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Set the calling thread's <i>no_new_privs</i> bit to the value in
              <i>arg2</i>.  With <i>no_new_privs</i> set to 1, <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> promises not to
              grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done
              without the <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> call (for example, rendering the set-
              user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-
              functional).  Once set, this bit cannot be unset.  The setting
              of this bit is inherited by children created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
              <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>, and preserved across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              Since Linux 4.10, the value of a thread's <i>no_new_privs</i> bit can
              be viewed via the <i>NoNewPrivs</i> field in the <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i>
              file.

              For more information, see the kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt</i>.  See also <a href="seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Return (as the function result) the value of the <i>no_new_privs</i>
              bit for the calling thread.  A value of 0 indicates the
              regular <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> behavior.  A value of 1 indicates <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>
              will operate in the privilege-restricting mode described
              above.

       <b>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG </b>(since Linux 2.1.57)
              Set the parent death signal of the calling process to <i>arg2</i>
              (either a signal value in the range 1..maxsig, or 0 to clear).
              This is the signal that the calling process will get when its
              parent dies.  This value is cleared for the child of a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
              and (since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23) when executing a set-user-ID
              or set-group-ID binary, or a binary that has associated
              capabilities (see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).  This value is preserved
              across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              <i>Warning</i>: the "parent" in this case is considered to be the
              <i>thread</i> that created this process.  In other words, the signal
              will be sent when that thread terminates (via, for example,
              <a href="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit(3)</a>), rather than after all of the threads in the
              parent process terminate.

       <b>PR_GET_PDEATHSIG </b>(since Linux 2.3.15)
              Return the current value of the parent process death signal,
              in the location pointed to by <i>(int *) arg2</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              This is meaningful only when the Yama LSM is enabled and in
              mode 1 ("restricted ptrace", visible via
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</i>).  When a "ptracer process
              ID" is passed in <i>arg2</i>, the caller is declaring that the
              ptracer process can <a href="ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a> the calling process as if it
              were a direct process ancestor.  Each <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>operation
              replaces the previous "ptracer process ID".  Employing
              <b>PR_SET_PTRACER </b>with <i>arg2</i> set to 0 clears the caller's "ptracer
              process ID".  If <i>arg2</i> is <b>PR_SET_PTRACER_ANY</b>, the ptrace
              restrictions introduced by Yama are effectively disabled for
              the calling process.

              For further information, see the kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/security/Yama.txt</i>.

       <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the secure computing (seccomp) mode for the calling
              thread, to limit the available system calls.  The more recent
              <a href="seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a> system call provides a superset of the
              functionality of <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP</b>.

              The seccomp mode is selected via <i>arg2</i>.  (The seccomp constants
              are defined in <i>&lt;linux/seccomp.h&gt;</i>.)

              With <i>arg2</i> set to <b>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</b>, the only system calls
              that the thread is permitted to make are <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>,
              <a href="_exit.2-2.html">_exit(2)</a> (but not <a href="exit_group.2.html">exit_group(2)</a>), and <a href="sigreturn.2.html">sigreturn(2)</a>.  Other
              system calls result in the delivery of a <b>SIGKILL </b>signal.
              Strict secure computing mode is useful for number-crunching
              applications that may need to execute untrusted byte code,
              perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or socket.  This
              operation is available only if the kernel is configured with
              <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP </b>enabled.

              With <i>arg2</i> set to <b>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER </b>(since Linux 3.5), the
              system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley
              Packet Filter passed in <i>arg3</i>.  This argument is a pointer to
              <i>struct sock_fprog</i>; it can be designed to filter arbitrary
              system calls and system call arguments.  This mode is
              available only if the kernel is configured with
              <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER </b>enabled.

              If <b>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER </b>filters permit <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, then the
              seccomp mode is inherited by children created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>; if
              <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> is permitted, then the seccomp mode is preserved
              across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  If the filters permit <b>prctl</b>() calls, then
              additional filters can be added; they are run in order until
              the first non-allow result is seen.

              For further information, see the kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt</i>.

       <b>PR_GET_SECCOMP </b>(since Linux 2.6.23)
              Return (as the function result) the secure computing mode of
              the calling thread.  If the caller is not in secure computing
              mode, this operation returns 0; if the caller is in strict
              secure computing mode, then the <b>prctl</b>() call will cause a
              <b>SIGKILL </b>signal to be sent to the process.  If the caller is in
              filter mode, and this system call is allowed by the seccomp
              filters, it returns 2; otherwise, the process is killed with a
              <b>SIGKILL </b>signal.  This operation is available only if the
              kernel is configured with <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP </b>enabled.

              Since Linux 3.8, the <i>Seccomp</i> field of the <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i>
              file provides a method of obtaining the same information,
              without the risk that the process is killed; see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS </b>(since Linux 2.6.26)
              Set the "securebits" flags of the calling thread to the value
              supplied in <i>arg2</i>.  See <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_SECUREBITS </b>(since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return (as the function result) the "securebits" flags of the
              calling thread.  See <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.

       <b>PR_SET_THP_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 3.15)
              Set the state of the "THP disable" flag for the calling
              thread.  If <i>arg2</i> has a nonzero value, the flag is set,
              otherwise it is cleared.  Setting this flag provides a method
              for disabling transparent huge pages for jobs where the code
              cannot be modified, and using a malloc hook with <a href="madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> is
              not an option (i.e., statically allocated data).  The setting
              of the "THP disable" flag is inherited by a child created via
              <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and is preserved across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.31)
              Disable all performance counters attached to the calling
              process, regardless of whether the counters were created by
              this process or another process.  Performance counters created
              by the calling process for other processes are unaffected.
              For more information on performance counters, see the Linux
              kernel source file <i>tools/perf/design.txt</i>.

              Originally called <b>PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_DISABLE</b>; renamed (with
              same numerical value) in Linux 2.6.32.

       <b>PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_ENABLE </b>(since Linux 2.6.31)
              The converse of <b>PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_DISABLE</b>; enable
              performance counters attached to the calling process.

              Originally called <b>PR_TASK_PERF_COUNTERS_ENABLE</b>; renamed in
              Linux 2.6.32.

       <b>PR_GET_THP_DISABLE </b>(since Linux 3.15)
              Return (via the function result) the current setting of the
              "THP disable" flag for the calling thread: either 1, if the
              flag is set, or 0, if it is not.

       <b>PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS </b>(since Linux 3.5)
              Retrieve the <i>clear_child_tid</i> address set by <a href="set_tid_address.2.html">set_tid_address(2)</a>
              and the <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> <b>CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID </b>flag, in the location
              pointed to by <i>(int **) arg2</i>.  This feature is available only
              if the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b>
              option enabled.  Note that since the <b>prctl</b>() system call does
              not have a compat implementation for the AMD64 x32 and MIPS
              n32 ABIs, and the kernel writes out a pointer using the
              kernel's pointer size, this operation expects a user-space
              buffer of 8 (not 4) bytes on these ABIs.

       <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK </b>(since Linux 2.6.28)
              Each thread has two associated timer slack values: a "default"
              value, and a "current" value.  This operation sets the
              "current" timer slack value for the calling thread.  If the
              nanosecond value supplied in <i>arg2</i> is greater than zero, then
              the "current" value is set to this value.  If <i>arg2</i> is less
              than or equal to zero, the "current" timer slack is reset to
              the thread's "default" timer slack value.

              The "current" timer slack is used by the kernel to group timer
              expirations for the calling thread that are close to one
              another; as a consequence, timer expirations for the thread
              may be up to the specified number of nanoseconds late (but
              will never expire early).  Grouping timer expirations can help
              reduce system power consumption by minimizing CPU wake-ups.

              The timer expirations affected by timer slack are those set by
              <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="pselect.2.html">pselect(2)</a>, <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="ppoll.2.html">ppoll(2)</a>, <a href="epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>,

              (and thus the library functions implemented via futexes,
              including <b>pthread_cond_timedwait</b>(3),
              <b>pthread_mutex_timedlock</b>(3), <b>pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock</b>(3),
              <b>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</b>(3), and <a href="../man3/sem_timedwait.3.html">sem_timedwait(3)</a>).

              Timer slack is not applied to threads that are scheduled under
              a real-time scheduling policy (see <a href="sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>).

              When a new thread is created, the two timer slack values are
              made the same as the "current" value of the creating thread.
              Thereafter, a thread can adjust its "current" timer slack
              value via <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</b>.  The "default" value can't be
              changed.  The timer slack values of <i>init</i> (PID 1), the ancestor
              of all processes, are 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).
              The timer slack values are preserved across <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

              Since Linux 4.6, the "current" timer slack value of any
              process can be examined and changed via the file
              <i>/proc/[pid]/timerslack_ns</i>.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>PR_GET_TIMERSLACK </b>(since Linux 2.6.28)
              Return (as the function result) the "current" timer slack
              value of the calling thread.

       <b>PR_SET_TIMING </b>(since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Set whether to use (normal, traditional) statistical process
              timing or accurate timestamp-based process timing, by passing
              <b>PR_TIMING_STATISTICAL </b>or <b>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP </b>to <i>arg2</i>.
              <b>PR_TIMING_TIMESTAMP </b>is not currently implemented (attempting
              to set this mode will yield the error <b>EINVAL</b>).

       <b>PR_GET_TIMING </b>(since Linux 2.6.0-test4)
              Return (as the function result) which process timing method is

       <b>PR_SET_TSC </b>(since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
              Set the state of the flag determining whether the timestamp

              <b>SIGSEGV </b>when the process tries to read the timestamp counter.

       <b>PR_GET_TSC </b>(since Linux 2.6.26, x86 only)
