       <b>mount</b>() attaches the filesystem specified by <i>source</i> (which is often a
       pathname referring to a device, but can also be the pathname of a
       directory or file, or a dummy string) to the location (a directory or
       file) specified by the pathname in <i>target</i>.

       Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability) is
       required to mount filesystems.

       Values for the <i>filesystemtype</i> argument supported by the kernel are
       listed in <i>/proc/filesystems</i> (e.g., "btrfs", "ext4", "jfs", "xfs",
       "vfat", "fuse", "tmpfs", "cgroup", "proc", "mqueue", "nfs", "cifs",
       "iso9660").  Further types may become available when the appropriate
       modules are loaded.

       The <i>data</i> argument is interpreted by the different filesystems.
       Typically it is a string of comma-separated options understood by
       this filesystem.  See <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> for details of the options available
       for each filesystem type.

       A call to <b>mount</b>() performs one of a number of general types of
       operation, depending on the bits specified in <i>mountflags</i>.  The choice
       of which operation to perform is determined by testing the bits set
       in <i>mountflags</i>, with the tests being conducted in the order listed
       here:

       *  Remount an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>.

       *  Create a bind mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b>.

       *  Change the propagation type of an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i>
          includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>.

       *  Move an existing mount to a new location: <i>mountflags</i> includes
          <b>MS_MOVE</b>.

       *  Create a new mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes none of the above flags.

       Each of these operations is detailed later in this page.  Further
       flags may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of
       <b>mount</b>(), as described below.

   <b>Additional mount flags</b>
       The list below describes the additional flags that can be specified
       in <i>mountflags</i>.  Note that some operation types ignore some or all of
       these flags, as described later in this page.

       <b>MS_DIRSYNC </b>(since Linux 2.5.19)
              Make directory changes on this filesystem synchronous.  (This
              property can be obtained for individual directories or
              subtrees using <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr(1)</a>.)

       <b>MS_LAZYTIME </b>(since Linux 4.0)
              Reduce on-disk updates of inode timestamps (atime, mtime,
              ctime) by maintaining these changes only in memory.  The on-
              disk timestamps are updated only when:

              (a)  the inode needs to be updated for some change unrelated
                   to file timestamps;

              (b)  the application employs sync(2);

              (c)  an undeleted inode is evicted from memory; or

              (d)  more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was
                   written to disk.

              This mount option significantly reduces writes needed to
              update the inode's timestamps, especially mtime and atime.
              However, in the event of a system crash, the atime and mtime
              fields on disk might be out of date by up to 24 hours.

       Examples of workloads where this option could be of significant
       benefit include frequent random writes to preallocated files, as well
       as cases where the <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>mount option is also enabled.  (The
       advantage of combining <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>and <b>MS_LAZYTIME </b>is that <a href="stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>
       will return the correctly updated atime, but the atime updates will
       be flushed to disk only in the cases listed above.)

       <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>
              Permit mandatory locking on files in this filesystem.
              (Mandatory locking must still be enabled on a per-file basis,
              as described in <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.)  Since Linux 4.5, this mount option
              requires the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability.

       <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this
              filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODEV</b>
              Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this
              filesystem.

       <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>
              Do not update access times for directories on this filesystem.
              This flag provides a subset of the functionality provided by
              <b>MS_NOATIME</b>; that is, <b>MS_NOATIME </b>implies <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.

       <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>
              Do not allow programs to be executed from this filesystem.

       <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
              Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file
              capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem.

       <b>MS_RDONLY</b>
              Mount filesystem read-only.

       <b>MS_REC </b>(since Linux 2.4.11)
              Used in conjunction with <b>MS_BIND </b>to create a recursive bind
              mount, and in conjunction with the propagation type flags to
              recursively change the propagation type of all of the mounts
              in a subtree.  See below for further details.

       <b>MS_RELATIME </b>(since Linux 2.6.20)
              When a file on this filesystem is accessed, update the file's
              last access time (atime) only if the current value of atime is
              less than or equal to the file's last modification time
              (mtime) or last status change time (ctime).  This option is
              useful for programs, such as <b>mutt</b>(1), that need to know when a
              file has been read since it was last modified.  Since Linux
              2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this
              flag (unless <b>MS_NOATIME </b>was specified), and the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>
              flag is required to obtain traditional semantics.  In
              addition, since Linux 2.6.30, the file's last access time is
              always updated if it is more than 1 day old.

       <b>MS_SILENT </b>(since Linux 2.6.17)
              Suppress the display of certain (<i>printk</i>()) warning messages in
              the kernel log.  This flag supersedes the misnamed and
              obsolete <b>MS_VERBOSE </b>flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which
              has the same meaning.

       <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>(since Linux 2.6.30)
              Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this
              filesystem are accessed.  (This was the default behavior
              before Linux 2.6.30.)  Specifying this flag overrides the
              effect of setting the <b>MS_NOATIME </b>and <b>MS_RELATIME </b>flags.

       <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>
              Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (as though the
              <b>O_SYNC </b>flag to <a href="open.2.html">open(2)</a> was specified for all file opens to
              this filesystem).

       From Linux 2.4 onward, the <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID </b>flags
       are settable on a per-mount-point basis.  From kernel 2.6.16 onward,
       <b>MS_NOATIME </b>and <b>MS_NODIRATIME </b>are also settable on a per-mount-point
       basis.  The <b>MS_RELATIME </b>flag is also settable on a per-mount-point
       basis.  Since Linux 2.6.16, <b>MS_RDONLY </b>can be set or cleared on a per-
       mount-point basis as well as on the underlying filesystem.  The
       mounted filesystem will be writable only if neither the filesystem
       nor the mountpoint are flagged as read-only.

   <b>Remounting an existing mount</b>
       An existing mount may be remounted by specifying <b>MS_REMOUNT </b>in
       <i>mountflags</i>.  This allows you to change the <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> of an
       existing mount without having to unmount and remount the filesystem.
       <i>target</i> should be the same value specified in the initial <b>mount</b>()
       call.

       The <i>source</i> and <i>filesystemtype</i> arguments are ignored.

       The <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> arguments should match the values used in the
       original <b>mount</b>() call, except for those parameters that are being
       deliberately changed.  Another exception is that <b>MS_BIND </b>has a
       different meaning for remount, and it should be included only if
       explicitly desired.

       The following <i>mountflags</i> can be changed: <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>,
       <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>,
       <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, and <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>.  Attempts to change the
       setting of the <b>MS_DIRSYNC </b>flag during a remount are silently ignored.

       Since Linux 3.17, if none of <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>,
       or <b>MS_STRICTATIME </b>is specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then the remount
       operation preserves the existing values of these flags (rather than
       defaulting to <b>MS_RELATIME</b>).

       Since Linux 2.6.26, this flag can be used with <b>MS_BIND </b>to modify only
       the per-mount-point flags.  This is particularly useful for setting
       or clearing the "read-only" flag on a mount point without changing
       the underlying filesystem.  Specifying <i>mountflags</i> as:

           MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY

       will make access through this mountpoint read-only, without affecting
       other mount points.

   <b>Creating a bind mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND </b>(available since Linux 2.4), then
       perform a bind mount.  A bind mount makes a file or a directory
       subtree visible at another point within the single directory
       hierarchy.  Bind mounts may cross filesystem boundaries and span
       <a href="chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> jails.

       The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored.

       The remaining bits in the <i>mountflags</i> argument are also ignored, with
       the exception of <b>MS_REC</b>.  (The bind mount has the same mount options
       as the underlying mount point.)  However, see the discussion of
       remounting above, for a method of making an existing bind mount read-
       only.

       By default, when a directory is bind mounted, only that directory is
       mounted; if there are any submounts under the directory tree, they
       are not bind mounted.  If the <b>MS_REC </b>flag is also specified, then a
       recursive bind mount operation is performed: all submounts under the
       <i>source</i> subtree (other than unbindable mounts) are also bind mounted
       at the corresponding location in the <i>target</i> subtree.

   <b>Changing the propagation type of an existing mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or
       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE </b>(all available since Linux 2.6.15), then the
       propagation type of an existing mount is changed.  If more than one
       of these flags is specified, an error results.

       The only flags that can be used with changing the propagation type
       are <b>MS_REC </b>and <b>MS_SILENT</b>.

       The <i>source</i>, <i>filesystemtype</i>, and <i>data</i> arguments are ignored.

       The meanings of the propagation type flags are as follows:

       <b>MS_SHARED</b>
              Make this mount point shared.  Mount and unmount events
              immediately under this mount point will propagate to the other
              mount points that are members of this mount's peer group.
              Propagation here means that the same mount or unmount will
              automatically occur under all of the other mount points in the
              peer group.  Conversely, mount and unmount events that take
              place under peer mount points will propagate to this mount
              point.

       <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>
              Make this mount point private.  Mount and unmount events do
              not propagate into or out of this mount point.

       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>
              If this is a shared mount point that is a member of a peer
              group that contains other members, convert it to a slave
              mount.  If this is a shared mount point that is a member of a
              peer group that contains no other members, convert it to a
              private mount.  Otherwise, the propagation type of the mount
              point is left unchanged.

       When a mount point is a slave, mount and unmount events propagate
       into this mount point from the (master) shared peer group of which it
       was formerly a member.  Mount and unmount events under this mount
       point do not propagate to any peer.

       A mount point can be the slave of another peer group while at the
       same time sharing mount and unmount events with a peer group of which
       it is a member.

       <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>
              Make this mount unbindable.  This is like a private mount, and
              in addition this mount can't be bind mounted.  When a
              recursive bind mount (<b>mount</b>() with the <b>MS_BIND </b>and <b>MS_REC</b>
              flags) is performed on a directory subtree, any bind mounts
              within the subtree are automatically pruned (i.e., not
              replicated) when replicating that subtree to produce the
              target subtree.

       By default, changing the propagation type affects only the <i>target</i>
       mount point.  If the <b>MS_REC </b>flag is also specified in <i>mountflags</i>,
       then the propagation type of all mount points under <i>target</i> is also
       changed.

       For further details regarding mount propagation types (including the
       default propagation type assigned to new mounts), see
       <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

   <b>Moving a mount</b>
       If <i>mountflags</i> contains the flag <b>MS_MOVE </b>(available since Linux
       2.4.18), then move a subtree: <i>source</i> specifies an existing mount
       point and <i>target</i> specifies the new location to which that mount point
       is to be relocated.  The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree
       unmounted.

       The remaining bits in the <i>mountflags</i> argument are ignored, as are the
       <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments.

   <b>Creating a new mount point</b>
       If none of <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>, <b>MS_BIND</b>, <b>MS_MOVE</b>, <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,
       <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE </b>is specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then <b>mount</b>()
       performs its default action: creating a new mount point.  <i>source</i>
       specifies the source for the new mount point, and <i>target</i> specifies
       the directory at which to create the mount point.

       The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are employed, and further bits
       may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of the call.

       Since Linux 2.4 a single filesystem can be mounted at multiple mount
       points, and multiple mounts can be stacked on the same mount point.

       The <i>mountflags</i> argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED (<b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>)
       in the top 16 bits.  (All of the other flags discussed in DESCRIPTION
       occupy the low order 16 bits of <i>mountflags</i>.)  Specifying <b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>
       was required in kernel versions prior to 2.4, but since Linux 2.4 is
       no longer required and is ignored if specified.

       The original <b>MS_SYNC </b>flag was renamed <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS </b>in 1.1.69 when a
       different <b>MS_SYNC </b>was added to <i>&lt;mman.h&gt;</i>.

       Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID
       program on a filesystem mounted with <b>MS_NOSUID </b>would fail with <b>EPERM</b>.
       Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are just
       silently ignored in this case.

   <b>Per-process namespaces</b>
       Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides per-process mount
       namespaces.  A mount namespace is the set of filesystem mounts that
       are visible to a process.  Mount-point namespaces can be (and usually
       are) shared between multiple processes, and changes to the namespace
       (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one process are visible to all other
       processes sharing the same namespace.  (The pre-2.4.19 Linux
       situation can be considered as one in which a single namespace was
       shared by every process on the system.)

       A child process created by <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> shares its parent's mount
       namespace; the mount namespace is preserved across an <a href="execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created
       using the <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>flag, in which case its new namespace
       is initialized to be a <i>copy</i> of the namespace of the process that
       called <a href="clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>; or it calls <a href="unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>flag,
       which causes the caller's mount namespace to obtain a private copy of
       the namespace that it was previously sharing with other processes, so
       that future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible to other
       processes (except child processes that the caller subsequently
       creates) and vice versa.

       The Linux-specific <i>/proc/[pid]/mounts</i> file exposes the list of mount
       points in the mount namespace of the process with the specified ID;
       see <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for details.
