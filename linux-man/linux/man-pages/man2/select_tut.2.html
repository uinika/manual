       <b>pselect</b>(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L
</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>select</b>() (or <b>pselect</b>()) is used to efficiently monitor multiple file
       descriptors, to see if any of them is, or becomes, "ready"; that is,
       to see whether I/O becomes possible, or an "exceptional condition"
       has occurred on any of the file descriptors.

       Its principal arguments are three "sets" of file descriptors:
       <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and <i>exceptfds</i>.  Each set is declared as type
       <i>fd_set</i>, and its contents can be manipulated with the macros <b>FD_CLR</b>(),
       <b>FD_ISSET</b>(), <b>FD_SET</b>(), and <b>FD_ZERO</b>().  A newly declared set should
       first be cleared using <b>FD_ZERO</b>().  <b>select</b>() modifies the contents of
       the sets according to the rules described below; after calling
       <b>select</b>() you can test if a file descriptor is still present in a set
       with the <b>FD_ISSET</b>() macro.  <b>FD_ISSET</b>() returns nonzero if a specified
       file descriptor is present in a set and zero if it is not.  <b>FD_CLR</b>()
       removes a file descriptor from a set.

   <b>Arguments</b>
       <i>readfds</i>
              This set is watched to see if data is available for reading
              from any of its file descriptors.  After <b>select</b>() has
              returned, <i>readfds</i> will be cleared of all file descriptors
              except for those that are immediately available for reading.

       <i>writefds</i>
              This set is watched to see if there is space to write data to
              any of its file descriptors.  After <b>select</b>() has returned,
              <i>writefds</i> will be cleared of all file descriptors except for
              those that are immediately available for writing.

       <i>exceptfds</i>
              This set is watched for "exceptional conditions".  In
              practice, only one such exceptional condition is common: the
              availability of <i>out-of-band</i> (OOB) data for reading from a TCP
              socket.  See <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a>, and <a href="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a> for more details
              about OOB data.  (One other less common case where <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a>
              indicates an exceptional condition occurs with pseudoterminals
              in packet mode; see <a href="ioctl_tty.2.html">ioctl_tty(2)</a>.)  After <b>select</b>() has
              returned, <i>exceptfds</i> will be cleared of all file descriptors
              except for those for which an exceptional condition has
              occurred.

       <i>nfds</i>   This is an integer one more than the maximum of any file
              descriptor in any of the sets.  In other words, while adding
              file descriptors to each of the sets, you must calculate the
              maximum integer value of all of them, then increment this
              value by one, and then pass this as <i>nfds</i>.

       <i>utimeout</i>
              This is the longest time <b>select</b>() may wait before returning,
              even if nothing interesting happened.  If this value is passed
              as NULL, then <b>select</b>() blocks indefinitely waiting for a file
              descriptor to become ready.  <i>utimeout</i> can be set to zero
              seconds, which causes <b>select</b>() to return immediately, with
              information about the readiness of file descriptors at the
              time of the call.  The structure <i>struct timeval</i> is defined as:

                  struct timeval {
                      time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
                      long tv_usec;     /* microseconds */
                  };

       <i>ntimeout</i>
              This argument for <b>pselect</b>() has the same meaning as <i>utimeout</i>,
              but <i>struct timespec</i> has nanosecond precision as follows:

                  struct timespec {
                      long tv_sec;    /* seconds */
                      long tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
                  };

       <i>sigmask</i>
              This argument holds a set of signals that the kernel should
              unblock (i.e., remove from the signal mask of the calling
              thread), while the caller is blocked inside the <b>pselect</b>() call
              (see <a href="../man3/sigaddset.3.html">sigaddset(3)</a> and <a href="sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask(2)</a>).  It may be NULL, in
              which case the call does not modify the signal mask on entry
              and exit to the function.  In this case, <b>pselect</b>() will then
              behave just like <b>select</b>().

   <b>Combining signal and data events</b>
       <b>pselect</b>() is useful if you are waiting for a signal as well as for
       file descriptor(s) to become ready for I/O.  Programs that receive
       signals normally use the signal handler only to raise a global flag.
       The global flag will indicate that the event must be processed in the
       main loop of the program.  A signal will cause the <b>select</b>() (or
       <b>pselect</b>()) call to return with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EINTR</b>.  This behavior is
       essential so that signals can be processed in the main loop of the
       program, otherwise <b>select</b>() would block indefinitely.  Now, somewhere
       in the main loop will be a conditional to check the global flag.  So
       we must ask: what if a signal arrives after the conditional, but
       before the <b>select</b>() call?  The answer is that <b>select</b>() would block
       indefinitely, even though an event is actually pending.  This race
       condition is solved by the <b>pselect</b>() call.  This call can be used to
       set the signal mask to a set of signals that are to be received only
       within the <b>pselect</b>() call.  For instance, let us say that the event
       in question was the exit of a child process.  Before the start of the
       main loop, we would block <b>SIGCHLD </b>using <a href="sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask(2)</a>.  Our
       <b>pselect</b>() call would enable <b>SIGCHLD </b>by using an empty signal mask.
       Our program would look like:

       static volatile sig_atomic_t got_SIGCHLD = 0;

       static void
       child_sig_handler(int sig)
       {
           got_SIGCHLD = 1;
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           sigset_t sigmask, empty_mask;
           struct sigaction sa;
           fd_set readfds, writefds, exceptfds;
           int r;

           sigemptyset(&amp;sigmask);
           sigaddset(&amp;sigmask, SIGCHLD);
           if (sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sigmask, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigprocmask");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sa.sa_flags = 0;
           sa.sa_handler = child_sig_handler;
           sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
           if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &amp;sa, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigaction");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sigemptyset(&amp;empty_mask);

           for (;;) {          /* main loop */
               /* Initialize readfds, writefds, and exceptfds
                  before the pselect() call. (Code omitted.) */

               r = pselect(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds, &amp;exceptfds,
                           NULL, &amp;empty_mask);
               if (r == -1 &amp;&amp; errno != EINTR) {
                   /* Handle error */
               }

               if (got_SIGCHLD) {
                   got_SIGCHLD = 0;

                   /* Handle signalled event here; e.g., wait() for all
                      terminated children. (Code omitted.) */
               }

               /* main body of program */
           }
       }

   <b>Practical</b>
       So what is the point of <b>select</b>()?  Can't I just read and write to my
       file descriptors whenever I want?  The point of <b>select</b>() is that it
       watches multiple descriptors at the same time and properly puts the
       process to sleep if there is no activity.  UNIX programmers often
       find themselves in a position where they have to handle I/O from more
       than one file descriptor where the data flow may be intermittent.  If
       you were to merely create a sequence of <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a> calls,
       you would find that one of your calls may block waiting for data
       from/to a file descriptor, while another file descriptor is unused
       though ready for I/O.  <b>select</b>() efficiently copes with this
       situation.

   <b>Select law</b>
       Many people who try to use <b>select</b>() come across behavior that is
       difficult to understand and produces nonportable or borderline
       results.  For instance, the above program is carefully written not to
       block at any point, even though it does not set its file descriptors
       to nonblocking mode.  It is easy to introduce subtle errors that will
       remove the advantage of using <b>select</b>(), so here is a list of
       essentials to watch for when using <b>select</b>().

       1.  You should always try to use <b>select</b>() without a timeout.  Your
           program should have nothing to do if there is no data available.
           Code that depends on timeouts is not usually portable and is
           difficult to debug.

       2.  The value <i>nfds</i> must be properly calculated for efficiency as
           explained above.

       3.  No file descriptor must be added to any set if you do not intend
           to check its result after the <b>select</b>() call, and respond
           appropriately.  See next rule.

       4.  After <b>select</b>() returns, all file descriptors in all sets should
           be checked to see if they are ready.

       5.  The functions <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> do <i>not</i>
           necessarily read/write the full amount of data that you have
           requested.  If they do read/write the full amount, it's because
           you have a low traffic load and a fast stream.  This is not
           always going to be the case.  You should cope with the case of
           your functions managing to send or receive only a single byte.

       6.  Never read/write only in single bytes at a time unless you are
           really sure that you have a small amount of data to process.  It
           is extremely inefficient not to read/write as much data as you
           can buffer each time.  The buffers in the example below are 1024
           bytes although they could easily be made larger.

       7.  The functions <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> as well as
           the <b>select</b>() call can return -1 with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EINTR</b>, or with
           <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EAGAIN </b>(<b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>).  These results must be
           properly managed (not done properly above).  If your program is
           not going to receive any signals, then it is unlikely you will
           get <b>EINTR</b>.  If your program does not set nonblocking I/O, you
           will not get <b>EAGAIN</b>.

       8.  Never call <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, or <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> with a buffer
           length of zero.

       9.  If the functions <a href="read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="send.2.html">send(2)</a> fail
           with errors other than those listed in <b>7.</b>, or one of the input
           functions returns 0, indicating end of file, then you should <i>not</i>
           pass that file descriptor to <b>select</b>() again.  In the example
           below, I close the file descriptor immediately, and then set it
           to -1 to prevent it being included in a set.

       10. The timeout value must be initialized with each new call to
           <b>select</b>(), since some operating systems modify the structure.
           <b>pselect</b>() however does not modify its timeout structure.

       11. Since <b>select</b>() modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call is
           being used in a loop, then the sets must be reinitialized before
           each call.

   <b>Usleep emulation</b>
       On systems that do not have a <a href="../man3/usleep.3.html">usleep(3)</a> function, you can call
       <b>select</b>() with a finite timeout and no file descriptors as follows:

           struct timeval tv;
           tv.tv_sec = 0;
           tv.tv_usec = 200000;  /* 0.2 seconds */
           select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &amp;tv);

       This is guaranteed to work only on UNIX systems, however.

<h2><a id="RETURN_VALUE" href="#RETURN_VALUE"></a>RETURN VALUE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       On success, <b>select</b>() returns the total number of file descriptors
       still present in the file descriptor sets.

       If <b>select</b>() timed out, then the return value will be zero.  The file
       descriptors set should be all empty (but may not be on some systems).

       A return value of -1 indicates an error, with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> being set
       appropriately.  In the case of an error, the contents of the returned
       sets and the <i>struct timeout</i> contents are undefined and should not be
       used.  <b>pselect</b>() however never modifies <i>ntimeout</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Generally speaking, all operating systems that support sockets also
       support <b>select</b>().  <b>select</b>() can be used to solve many problems in a
       portable and efficient way that naive programmers try to solve in a
       more complicated manner using threads, forking, IPCs, signals, memory
       sharing, and so on.

       The <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> system call has the same functionality as <b>select</b>(), and
       is somewhat more efficient when monitoring sparse file descriptor
       sets.  It is nowadays widely available, but historically was less
       portable than <b>select</b>().

       The Linux-specific <a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> API provides an interface that is more
       efficient than <a href="select.2.html">select(2)</a> and <a href="poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> when monitoring large numbers of
       file descriptors.

       The above program properly forwards most kinds of TCP connections
       including OOB signal data transmitted by <b>telnet </b>servers.  It handles
       the tricky problem of having data flow in both directions
       simultaneously.  You might think it more efficient to use a <a href="fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
       call and devote a thread to each stream.  This becomes more tricky
       than you might suspect.  Another idea is to set nonblocking I/O using
       <a href="fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.  This also has its problems because you end up using
       inefficient timeouts.

       The program does not handle more than one simultaneous connection at
       a time, although it could easily be extended to do this with a linked
       list of buffers—one for each connection.  At the moment, new
       connections cause the current connection to be dropped.
