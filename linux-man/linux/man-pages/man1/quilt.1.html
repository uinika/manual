<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of
       the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied,
       refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary
       output is patches.

       With quilt, all work occurs within a single directory tree. Commands
       can be invoked from anywhere within the source tree. They are of the
       form <b>quilt cmd </b>similar to CVS, svn or git commands. They can be
       abbreviated as long as the specified part of the command is unique.
       All commands print some help text with <b>quilt cmd -h.</b>

       Quilt manages a stack of patches. Patches are applied incrementally
       on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be
       pushed on top of the stack (<b>quilt push</b>), and popped off the stack
       (<b>quilt pop</b>).  Commands are available for querying the contents of the
       series file (<b>quilt series</b>, see below), the contents of the stack
       (<b>quilt applied</b>, <b>quilt previous</b>, <b>quilt top</b>), and the patches that are
       not applied at a particular moment (<b>quilt next</b>, <b>quilt unapplied</b>).  By
       default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on the stack.

       Patch files are located in the <i>patches</i> sub-directory of the source
       tree (see EXAMPLE OF WORKING TREE below). The <i>QUILT_PATCHES</i>
       environment variable can be used to override this location. When not
       found in the current directory, that subdirectory is searched
       recursively in the parent directories (this is similar to the way <i>git</i>
       searches for its configuration files). The <i>patches</i> directory may
       contain sub-directories. It may also be a symbolic link instead of a
       directory.

       A file called <i>series</i> contains a list of patch file names that defines
       the order in which patches are applied. Unless there are means by
       which series files can be generated automatically, it is usually
       provided along with a set of patches. In this file, each patch file
       name is on a separate line. Patch files are identified by path names
       that are relative to the <i>patches</i> directory; patches may be in sub-
       directories below this directory. Lines in the series file that start
       with a hash character (#) are ignored.  You can also add a comment
       after each patch file name, introduced by a space  followed by a hash
       character. When quilt adds, removes, or renames patches, it
       automatically updates the series file. Users of quilt can modify
       series files while some patches are applied, as long as the applied
       patches remain in their original order.

       Different series files can be used to assemble patches in different
       ways, corresponding for example to different development branches.

       Before a patch is applied (or ``pushed on the stack''), copies of all
       files the patch modifies are saved to the .pc/<i>patch</i> directory. The
       patch is added to the list of currently applied patches (.pc/applied-
       patches). Later when a patch is regenerated (<b>quilt refresh</b>), the
       backup copies in .pc/<i>patch</i> are compared with the current versions of
       the files in the source tree using GNU diff.

       Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of a
       patch file.  Quilt is careful to preserve all text that precedes the
       actual patch when doing a refresh. (This is limited to patches in
       unified format; see <b>diff </b>documentation).

       The series file is looked up in the .pc directory, in the root of the
       source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series file
       that is found is used. This may also be a symbolic link, or a file
       with multiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file is used for
       a set of patches, so the patches sub-directory is a convenient
       location.

       The .pc directory and its sub-directories cannot be relocated, but it
       can be a symbolic link. While patches are applied to the source tree,
       this directory is essential for many operations, including taking
       patches off the stack (<b>quilt pop</b>), and refreshing patches (<b>quilt</b>
       <b>refresh</b>).  Files in the .pc directory are automatically removed when
       they are no longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.

       <b>add </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.  Files must
           be added to the patch before being modified.  Files that are
           modified by patches already applied on top of the specified patch
           cannot be added.

           -P patch

               Patch to add files to.

       <b>annotate </b>[-P patch] {file}

           Print an annotated listing of the specified file showing which
           patches modify which lines. Only applied patches are included.

           -P patch

               Stop checking for changes at the specified rather than the
               topmost patch.

       <b>applied </b>[patch]

           Print a list of applied patches, or all patches up to and
           including the specified patch in the file series.

       <b>delete </b>[-r] [--backup] [patch|-n]

           Remove the specified or topmost patch from the series file.  If
           the patch is applied, quilt will attempt to remove it first.
           (Only the topmost patch can be removed right now.)

           -n  Delete the next patch after topmost, rather than the
               specified or topmost patch.

           -r  Remove the deleted patch file from the patches directory as
               well.

           --backup

               Rename the patch file to patch~ rather than deleting it.
               Ignored if not used with `-r'.

       <b>diff </b>[-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R] [-P
       patch] [--snapshot] [--diff=utility] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index]
       [--sort] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [file ...]

           Produces a diff of the specified file(s) in the topmost or
           specified patch.  If no files are specified, all files that are
           modified are included.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
               original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context.
               Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The
               number of context lines defaults to 3.

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           -z  Write to standard output the changes that have been made
               relative to the topmost or specified patch.

           -R  Create a reverse diff.

           -P patch

               Create a diff for the specified patch.  (Defaults to the
               topmost patch.)

           --combine patch

               Create a combined diff for all patches between this patch and
               the patch specified with -P. A patch name of `-' is
               equivalent to specifying the first applied patch.

           --snapshot

               Diff against snapshot (see `quilt snapshot -h').

           --diff=utility

               Use the specified utility for generating the diff. The
               utility is invoked with the original and new file name as
               arguments.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is
               a tty).

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original
               order.

       <b>edit </b>file ...

           Edit the specified file(s) in $EDITOR after adding it (them) to
           the topmost patch.

       <b>files </b>[-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine patch] [patch]

           Print the list of files that the topmost or specified patch
           changes.

           -a  List all files in all applied patches.

           -l  Add patch name to output.

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --combine patch

               Create a listing for all patches between this patch and the
               topmost or specified patch. A patch name of `-' is equivalent
               to specifying the first applied patch.

       <b>fold </b>[-R] [-q] [-f] [-p strip-level]

           Integrate the patch read from standard input into the topmost
           patch: After making sure that all files modified are part of the
           topmost patch, the patch is applied with the specified strip
           level (which defaults to 1).

           -R  Apply patch in reverse.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects. Unless in quiet
               mode, apply the patch interactively: the patch utility may
               ask questions.

           -p strip-level

               The number of pathname components to strip from file names
               when applying patchfile.

       <b>fork </b>[new_name]

           Fork the topmost patch.  Forking a patch means creating a
           verbatim copy of it under a new name, and use that new name
           instead of the original one in the current series.  This is
           useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original version
           of it should be preserved, e.g.  because it is used in another
           series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of commands would
           be: fork, edit, refresh.

           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be the
           current patch name, followed by `-2'.  If the patch name already
           ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further incremented
           (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).

       <b>graph </b>[--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T
       ps] [patch]

           Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies between
           applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if both touch
           the same file or, with the --lines option, if their modifications
           overlap. Unless otherwise specified, the graph includes all
           patches that the topmost patch depends on.  When a patch name is
           specified, instead of the topmost patch, create a graph for the
           specified patch. The graph will include all other patches that
           this patch depends on, as well as all patches that depend on this
           patch.

           --all
               Generate a graph including all applied patches and their
               dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)

           --reduce

               Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

           --lines[=num]

               Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches
               modify.  Unless a different num is specified, two lines of
               context are included.

           --edge-labels=files

               Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent
               patches modify.

           -T ps
               Directly produce a PostScript output file.

       <b>grep </b>[-h|options] {pattern}

           Grep through the source files, recursively, skipping patches and
           quilt meta-information. If no filename argument is given, the
           whole source tree is searched. Please see the grep(1) manual page
           for options.

           -h  Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a
               double-dash (--). Search expressions that start with a dash
               can be passed after a second double-dash (-- --).

       <b>header </b>[-a|-r|-e] [--backup] [--strip-diffstat] [--strip-trailing-
       whitespace] [patch]

           Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.

           -a, -r, -e

               Append to (-a) or replace (-r) the exiting patch header, or
               edit (-e) the header in $EDITOR. If none of these options is
               given, print the patch header.

           --strip-diffstat

               Strip diffstat output from the header.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines of the header.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

       <b>import </b>[-p num] [-R] [-P patch] [-f] [-d {o|a|n}] patchfile ...

           Import external patches.  The patches will be inserted following
           the current top patch, and must be pushed after import to apply
           them.

           -p num

               Number of directory levels to strip when applying (default=1)

           -R

               Apply patch in reverse.

           -P patch

               Patch filename to use inside quilt. This option can only be
               used when importing a single patch.

           -f  Overwrite/update existing patches.

           -d {o|a|n}

               When overwriting in existing patch, keep the old (o), all
               (a), or new (n) patch header. If both patches include
               headers, this option must be specified. This option is only
               effective when -f is used.

       <b>mail </b>{--mbox file|--send} [-m text] [-M file] [--prefix prefix]
       [--sender ...] [--from ...] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--bcc ...]
       [--subject ...] [--reply-to message] [--charset ...] [--signature
       file] [first_patch [last_patch]]

           Create mail messages from a specified range of patches, or all
           patches in the series file, and either store them in a mailbox
           file, or send them immediately. The editor is opened with a
           template for the introduction.  Please see
           /usr/local/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL for details.  When
           specifying a range of patches, a first patch name of `-' denotes
           the first, and a last patch name of `-' denotes the last patch in
           the series.

           -m text

               Text to use as the text in the introduction. When this option
               is used, the editor will not be invoked, and the patches will
               be processed immediately.

           -M file

               Like the -m option, but read the introduction from file.

           --prefix prefix

               Use an alternate prefix in the bracketed part of the subjects
               generated. Defaults to `patch'.

           --mbox file

               Store all messages in the specified file in mbox format. The
               mbox can later be sent using formail, for example.

           --send

               Send the messages directly.

           --sender

               The envelope sender address to use. The address must be of
               the form `user@domain.name'. No display name is allowed.

           --from, --subject

               The values for the From and Subject headers to use. If no
               --from option is given, the value of the --sender option is
               used.

           --to, --cc, --bcc

               Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.

           --charset

               Specify a particular message encoding on systems which don't
               use UTF-8 or ISO-8859-15. This character encoding must match
               the one used in the patches.

           --signature file

               Append the specified signature to messages (defaults to
               ~/.signature if found; use `-' for no signature).

           --reply-to message

               Add the appropriate headers to reply to the specified
               message.

       <b>new </b>[-p n|-p ab] {patchname}

           Create a new patch with the specified file name, and insert it
           after the topmost patch. The name can be prefixed with a sub-
           directory name, allowing for grouping related patches together.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
               original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

               Quilt can be used in sub-directories of a source tree. It
               determines the root of a source tree by searching for a
               patches directory above the current working directory. Create
               a patches directory in the intended root directory if quilt
               chooses a top-level directory that is too high up in the
               directory tree.

       <b>next </b>[patch]

           Print the name of the next patch after the specified or topmost
           patch in the series file.

       <b>patches </b>[-v] [--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]

           Print the list of patches that modify any of the specified files.
           (Uses a heuristic to determine which files are modified by
           unapplied patches.  Note that this heuristic is much slower than
           scanning applied patches.)

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is
               a tty).

       <b>pop </b>[-afRqv] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied patches.  Without
           options, the topmost patch is removed.  When a number is
           specified, remove the specified number of patches.  When a patch
           name is specified, remove patches until the specified patch end
           up on top of the stack.  Patch names may include the patches/
           prefix, which means that filename completion can be used.

           -a  Remove all applied patches.

           -f  Force remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied
               will be restored from backup files.

           -R  Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on
               timestamp checks.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch before it gets unapplied.

       <b>previous </b>[patch]

           Print the name of the previous patch before the specified or
           topmost patch in the series file.

       <b>push </b>[-afqvm] [--fuzz=N] [--merge[=merge|diff3]] [--leave-rejects]
       [--color[=always|auto|never]] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Apply patch(es) from the series file.  Without options, the next
           patch in the series file is applied.  When a number is specified,
           apply the specified number of patches.  When a patch name is
           specified, apply all patches up to and including the specified
           patch.  Patch names may include the patches/ prefix, which means
           that filename completion can be used.

           -a  Apply all patches in the series file.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (default: 2).

           -m, --merge[=merge|diff3]

               Merge the patch file into the original files (see patch(1)).

           --leave-rejects

               Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the
               patch is not actually applied.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is
               a tty).

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch after it was successfully
               applied.

       <b>refresh </b>[-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [-z[new_name]] [-f] [--no-
       timestamps] [--no-index] [--diffstat] [--sort] [--backup] [--strip-
       trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Refreshes the specified patch, or the topmost patch by default.
           Documentation that comes before the actual patch in the patch
           file is retained.

           It is possible to refresh patches that are not on top.  If any
           patches on top of the patch to refresh modify the same files, the
           script aborts by default.  Patches can still be refreshed with
           -f.  In that case this script will print a warning for each
           shadowed file, changes by more recent patches will be ignored,
           and only changes in files that have not been modified by any more
           recent patches will end up in the specified patch.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
               original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context.
               Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The
               number of context lines defaults to 3.

           -z[new_name]

               Create a new patch containing the changes instead of
               refreshing the topmost patch. If no new name is specified,
               `-2' is added to the original patch name, etc. (See the fork
               command.)

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           --diffstat

               Add a diffstat section to the patch header, or replace the
               existing diffstat section.

           -f  Enforce refreshing of a patch that is not on top.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original
               order.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

       <b>remove </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Remove one or more files from the topmost or named patch.  Files
           that are modified by patches on top of the specified patch cannot
           be removed.

           -P patch

               Remove named files from the named patch.

       <b>rename </b>[-P patch] new_name

           Rename the topmost or named patch.

           -P patch

               Patch to rename.

       <b>revert </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Revert uncommitted changes to the topmost or named patch for the
           specified file(s): after the revert, 'quilt diff -z' will show no
           differences for those files. Changes to files that are modified
           by patches on top of the specified patch cannot be reverted.

           -P patch

               Revert changes in the named patch.

       <b>series </b>[--color[=always|auto|never]] [-v]

           Print the names of all patches in the series file.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is
               a tty).

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

       <b>setup </b>[-d path-prefix] [-v] [--sourcedir dir] [--fuzz=N]
       [--slow|--fast] {specfile|seriesfile}

           Initializes a source tree from an rpm spec file or a quilt series
           file.

           -d  Optional path prefix for the resulting source tree.

           --sourcedir

               Directory that contains the package sources. Defaults to `.'.

           -v  Verbose debug output.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (needs rpm 4.6 or later).

           --slow
               Use the original, slow method to process the spec file. This
               is the default for now, but that might change in the future.
               In this mode, rpmbuild generates a working tree in a
               temporary directory while all its actions are recorded, and
               then everything is replayed from scratch in the target
               directory.

           --fast
               Use an alternative, faster method to process the spec file.
               In this mode, rpmbuild is told to generate a working tree
               directly in the target directory. If the input is a series
               file, it is assumed that all archives have been extracted
               manually beforehand.

       <b>snapshot </b>[-d]

           Take a snapshot of the current working state.  After taking the
           snapshot, the tree can be modified in the usual ways, including
           pushing and popping patches.  A diff against the tree at the
           moment of the snapshot can be generated with `quilt diff
           --snapshot'.

           -d  Only remove current snapshot.

       <b>top</b>

           Print the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of
           applied patches.

       <b>unapplied </b>[patch]

           Print a list of patches that are not applied, or all patches that
           follow the specified patch in the series file.

       <b>upgrade</b>

           Upgrade the meta-data in a working tree from an old version of
           quilt to the current version. This command is only needed when
           the quilt meta-data format has changed, and the working tree
           still contains old-format meta-data. In that case, quilt will
           request to run `quilt upgrade'.

       <b>--trace</b>

               Runs the command in bash trace mode (-x). For internal

       <b>--quiltrc </b>file

               Use the specified configuration file instead of ~/.quiltrc

               the pdf documentation for details about its possible
               contents.  The special value "-" causes quilt not to read any
               configuration file.

       The exit status is 0 if the sub-command was successfully executed,
       and 1 in case of error.

       An exit status of 2 denotes that quilt did not do anything to
       complete the command.  This happens in particular when asking to push
       when the whole stack is already pushed, or asking to pop when the
       whole stack is already popped.  This behavior is intended to ease the
       scripting around quilt.

       The patches/ directory is precious as it contains all your patches as
       well as the order in which it should be applied.

       The .pc/ directory contains some metadata about the current state of
       your patch serie. Changing its content is not advised. This directory
       can usually be regenerated from the initial files and the content of
       the patches/ directory (provided that all patches were regenerated
       before the removal).

       Upon startup, quilt evaluates the file .quiltrc in the user's home
       directory, or the file specified with the --quiltrc option.  This
       file is a regular bash script. Default options can be passed to any
       COMMAND by defining a QUILT_${COMMAND}_ARGS variable.  For example,
       QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto" causes the output of quilt diff to be
       syntax colored when writing to a terminal.

       In addition to that, quilt recognizes the following variables:

       EDITOR

           The program to run to edit files.  If it isn't redefined in the
           configuration file, $EDITOR as defined in the environment will be
           used.

       LESS

           The arguments used to invoke the pager.  Inherits the existing
           value of $LESS if LESS is already set in the environment,
           otherwise defaults to "-FRSX".

       QUILT_DIFF_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU diff when
           generating patches. A useful setting for C source code is "-p",
           which causes GNU diff to show in the resulting patch which
           function a change is in.

       QUILT_PATCH_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to GNU patch when
           applying patches.  For example, recent versions of GNU patch
           support the "--reject-format=unified" option for generating
           reject files in unified diff style (older patch versions used
           "--unified-reject-files" for that).

           You may also want to add the "-E" option if you have issues with
           quilt not deleting empty files when you think it should. The
           documentation of GNU patch says that "normally this option is
           unnecessary", but when patch is in POSIX mode or if the patch
           format doesn't allow to distinguish empty files from deleted
           files, patch deletes empty files only if the -E option is given.
           Beware that when passing -E to patch, quilt will no longer be
           able to deal with empty files, which is why using -E is no longer
           the default.

       QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS

           Additional options that quilt shall pass to diffstat when
           generating patch statistics. For example, "-f0" can be used for
           an alternative output format. Recent versions of diffstat also
           support alternative rounding methods ("-r1", "-r2").

       QUILT_PATCHES

           The location of patch files, defaulting to "patches".

       QUILT_SERIES

           The name of the series file, defaulting to "series". Unless an
           absolute path is used, the search algorithm described above
           applies.

       QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX

           If set to anything, quilt will prefix patch names it prints with
           their directory (QUILT_PATCHES).

       QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX

           By default, quilt prepends an Index: line to the patches it
           generates.  If this variable is set to anything, no line is
           prepended.  This is a shortcut to adding --no-index to both
           QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

       QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS

           By default, quilt includes timestamps in headers when generating
           patches.  If this variable is set to anything, no timestamp will
           be included.  This is a shortcut to adding --no-timestamps to
           both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.

       QUILT_PAGER

           The pager quilt shall use for commands which produce paginated
           output. If unset, the values of GIT_PAGER or PAGER is used.  If
           none of these variables is set, "less -R" is used.  An empty
           value indicates that no pager should be used.

       QUILT_COLORS

           By default, quilt uses its predefined color set in order to be
           more comprehensible when distiguishing various types of patches,
           eg.  applied/unapplied, failed, etc.

           To override one or more color settings, set the QUILT_COLORS
           variable in following syntax - colon (:) separated list of
           elements, each being of the form &lt;format name&gt;=&lt;foreground
           color&gt;[;&lt;background color&gt;]

           Format names with their respective default values are listed
           below, along with their usage(s).  Color codes(values) are
           standard bash coloring escape codes.  See more at
           <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html#AEN20229">http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html#AEN20229</a>

           <b>diff_hdr  </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color the index line. Defaults
                     to 32 (green).

           <b>diff_add  </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color added lines. Defaults to
                     36 (azure).

           <b>diff_mod  </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color modified lines. Defaults
                     to 35 (purple).

           <b>diff_rem  </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color removed lines. Defaults
                     to 35 (purple).

           <b>diff_hunk </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color hunk header. Defaults to
                     33 (brown/orange).

           <b>diff_ctx  </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color the text after end of
                     hunk header (diff --show-c-function generates this).
                     Defaults to 35 (purple).

           <b>diff_cctx </b>Used in 'quilt diff' to color the 15-asterisk sequence
                     before or after a hunk. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

           <b>patch_fuzz</b>
                     Used in 'quilt push' to color the patch fuzz
                     information. Defaults to 35 (purple).

           <b>patch_fail</b>
                     Used in 'quilt push' to color the fail message.
                     Defaults to 31 (red).

           <b>series_app</b>
                     Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color the
                     applied patch names. Defaults to 32 (green).

           <b>series_top</b>
                     Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color the
                     top patch name. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).

           <b>series_una</b>
                     Used in 'quilt series' and 'quilt patches' to color
                     unapplied patch names. Defaults to 0 (no special
                     color).

           In addition, the <b>clear </b>format name is used to turn off special
           coloring. Its value is 0; it is not advised to modify it.

           The content of QUILT_COLORS supersedes default values. So the
           value diff_hdr=35;44 will get you the diff headers in magenta
           over blue instead of the default green over unchanged background.
           For that, add the following content to ~/.quiltrc (or

       Quilt started as a series of scripts written by Andrew Morton (patch-
       scripts). Based on Andrew's ideas, Andreas Gruenbacher completely
       rewrote the scripts, with the help of several other contributors (see
       AUTHORS file in the distribution).

       This man page was written by Martin Quinson, based on information
       found in the pdf documentation, and in the help messages of each
       commands.
