       <b>−z </b><i>string</i> True if the length of string <i>string</i> is zero; otherwise,

       <i>string</i>    True if the string <i>string</i> is not the null string;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>s1</i> <b>= </b><i>s2</i>   True if the strings <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are identical; otherwise,
                 false.

       <i>s1</i> <b>!= </b><i>s2</i>  True if the strings <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are not identical; otherwise,
                 false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−eq </b><i>n2</i> True if the integers <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> are algebraically equal;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−ne </b><i>n2</i> True if the integers <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> are not algebraically equal;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−gt </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically greater than the
                 integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−ge </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically greater than or
                 equal to the integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−lt </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically less than the
                 integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>−le </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically less than or equal
                 to the integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>−a </b><i>expression2</i>
                 True if both <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are true;
                 otherwise, false. The <b>−a </b>binary primary is left
                 associative. It has a higher precedence than <b>−o</b>.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>−o </b><i>expression2</i>
                 True if either <i>expression1</i> or <i>expression2</i> is true;
                 otherwise, false. The <b>−o </b>binary primary is left
                 associative.

       With the exception of the <b>−h </b><i>pathname</i> and <b>−L </b><i>pathname</i> primaries, if a
       <i>pathname</i> argument is a symbolic link, <i>test</i> shall evaluate the
       expression by resolving the symbolic link and using the file
       referenced by the link.

       These primaries can be combined with the following operators:

       <b>! </b><i>expression</i>
                 True if <i>expression</i> is false. False if <i>expression</i> is true.

       <b>( </b><i>expression</i> <b>)</b>
                 True if <i>expression</i> is true. False if <i>expression</i> is false.
                 The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence
                 and associativity.

       The primaries with two elements of the form:

           <b>−</b><i>primary_operator primary_operand</i>

       are known as <i>unary primaries</i>.  The primaries with three elements in
       either of the two forms:

           <i>primary_operand</i> −<i>primary_operator primary_operand</i>

           primary_operand primary_operator primary_operand

       are known as <i>binary primaries</i>.  Additional implementation-defined
       operators and <i>primary_operator</i>s may be provided by implementations.
       They shall be of the form −<i>operator</i> where the first character of
       <i>operator</i> is not a digit.

       The algorithm for determining the precedence of the operators and the
       return value that shall be generated is based on the number of
       arguments presented to <i>test</i>.  (However, when using the <b>"[...]" </b>form,
       the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; final argument shall not be counted in
       this algorithm.)

       In the following list, $1, $2, $3, and $4 represent the arguments
       presented to <i>test</i>:

       0 arguments:
                   Exit false (1).

       1 argument: Exit true (0) if $1 is not null; otherwise, exit false.

       2 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, exit true if $2 is null, false if $2 is
                       not null.

                    *  If $1 is a unary primary, exit true if the unary test
                       is true, false if the unary test is false.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       3 arguments:
                    *  If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary test of
                       $1 and $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the two-argument test of $2 and
                       $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $3 is <b>')'</b>, perform the unary test of
                       $2.  On systems that do not support the XSI option,
                       the results are unspecified if $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $3 is
                       <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       4 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the three-argument test of $2,
                       $3, and $4.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $4 is <b>')'</b>, perform the two-argument
                       test of $2 and $3.  On systems that do not support
                       the XSI option, the results are unspecified if $1 is
                       <b>'(' </b>and $4 is <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

       &gt;4 arguments:
                   The results are unspecified.

                   On XSI-conformant systems, combinations of primaries and
                   operators shall be evaluated using the precedence and
                   associativity rules described previously. In addition,
                   the string comparison binary primaries <b>'=' </b>and <b>"!=" </b>shall
                   have a higher precedence than any unary primary.

       <i>test</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 8.2</i>, <i>Internationalization</i>
                 <i>Variables</i> for the precedence of internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale
                 categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of

       The XSI extensions specifying the <b>−a </b>and <b>−o </b>binary primaries and the
       <b>'(' </b>and <b>')' </b>operators have been marked obsolescent. (Many expressions
       using them are ambiguously defined by the grammar depending on the
       specific expressions being evaluated.) Scripts using these
       expressions should be converted to the forms given below. Even though
       many implementations will continue to support these obsolescent
       forms, scripts should be extremely careful when dealing with user-
       supplied input that could be confused with these and other primaries
       and operators. Unless the application developer knows all the cases
       that produce input to the script, invocations like:

           <b>test "$1" −a "$2"</b>

       should be written as:

           <b>test "$1" &amp;&amp; test "$2"</b>

       to avoid problems if a user supplied values such as $1 set to <b>'!'</b>
       and $2 set to the null string. That is, in cases where maximal
       portability is of concern, replace:

           <b>test expr1 −a expr2</b>

       with:

           <b>test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2</b>

       and replace:

           <b>test expr1 −o expr2</b>

       with:

           <b>test expr1 || test expr2</b>

       but note that, in <i>test</i>, <b>−a </b>has higher precedence than <b>−o </b>while <b>"&amp;&amp;"</b>
       and <b>"||" </b>have equal precedence in the shell.

       Parentheses or braces can be used in the shell command language to
       effect grouping.

       Parentheses must be escaped when using <i>sh</i>; for example:

           <b>test \( expr1 −a expr2 \) −o expr3</b>

       This command is not always portable even on XSI-conformant systems
       depending on the expressions specified by <i>expr</i>1, <i>expr</i>2, and <i>expr</i>3.
       The following form can be used instead:

           <b>( test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2 ) || test expr3</b>

       The two commands:

           <b>test "$1"</b>
           <b>test ! "$1"</b>

       could not be used reliably on some historical systems. Unexpected
       results would occur if such a <i>string</i> expression were used and $1
       expanded to <b>'!'</b>, <b>'('</b>, or a known unary primary. Better constructs
       are:

           <b>test −n "$1"</b>
           <b>test −z "$1"</b>

       respectively.

       Historical systems have also been unreliable given the common
       construct:

           <b>test "$response" = "expected string"</b>

       One of the following is a more reliable form:

           <b>test "X$response" = "Xexpected string"</b>
           <b>test "expected string" = "$response"</b>

       Note that the second form assumes that <i>expected string</i> could not be
       confused with any unary primary. If <i>expected string</i> starts with <b>'−'</b>,
       <b>'('</b>, <b>'!'</b>, or even <b>'='</b>, the first form should be used instead. Using
       the preceding rules without the XSI marked extensions, any of the
       three comparison forms is reliable, given any input. (However, note
       that the strings are quoted in all cases.)

       Because the string comparison binary primaries, <b>'=' </b>and <b>"!="</b>, have a
       higher precedence than any unary primary in the greater than 4
       argument case, unexpected results can occur if arguments are not
       properly prepared. For example, in:

           <b>test −d $1 −o −d $2</b>

       If $1 evaluates to a possible directory name of <b>'='</b>, the first three
       arguments are considered a string comparison, which shall cause a
       syntax error when the second <b>−d </b>is encountered. One of the following
       forms prevents this; the second is preferred:

           <b>test \( −d "$1" \) −o \( −d "$2" \)</b>
           <b>test −d "$1" || test −d "$2"</b>

       Also in the greater than 4 argument case:

           <b>test "$1" = "bat" −a "$2" = "ball"</b>

       syntax errors occur if $1 evaluates to <b>'(' </b>or <b>'!'</b>.  One of the
       following forms prevents this; the third is preferred:

           <b>test "X$1" = "Xbat" −a "X$2" = "Xball"</b>
           <b>test "$1" = "bat" &amp;&amp; test "$2" = "ball"</b>
           <b>test "X$1" = "Xbat" &amp;&amp; test "X$2" = "Xball"</b>

<h2><a id="RATIONALE" href="#RATIONALE"></a>RATIONALE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The KornShell-derived conditional command (double bracket <b>[[]]</b>) was
       removed from the shell command language description in an early
       proposal. Objections were raised that the real problem is misuse of
       the <i>test</i> command (<b>[</b>), and putting it into the shell is the wrong way
       to fix the problem.  Instead, proper documentation and a new shell
       reserved word (<b>!</b>)  are sufficient.

       Tests that require multiple <i>test</i> operations can be done at the shell
       level using individual invocations of the <i>test</i> command and shell
       logicals, rather than using the error-prone <b>−o </b>flag of <i>test</i>.

       XSI-conformant systems support more than four arguments.

       XSI-conformant systems support the combining of primaries with the
       following constructs:

       <i>expression1</i> <b>−a </b><i>expression2</i>
             True if both <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are true.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>−o </b><i>expression2</i>
             True if at least one of <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are true.

       <b>( </b><i>expression</i> <b>)</b>
             True if <i>expression</i> is true.

       In evaluating these more complex combined expressions, the following
       precedence rules are used:

        *  The unary primaries have higher precedence than the algebraic
           binary primaries.

        *  The unary primaries have lower precedence than the string binary
           primaries.

        *  The unary and binary primaries have higher precedence than the
           unary <i>string</i> primary.

        *  The <b>!  </b>operator has higher precedence than the <b>−a </b>operator, and
           the <b>−a </b>operator has higher precedence than the <b>−o </b>operator.

        *  The <b>−a </b>and <b>−o </b>operators are left associative.

        *  The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence and
           associativity.

       The BSD and System V versions of <b>−f </b>are not the same. The BSD
       definition was:

       <b>−f </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> exists and is not a directory.

       The SVID version (true if the file exists and is a regular file) was
       chosen for this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 because its use is consistent
       with the <b>−b</b>, <b>−c</b>, <b>−d</b>, and <b>−p </b>operands (<i>file</i> exists and is a specific
       file type).

       The <b>−e </b>primary, possessing similar functionality to that provided by
       the C shell, was added because it provides the only way for a shell
       script to find out if a file exists without trying to open the file.
       Since implementations are allowed to add additional file types, a
       portable script cannot use:

           <b>test −b foo −o −c foo −o −d foo −o −f foo −o −p foo</b>

       to find out if <b>foo </b>is an existing file. On historical BSD systems,
       the existence of a file could be determined by:

           <b>test −f foo −o −d foo</b>

       but there was no easy way to determine that an existing file was a
       regular file. An early proposal used the KornShell <b>−a </b>primary (with
       the same meaning), but this was changed to <b>−e </b>because there were
       concerns about the high probability of humans confusing the <b>−a</b>
       primary with the <b>−a </b>binary operator.

       The following options were not included in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, although they are provided by some implementations.
       These operands should not be used by new implementations for other
       purposes:

       <b>−k </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> exists and its sticky bit is set.

       <b>−C </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> is a contiguous file.

       <b>−V </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> is a version file.

       The following option was not included because it was undocumented in
       most implementations, has been removed from some implementations
       (including System V), and the functionality is provided by the shell
       (see <i>Section 2.6.2</i>, <i>Parameter Expansion</i>.

       <b>−l </b><i>string</i> The length of the string <i>string</i>.

       The <b>−b</b>, <b>−c</b>, <b>−g</b>, <b>−p</b>, <b>−u</b>, and <b>−x </b>operands are derived from the SVID;
       historical BSD does not provide them. The <b>−k </b>operand is derived from
       System V; historical BSD does not provide it.

       On historical BSD systems, <i>test</i> <b>−w </b><i>directory</i> always returned false
       because <i>test</i> tried to open the directory for writing, which always
       fails.

       Some additional primaries newly invented or from the KornShell
       appeared in an early proposal as part of the conditional command
       (<b>[[]]</b>): <i>s1</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>s2</i>, <i>s1</i> <b>&lt; </b><i>s2</i>, <i>str</i> <b>= </b><i>pattern</i>, <i>str</i> <b>!= </b><i>pattern</i>, <i>f1</i> <b>−nt </b><i>f2</i>,
       <i>f1</i> <b>−ot </b><i>f2</i>, and <i>f1</i> <b>−ef </b><i>f2</i>.  They were not carried forward into the
       <i>test</i> utility when the conditional command was removed from the shell
       because they have not been included in the <i>test</i> utility built into
       historical implementations of the <i>sh</i> utility.

       The <b>−t </b><i>file_descriptor</i> primary is shown with a mandatory argument
       because the grammar is ambiguous if it can be omitted. Historical
       implementations have allowed it to be omitted, providing a default of
       1.

       It is noted that <b>'[' </b>is not part of the portable filename character
       set; however, since it is required to be encoded by a single byte,
       and is part of the portable character set, the name of this utility
       forms a character string across all supported locales.
