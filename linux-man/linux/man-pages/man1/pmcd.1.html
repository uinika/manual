       <b>pmcd </b>is the collector used by the Performance Co-Pilot (see
       <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) to gather performance metrics on a system.  As a rule,
       there must be an instance of <b>pmcd </b>running on a system for any
       performance metrics to be available to the PCP.

       <b>pmcd </b>accepts connections from client applications running either on
       the same machine or remotely and provides them with metrics and other
       related information from the machine that <b>pmcd </b>is executing on.  <b>pmcd</b>
       delegates most of this request servicing to a collection of
       Performance Metrics Domain Agents (or just agents), where each agent
       is responsible for a particular group of metrics, known as the domain
       of the agent.  For example the <b>postgresql </b>agent is responsible for
       reporting information relating to the PostgreSQL database, such as
       the transaction and query counts, indexing and replication
       statistics, and so on.

       The agents may be processes started by <b>pmcd</b>, independent processes or
       Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs, see <a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a>) attached to <b>pmcd</b>'s
       address space.  The configuration section below describes how
       connections to agents are specified.

       The options to <b>pmcd </b>are as follows.

       <b>-A     </b>Disable service advertisement.  By default, <b>pmcd </b>will
              advertise its presence on the network using any available
              mechanisms (such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote monitoring
              tools with finding it.  These mechanisms are disabled with
              this option.

       <b>-c </b><i>config</i>
              On startup <b>pmcd </b>uses a configuration file from either the
              <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>, configuration variable in <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i>,
              or an environment variable of the same name.  However, these
              values may be overridden with <i>config</i> using this option.  The
              format of this configuration file is described below.

       <b>-C </b><i>dirname</i>
              Specify the path to the Network Security Services certificate
              database, for (optional) secure connections.  The default is
              <b>/etc/pki/nssdb</b>.  Refer also to the <b>-P </b>option.  If it does not
              already exist, this database can be created using the <b>certutil</b>
              utility.  This process and other certificate database
              maintenance information is provided in the <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> manual
              page and the online PCP tutorials.

       <b>-f     </b>By default <b>pmcd </b>is started as a daemon.  The <b>-f </b>option
              indicates that it should run in the foreground.  This is most
              useful when trying to diagnose problems with misbehaving
              agents.

       <b>-H </b><i>hostname</i>
              This option can be used to set the hostname that <b>pmcd </b>will use
              to represent this instance of itself.  This is used by client
              tools like <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> when reporting on the (possibly remote)
              host.  If this option is not set, the pmcd.hostname metric
              will match that returned by <a href="pmhostname.1.html">pmhostname(1)</a>.  Refer to the
              manual page for that tool for full details on how the hostname
              is evaluated.

       <b>-i </b><i>ipaddress</i>
              This option is usually only used on hosts with more than one
              network interface.  If no <b>-i </b>options are specified <b>pmcd</b>
              accepts connections made to any of its host's IP (Internet
              Protocol) addresses.  The <b>-i </b>option is used to specify
              explicitly an IP address that connections should be accepted
              on.  <i>ipaddress</i> should be in the standard dotted form (e.g.
              100.23.45.6).  The <b>-i </b>option may be used multiple times to
              define a list of IP addresses.  Connections made to any other
              IP addresses the host has will be refused.  This can be used
              to limit connections to one network interface if the host is a
              network gateway.  It is also useful if the host takes over the
              IP address of another host that has failed.  In such a
              situation only the standard IP addresses of the host should be
              given (not the ones inherited from the failed host).  This
              allows PCP applications to determine that a host has failed,
              rather than connecting to the host that has assumed the
              identity of the failed host.

       <b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>
              By default a log file named <i>pmcd.log</i> is written in the
              directory <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  The <b>-l </b>option causes the log
              file to be written to <i>logfile</i> instead of the default.  If the
              log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
              written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-L </b><i>bytes</i>
              <i>PDU</i>s received by <b>pmcd </b>from monitoring clients are restricted
              to a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to defend against
              Denial of Service attacks.  The <b>-L </b>option may be used to
              change the maximum incoming <i>PDU</i> size.

       <b>-M </b><i>certname</i>
              By default, pmcd will try to use a certificate called <b>PCP</b>
              <b>Collector certificate .  </b>The <b>-M </b>option allows this to be
              changed.

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>
              Normally <b>pmcd </b>loads the default Performance Metrics Name Space
              (PMNS) from <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</b>, however if the <b>-n </b>option
              is specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file
              <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-N </b><i>pmnsfile</i>
              Same function as <b>-n</b>, except for the handling of duplicate
              Performance Metric Identifiers (PMIDs) in <i>pmnsfile</i> - duplicate
              names are allowed with <b>-n </b>they are not allowed with <b>-N</b>.

       <b>-P </b><i>passfile</i>
              Specify the path to a file containing the Network Security
              Services certificate database password for (optional) secure
              connections, and for databases that are password protected.
              Refer also to the <b>-C </b>option.  When using this option, great
              care should be exercised to ensure appropriate ownership
              ("pcp" user, typically) and permissions on this file (0400, so
              as to be unreadable by any user other than the user running
              the <b>pmcd </b>process).

       <b>-q </b><i>timeout</i>
              The pmcd to agent version exchange protocol (new in PCP 2.0 -
              introduced to provide backward compatibility) uses this
              timeout to specify how long pmcd should wait before assuming
              that no version response is coming from an agent.  If this
              timeout is reached, the agent is assumed to be an agent which
              does not understand the PCP 2.0 protocol.  The default timeout
              interval is five seconds, but the <b>-q </b>option allows an
              alternative timeout interval (which must be greater than zero)
              to be specified.  The unit of time is seconds.

       <b>-Q     </b>Require that all remote client connections provide a
              certficate.

       <b>-S     </b>Require that all client connections provide user credentials.
              This means that only unix domain sockets, or authenticated
              connections are permitted (requires secure sockets support).
              If any user or group access control requirements are specified
              in the pmcd configuration file, then this mode of operation is
              automatically entered, whether the <b>-S </b>flag is specified or
              not.

       <b>-s </b><i>sockname</i>
              Specify the path to a local unix domain socket (for platforms
              supporting this socket family only).  The default value is
              <i>$PCP_RUN_DIR/pmcd.socket</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>timeout</i>
              To prevent misbehaving clients or agents from hanging the
              entire Performance Metrics Collection System (PMCS), <b>pmcd </b>uses
              timeouts on PDU exchanges with clients and agents running as
              processes.  By default the timeout interval is five seconds.
              The <b>-t </b>option allows an alternative timeout interval in
              seconds to be specified.  If <i>timeout</i> is zero, timeouts are
              turned off.  It is almost impossible to use the debugger
              interactively on an agent unless timeouts have been turned off
              for its "parent" <b>pmcd</b>.

              Once <b>pmcd </b>is running, the timeout may be dynamically modified
              by storing an integer value (the timeout in seconds) into the
              metric <b>pmcd.control.timeout </b>via <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a>.

       <b>-T </b><i>traceflag</i>
              To assist with error diagnosis for agents and/or clients of
              <b>pmcd </b>that are not behaving correctly, an internal event
              tracing mechanism is supported within <b>pmcd</b>.  The value of
              <i>traceflag</i> is interpreted as a bit field with the following
              control functions:

              <b>1   </b>enable client connection tracing
              <b>2   </b>enable PDU tracing
              <b>256 </b>unbuffered event tracing

              By default, event tracing is buffered using a circular buffer
              that is over-written as new events are recorded.  The default
              buffer size holds the last 20 events, although this number may
              be over-ridden by using <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to modify the metric
              <b>pmcd.control.tracebufs</b>.

              Similarly once <b>pmcd </b>is running, the event tracing control may
              be dynamically modified by storing 1 (enable) or 0 (disable)
              into the metrics <b>pmcd.control.traceconn</b>, <b>pmcd.control.tracepdu</b>
              and <b>pmcd.control.tracenobuf</b>.  These metrics map to the bit
              fields associated with the <i>traceflag</i> argument for the <b>-T</b>
              option.

              When operating in buffered mode, the event trace buffer will
              be dumped whenever an agent connection is terminated by <b>pmcd</b>,
              or when any value is stored into the metric
              <b>pmcd.control.dumptrace </b>via <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a>.

              In unbuffered mode, <b>every </b>event will be reported when it
              occurs.

       <b>-U </b><i>username</i>
              User account under which to run <b>pmcd</b>.  The default is the
              unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
              older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
              default.

       <b>-v     </b>Verify the <b>pmcd </b>configuration file, reporting on any errors
              then exiting with a status indicating verification success or
              failure.

       <b>-x </b><i>file</i>
              Before the <b>pmcd </b><i>logfile</i> can be opened, <b>pmcd </b>may encounter a
              fatal error which prevents it from starting.  By default, the
              output describing this error is sent to <b>/dev/tty </b>but it may
              redirected to <i>file</i>.

       If a PDU exchange with an agent times out, the agent has violated the
       requirement that it delivers metrics with little or no delay.  This
       is deemed a protocol failure and the agent is disconnected from <b>pmcd</b>.
       Any subsequent requests for information from the agent will fail with
       a status indicating that there is no agent to provide it.

       It is possible to specify access control to <b>pmcd </b>based on users,
       groups and hosts.  This allows one to prevent users, groups of users,
       and certain hosts from accessing the metrics provided by <b>pmcd </b>and is
       described in more detail in the Section on ACCESS CONTROL below.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION" href="#CONFIGURATION"></a>CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       On startup <b>pmcd </b>looks for a configuration file named
       <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.  This file specifies which agents cover which
       performance metrics domains and how <b>pmcd </b>should make contact with the
       agents.  An optional section specifying access controls may follow
       the agent configuration data.

       <b>Warning</b>: <b>pmcd </b>is usually started as part of the boot sequence and
       runs initially as root.  The configuration file may contain shell
       commands to create agents, which will be executed by root.  To
       prevent security breaches the configuration file should be writable
       only by root.  The use of absolute path names is also recommended.

       The case of the reserved words in the configuration file is
       unimportant, but elsewhere, the case is preserved.

       Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the
       configuration file.  A comment begins with a ``#'' character and
       finishes at the end of the line.  A line may be continued by ensuring
       that the last character on the line is a ``\'' (backslash).  A
       comment on a continued line ends at the end of the continued line.
       Spaces may be included in lexical elements by enclosing the entire
       element in double quotes.  A double quote preceded by a backslash is
       always a literal double quote.  A ``#'' in double quotes or preceded
       by a backslash is treated literally rather than as a comment
       delimiter.  Lexical elements and separators are described further in
       the following sections.
</pre>
<h2><a id="AGENT_CONFIGURATION" href="#AGENT_CONFIGURATION"></a>AGENT CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Each line of the agent configuration section of the configuration
       file contains details of how to connect <b>pmcd </b>to one of its agents and
       specifies which metrics domain the agent deals with.  An agent may be
       attached as a DSO, or via a socket, or a pair of pipes.

       Each line of the agent configuration section of the configuration
       file must be either an agent specification, a comment, or a blank
       line.  Lexical elements are separated by whitespace characters,
       however a single agent specification may not be broken across lines
       unless a <b>\ </b>(backslash) is used to continue the line.

       Each agent specification must start with a textual label (string)
       followed by an integer in the range 1 to 510.  The label is a tag
       used to refer to the agent and the integer specifies the domain for
       which the agent supplies data.  This domain identifier corresponds to
       the domain portion of the PMIDs handled by the agent.  Each agent
       must have a unique label and domain identifier.

       For DSO agents a line of the form:

              <i>label domain-no</i> <b>dso </b><i>entry-point path</i>

       should appear.  Where,

       <i>label</i>         is a string identifying the agent
       <i>domain-no</i>     is an unsigned integer specifying the agent's domain in
                     the range 1 to 510
       <i>entry-point</i>   is the name of an initialization function which will be
                     called when the DSO is loaded
       <i>path</i>          designates the location of the DSO and this is expected
                     to be an absolute pathname.  <b>pmcd </b>is only able to load
                     DSO agents that have the same <i>simabi</i> (Subprogram
                     Interface Model ABI, or calling conventions) as it does
                     (i.e. only one of the <i>simabi</i> versions will be
                     applicable).  The <i>simabi</i> version of a running <b>pmcd </b>may
                     be determined by fetching <b>pmcd.simabi</b>.  Alternatively,
                     the <a href="file.1.html">file(1)</a> command may be used to determine the <i>simabi</i>
                     version from the <b>pmcd </b>executable.

                     For a relative <i>path</i> the environment variable <b>PMCD_PATH</b>
                     defines a colon (:) separated list of directories to
                     search when trying to locate the agent DSO.  The
                     default search path is <b>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib:/usr/pcp/lib</b>.

       For agents providing socket connections, a line of the form

              <i>label domain-no</i> <b>socket </b><i>addr-family address</i> [ <i>command</i> ]

       should appear.  Where,

       <i>label</i>         is a string identifying the agent
       <i>domain-no</i>     is an unsigned integer specifying the agent's domain in
                     the range 1 to 510
       <i>addr-family</i>   designates whether the socket is in the <b>AF_INET,</b>
                     <b>AF_INET6 </b>or <b>AF_UNIX </b>domain, and the corresponding
                     values for this parameter are <b>inet, ipv6 </b>and <b>unix</b>
                     respectively.
       <i>address</i>       specifies the address of the socket within the
                     previously specified <i>addr-family.</i>  For <b>unix </b>sockets,
                     the address should be the name of an agent's socket on
                     the local host (a valid address for the UNIX domain).
                     For <b>inet </b>and <b>ipv6 </b>sockets, the address may be either a
                     port number or a port name which may be used to connect
                     to an agent on the local host.  There is no syntax for
                     specifying an agent on a remote host as a <b>pmcd </b>deals
                     only with agents on the same machine.
       <i>command</i>       is an optional parameter used to specify a command line
                     to start the agent when <b>pmcd </b>initializes.  If <i>command</i>
                     is not present, <b>pmcd </b>assumes that the specified agent
                     has already been created.  The <i>command</i> is considered to
                     start from the first non-white character after the
                     socket address and finish at the next newline that
                     isn't preceded by a backslash.  After a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> the
                     <i>command</i> is passed unmodified to <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> to
                     instantiate the agent.

       For agents interacting with the <b>pmcd </b>via stdin/stdout, a line of the
       form:

              <i>label domain-no</i> <b>pipe </b><i>protocol command</i>

       should appear.  Where,

       <i>label</i>         is a string identifying the agent
       <i>domain-no</i>     is an unsigned integer specifying the agent's domain
       <i>protocol</i>      The value for this parameter should be <b>binary</b>.

                     Additionally, the <i>protocol</i> can include the <b>notready</b>
                     keyword to indicate that the agent must be marked as
                     not being ready to process requests from <b>pmcd</b>. The
                     agent will explicitly notify the <b>pmcd </b>when it is ready
                     to process the requests by sending <b>PM_ERR_PMDAREADY</b>
                     PDU.

       <i>command</i>       specifies a command line to start the agent when <b>pmcd</b>
                     initializes.  Note that <i>command</i> is mandatory for pipe-
                     based agents.  The <i>command</i> is considered to start from
                     the first non-white character after the <i>protocol</i>
                     parameter and finish at the next newline that isn't
                     preceded by a backslash.  After a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> the <i>command</i>
                     is passed unmodified to <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> to instantiate the
                     agent.

<h2><a id="ACCESS_CONTROL_CONFIGURATION" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL_CONFIGURATION"></a>ACCESS CONTROL CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The access control section of the configuration file is optional, but
       if present it must follow the agent configuration data.  The case of
       reserved words is ignored, but elsewhere case is preserved.  Lexical
       elements in the access control section are separated by whitespace or
       the special delimiter characters: square brackets (``['' and ``]''),
       braces (``{'' and ``}''), colon (``:''), semicolon (``;'') and comma
       (``,'').  The special characters are not treated as special in the
       agent configuration section.  Lexical elements may be quoted (double
       quotes) as necessary.

       The access control section of the file must start with a line of the
       form:

       <b>[access]</b>

       Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and within the
       brackets and the case of the <b>access </b>keyword is ignored.  No other
       text may appear on the line except a trailing comment.

       Following this line, the remainder of the configuration file should
       contain lines that allow or disallow operations from particular hosts
       or groups of hosts.

       There are two kinds of operations that occur via <b>pmcd</b>:

       <b>fetch          </b>allows retrieval of information from <b>pmcd</b>.  This may
                      be information about a metric (e.g. its description,
                      instance domain or help text) or a value for a metric.

       <b>store          </b>allows <b>pmcd </b>to be used to store metric values in
                      agents that permit store operations.  This may be the
                      actual value of the metric (e.g. resetting a counter
                      to zero).  Alternatively, it may be a value used by
                      the PMDA to introduce a change to some aspect of
                      monitoring of that metric (e.g. server side event
                      filtering) - possibly even only for the active client
                      tool performing the store operation, and not others.

       Access to <b>pmcd </b>can be granted in three ways - by user, group of
       users, or at a host level.  In the latter, all users on a host are
       granted the same level of access, unless the user or group access
       control mechanism is also in use.

       User names and group names will be verified using the local
       <b>/etc/passwd </b>and <b>/etc/groups </b>files (or an alternative directory
       service), using the <a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent(3)</a> routines.

       Hosts may be identified by name, IP address, IPv6 address or by the
       special host specifications ``"unix:"'' or ``"local:"''. ``"unix:"''
       refers to <b>pmcd's </b>unix domain socket, on supported platforms.
       ``"local:"'' is equivalent to specifying ``"unix:"'' and
       ``localhost``.

       Wildcards may also be specified by ending the host identifier with
       the single wildcard character ``*'' as the last-given component of an
       address. The wildcard ``".*"'' refers to all inet (IPv4) addresses.
       The wildcard ``":*"'' refers to all IPv6 addresses.  If an IPv6
       wildcard contains a ``::'' component, then the final ``*'' refers to
       the final 16 bits of the address only, otherwise it refers to the
       remaining unspecified bits of the address.

       The wildcard ``*'' refers to all users, groups or host addresses,
       including ``"unix:"''.  Names of users, groups or hosts may not be
       wildcarded.

       The following are all valid host identifiers:

            boing
            localhost
            giggle.melbourne.sgi.com
            129.127.112.2
            129.127.114.*
            129.*
            .*
            fe80::223:14ff:feaf:b62c
            fe80::223:14ff:feaf:*
            fe80:*
            :*
            "unix:"
            "local:"
            *

       The following are not valid host identifiers:

            *.melbourne
            129.127.*.*
            129.*.114.9
            129.127*
            fe80::223:14ff:*:*
            fe80::223:14ff:*:b62c
            fe80*

       The first example is not allowed because only (numeric) IP addresses
       may contain a wildcard.  The second and fifth examples are not valid
       because there is more than one wildcard character.  The third and
       sixth contain an embedded wildcard, the fourth and seventh have a
       wildcard character that is not the last component of the address (the
       last components are 127* and fe80* respectively).

       The name <b>localhost </b>is given special treatment to make the behavior of
       host wildcarding consistent.  Rather than being 127.0.0.1 and ::1, it
       is mapped to the primary inet and IPv6 addresses associated with the
       name of the host on which <b>pmcd </b>is running.  Beware of this when
       running <b>pmcd </b>on multi-homed hosts.

       Access for users, groups or hosts are allowed or disallowed by
       specifying statements of the form:

              <b>allow users </b><i>userlist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>
              <b>disallow users </b><i>userlist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>
              <b>allow groups </b><i>grouplist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>
              <b>disallow groups </b><i>grouplist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>
              <b>allow hosts </b><i>hostlist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>
              <b>disallow hosts </b><i>hostlist</i> <b>: </b><i>operations</i> <b>;</b>

       <i>list</i>          <i>userlist</i>, <i>grouplist</i> and <i>hostlist</i> are comma separated
                     lists of one or more users, groups or host identifiers.

       <i>operations</i>    is a comma separated list of the operation types
                     described above, <b>all </b>(which allows/disallows all
                     operations), or <b>all except </b><i>operations</i> (which
                     allows/disallows all operations except those listed).

       Either plural or singular forms of <b>users</b>, <b>groups</b>, and <b>hosts </b>keywords
       are allowed.  If this keyword is omitted, a default of <b>hosts </b>will be
       used.  This behaviour is for backward-compatibility only, it is
       preferable to be explicit.

       Where no specific <b>allow </b>or <b>disallow </b>statement applies to an
       operation, the default is to allow the operation from all users,
       groups and hosts.  In the trivial case when there is no access
       control section in the configuration file, all operations from all
       users, groups, and hosts are permitted.

       If a new connection to <b>pmcd </b>is attempted by a user, group or host
       that is not permitted to perform any operations, the connection will
       be closed immediately after an error response <b>PM_ERR_PERMISSION </b>has
       been sent to the client attempting the connection.

       Statements with the same level of wildcarding specifying identical
       hosts may not contradict each other.  For example if a host named
       <b>clank </b>had an IP address of 129.127.112.2, specifying the following
       two rules would be erroneous:

            allow host clank : fetch, store;
            disallow host 129.127.112.2 : all except fetch;

       because they both refer to the same host, but disagree as to whether
       the <b>fetch </b>operation is permitted from that host.

       Statements containing more specific host specifications override less
       specific ones according to the level of wildcarding.  For example a
       rule of the form

            allow host clank : all;

       overrides

            disallow host 129.127.112.* : all except fetch;

       because the former contains a specific host name (equivalent to a
       fully specified IP address), whereas the latter has a wildcard.  In
       turn, the latter would override

            disallow host * : all;

       It is possible to limit the number of connections from a user, group
       or host to <b>pmcd</b>.  This may be done by adding a clause of the form

              <b>maximum </b><i>n</i> <b>connections</b>

       to the <i>operations</i> list of an <b>allow </b>statement.  Such a clause may not
       be used in a <b>disallow </b>statement.  Here, <i>n</i> is the maximum number of
       connections that will be accepted from the user, group or host
       matching the identifier(s) used in the statement.

       An access control statement with a list of user, group or host
       identifiers is equivalent to a set of access control statements, with
       each specifying one of the identifiers in the list and all with the
       same access controls (both permissions and connection limits).  A
       group should be used if you want users to contribute to a shared
       connection limit.  A wildcard should be used if you want hosts to
       contribute to a shared connection limit.

       When a new client requests a connection, and <b>pmcd </b>has determined that
       the client has permission to connect, it searches the matching list
       of access control statements for the most specific match containing a
       connection limit.  For brevity, this will be called the limiting
       statement.  If there is no limiting statement, the client is granted
       a connection.  If there is a limiting statement and the number of
       <b>pmcd </b>clients with user ID, group ID, or IP addresses that match the
       identifier in the limiting statement is less than the connection
       limit in the statement, the connection is allowed.  Otherwise the
       connection limit has been reached and the client is refused a
       connection.

       Group access controls and the wildcarding in host identifiers means
       that once <b>pmcd </b>actually accepts a connection from a client, the
       connection may contribute to the current connection count of more
       than one access control statement - the client's host may match more
       than one access control statement, and similarly the user ID may be
       in more than one group.  This may be significant for subsequent
       connection requests.

       Note that <b>pmcd </b>enters a mode where it runs effectively with a higher-
       level of security as soon as a user or group access control section
       is added to the configuration.  In this mode only authenticated
       connections are allowed - either from a SASL authenticated
       connection, or a Unix domain socket (which implicitly passes client
       credentials).  This is the same mode that is entered explicitly using
       the <b>-S </b>option.  Assuming permission is allowed, one can determine
       whether <b>pmcd </b>is running in this mode by querying the value of the
       <i>pmcd.feature.creds_required</i> metric.

       Note also that because most specific match semantics are used when
       checking the connection limit, for the host-based access control
       case, priority is given to clients with more specific host
       identifiers.  It is also possible to exceed connection limits in some
       situations.  Consider the following:

              allow host clank : all, maximum 5 connections;
              allow host * : all except store, maximum 2 connections;

       This says that only 2 client connections at a time are permitted for
       all hosts other than "clank", which is permitted 5.  If a client from
       host "boing" is the first to connect to <b>pmcd</b>, its connection is
       checked against the second statement (that is the most specific match
       with a connection limit).  As there are no other clients, the
       connection is accepted and contributes towards the limit for only the
       second statement above.  If the next client connects from "clank",
       its connection is checked against the limit for the first statement.
       There are no other connections from "clank", so the connection is
       accepted.  Once this connection is accepted, it counts towards <b>both</b>
       statements' limits because "clank" matches the host identifier in
       both statements.  Remember that the decision to accept a new
       connection is made using only the most specific matching access
       control statement with a connection limit.  Now, the connection limit
       for the second statement has been reached.  Any connections from
       hosts other than "clank" will be refused.

       If instead, <b>pmcd </b>with no clients saw three successive connections
       arrived from "boing", the first two would be accepted and the third
       refused.  After that, if a connection was requested from "clank" it
       would be accepted.  It matches the first statement, which is more
       specific than the second, so the connection limit in the first is
       used to determine that the client has the right to connect.  Now
       there are 3 connections contributing to the second statement's
       connection limit.  Even though the connection limit for the second
       statement has been exceeded, the earlier connections from "boing" are
       maintained.  The connection limit is only checked at the time a
       client attempts a connection rather than being re-evaluated every
       time a new client connects to <b>pmcd</b>.

       This gentle scheme is designed to allow reasonable limits to be
       imposed on a first come first served basis, with specific exceptions.

       As illustrated by the example above, a client's connection is honored
       once it has been accepted.  However, <b>pmcd </b>reconfiguration (see the
       next section) re-evaluates all the connection counts and will cause
       client connections to be dropped where connection limits have been
       exceeded.

       If the configuration file has been changed or if an agent is not
       responding because it has terminated or the PMNS has been changed,
       <b>pmcd </b>may be reconfigured by sending it a SIGHUP, as in

            # pmsignal -a -s HUP pmcd

       When <b>pmcd </b>receives a SIGHUP, it checks the configuration file for
       changes.  If the file has been modified, it is reparsed and the
       contents become the new configuration.  If there are errors in the
       configuration file, the existing configuration is retained and the
       contents of the file are ignored.  Errors are reported in the <b>pmcd</b>
       log file.

       It also checks the PMNS file for changes. If the PMNS file has been
       modified, then it is reloaded.  Use of <a href="tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> on the log file is
       recommended while reconfiguring <b>pmcd</b>.

       If the configuration for an agent has changed (any parameter except
       the agent's label is different), the agent is restarted.  Agents
       whose configurations do not change are not restarted.  Any existing
       agents not present in the new configuration are terminated.  Any
       deceased agents are that are still listed are restarted.

       Sometimes it is necessary to restart an agent that is still running,
       but malfunctioning.  Simply stop the agent (e.g. using SIGTERM from
       <a href="pmsignal.1.html">pmsignal(1)</a>), then send <b>pmcd </b>a SIGHUP, which will cause the agent to
       be restarted.

<h2><a id="STARTING_AND_STOPPING_PMCD" href="#STARTING_AND_STOPPING_PMCD"></a>STARTING AND STOPPING PMCD  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Normally, <b>pmcd </b>is started automatically at boot time and stopped when
       the system is being brought down.  Under certain circumstances it is
       necessary to start or stop <b>pmcd </b>manually.  To do this one must become
       superuser and type

            # $PCP_RC_DIR/pmcd start

       to start <b>pmcd</b>, or

            # $PCP_RC_DIR/pmcd stop

       to stop <b>pmcd</b>.  Starting <b>pmcd </b>when it is already running is the same
       as stopping it and then starting it again.

       Sometimes it may be necessary to restart <b>pmcd </b>during another phase of
       the boot process.  Time-consuming parts of the boot process are often
       put into the background to allow the system to become available
       sooner (e.g. mounting huge databases).  If an agent run by <b>pmcd</b>
       requires such a task to complete before it can run properly, it is
       necessary to restart or reconfigure <b>pmcd </b>after the task completes.
       Consider, for example, the case of mounting a database in the
       background while booting.  If the PMDA which provides the metrics
       about the database cannot function until the database is mounted and
       available but <b>pmcd </b>is started before the database is ready, the PMDA
       will fail (however <b>pmcd </b>will still service requests for metrics from
       other domains).  If the database is initialized by running a shell
       script, adding a line to the end of the script to reconfigure <b>pmcd</b>
       (by sending it a SIGHUP) will restart the PMDA (if it exited because
       it couldn't connect to the database).  If the PMDA didn't exit in
       such a situation it would be necessary to restart <b>pmcd </b>because if the
       PMDA was still running <b>pmcd </b>would not restart it.

       Normally <b>pmcd </b>listens for client connections on TCP/IP port number
       44321 (registered at <i><a href="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org/</a> </i>).  Either the environment
       variable <b>PMCD_PORT </b>or the <b>-p </b>command line option may be used to
       specify alternative port number(s) when <b>pmcd </b>is started; in each
       case, the specification is a comma-separated list of one or more
       numerical port numbers.  Should both methods be used or multiple <b>-p</b>
       options appear on the command line, <b>pmcd </b>will listen on the union of
       the set of ports specified via all <b>-p </b>options and the <b>PMCD_PORT</b>
       environment variable.  If non-default ports are used with <b>pmcd </b>care
       should be taken to ensure that <b>PMCD_PORT </b>is also set in the
       environment of any client application that will connect to <b>pmcd</b>, or
       that the extended host specification syntax is used (see <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>
       for details).

       In addition to the PCP environment variables described in the <b>PCP</b>
       <b>ENVIRONMENT </b>section below, the <b>PMCD_PORT </b>variable is also recognised
       as the TCP/IP port for incoming connections (default <i>44321</i>), and the
       <b>PMCD_SOCKET </b>variable is also recognised as the path to be used for
       the Unix domain socket.

       If set to the value 1, the <b>PMCD_LOCAL </b>environment variable will cause
       <b>pmcd </b>to run in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds
       only to the loopback interface.  The <i>pmcd.feature.local</i> metric can be
       queried to determine if <b>pmcd </b>is running in this mode.

       The <b>PMCD_MAXPENDING </b>variable can be set to indicate the maximum
       length to which the queue of pending client connections may grow.

       The <b>PMCD_ROOT_AGENT </b>variable controls whether or not <b>pmcd </b>or <b>pmdaroot</b>
       (when available), start subsequent pmdas.  When set to a non-zero
       value, <b>pmcd </b>will opt to have <b>pmdaroot </b>start, and stop, PMDAs.

       The <b>PMCD_RESTART_AGENTS </b>variable determines the behaviour of <b>pmcd </b>in
       the presence of child PMDAs that have been observed to exit (this is
       a typical response in the presence of very large, usually domain-
       induced, PDU latencies).  When set to a non-zero value, <b>pmcd </b>will
       attempt to restart such PMDAS once every minute.  When set to zero,
       it uses the original behaviour of just logging the failure.

       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to parameterize
       the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the
       file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values for these variables.
       The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to specify an alternative
       configuration file, as described in <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="DIAGNOSTICS" href="#DIAGNOSTICS"></a>DIAGNOSTICS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If <b>pmcd </b>is already running the message "Error: OpenRequestSocket
       bind: Address may already be in use" will appear.  This may also
       appear if <b>pmcd </b>was shutdown with an outstanding request from a
       client.  In this case, a request socket has been left in the
       TIME_WAIT state and until the system closes it down (after some
       timeout period) it will not be possible to run <b>pmcd</b>.

       In addition to the standard <b>PCP </b>debugging flags, see <a href="pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>, <b>pmcd</b>
       currently uses <b>DBG_TRACE_APPL0 </b>for tracing I/O and termination of
       agents, <b>DBG_TRACE_APPL1 </b>for tracing access control and
       <b>DBG_TRACE_APPL2 </b>for tracing the configuration file scanner and
       parser.

<h2><a id="CAVEATS" href="#CAVEATS"></a>CAVEATS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>pmcd </b>does not explicitly terminate its children (agents), it only
       closes their pipes.  If an agent never checks for a closed pipe it
       may not terminate.

       The configuration file parser will only read lines of less than 1200
       characters.  This is intended to prevent accidents with binary files.

       The timeouts controlled by the <b>-t </b>option apply to IPC between <b>pmcd</b>
       and the PMDAs it spawns.  This is independent of settings of the
       environment variables <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>and <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
       (see <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) which may be used respectively to control timeouts
       for client applications trying to connect to <b>pmcd </b>and trying to
       receive information from <b>pmcd</b>.
