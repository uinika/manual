       This command provides a way to interact with p4 repositories using
       Git.

       Create a new Git repository from an existing p4 repository using <i>git</i>
       <i>p4 clone</i>, giving it one or more p4 depot paths. Incorporate new
       commits from p4 changes with <i>git p4 sync</i>. The <i>sync</i> command is also
       used to include new branches from other p4 depot paths. Submit Git
       changes back to p4 using <i>git p4 submit</i>. The command <i>git p4 rebase</i>
       does a sync plus rebases the current branch onto the updated p4
       remote branch.

<h2><a id="COMMANDS" href="#COMMANDS"></a>COMMANDS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
   <b>Clone</b>
       Generally, <i>git p4 clone</i> is used to create a new Git directory from an
       existing p4 repository:

           $ git p4 clone //depot/path/project

       This:

        1. Creates an empty Git repository in a subdirectory called <i>project</i>.

        2. Imports the full contents of the head revision from the given p4
           depot path into a single commit in the Git branch
           <i>refs/remotes/p4/master</i>.

        3. Creates a local branch, <i>master</i> from this remote and checks it
           out.

       To reproduce the entire p4 history in Git, use the <i>@all</i> modifier on
       the depot path:

           $ git p4 clone //depot/path/project@all

   <b>Sync</b>
       As development continues in the p4 repository, those changes can be
       included in the Git repository using:

           $ git p4 sync

       This command finds new changes in p4 and imports them as Git commits.

       P4 repositories can be added to an existing Git repository using <i>git</i>
       <i>p4 sync</i> too:

           $ mkdir repo-git
           $ cd repo-git
           $ git init
           $ git p4 sync //path/in/your/perforce/depot

       This imports the specified depot into <i>refs/remotes/p4/master</i> in an
       existing Git repository. The <b>--branch </b>option can be used to specify a
       different branch to be used for the p4 content.

       If a Git repository includes branches <i>refs/remotes/origin/p4</i>, these
       will be fetched and consulted first during a <i>git p4 sync</i>. Since
       importing directly from p4 is considerably slower than pulling
       changes from a Git remote, this can be useful in a multi-developer
       environment.

       If there are multiple branches, doing <i>git p4 sync</i> will automatically
       use the "BRANCH DETECTION" algorithm to try to partition new changes
       into the right branch. This can be overridden with the <b>--branch</b>
       option to specify just a single branch to update.

   <b>Rebase</b>
       A common working pattern is to fetch the latest changes from the p4
       depot and merge them with local uncommitted changes. Often, the p4
       repository is the ultimate location for all code, thus a rebase
       workflow makes sense. This command does <i>git p4 sync</i> followed by <i>git</i>
       <i>rebase</i> to move local commits on top of updated p4 changes.

           $ git p4 rebase

   <b>Submit</b>
       Submitting changes from a Git repository back to the p4 repository
       requires a separate p4 client workspace. This should be specified
       using the <b>P4CLIENT </b>environment variable or the Git configuration
       variable <i>git-p4.client</i>. The p4 client must exist, but the client root
       will be created and populated if it does not already exist.

       To submit all changes that are in the current Git branch but not in
       the <i>p4/master</i> branch, use:

           $ git p4 submit

       To specify a branch other than the current one, use:

           $ git p4 submit topicbranch

       The upstream reference is generally <i>refs/remotes/p4/master</i>, but can
       be overridden using the <b>--origin= </b>command-line option.

       The p4 changes will be created as the user invoking <i>git p4 submit</i>.
       The <b>--preserve-user </b>option will cause ownership to be modified
       according to the author of the Git commit. This option requires admin
       privileges in p4, which can be granted using <i>p4 protect</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
   <b>General options</b>
       All commands except clone accept these options.

       --git-dir &lt;dir&gt;
           Set the <b>GIT_DIR </b>environment variable. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>.

       -v, --verbose
           Provide more progress information.

   <b>Sync options</b>
       These options can be used in the initial <i>clone</i> as well as in
       subsequent <i>sync</i> operations.

       --branch &lt;ref&gt;
           Import changes into &lt;ref&gt; instead of refs/remotes/p4/master. If
           &lt;ref&gt; starts with refs/, it is used as is. Otherwise, if it does
           not start with p4/, that prefix is added.

           By default a &lt;ref&gt; not starting with refs/ is treated as the name
           of a remote-tracking branch (under refs/remotes/). This behavior
           can be modified using the --import-local option.

           The default &lt;ref&gt; is "master".

           This example imports a new remote "p4/proj2" into an existing Git
           repository:

                   $ git init
                   $ git p4 sync --branch=refs/remotes/p4/proj2 //depot/proj2

       --detect-branches
           Use the branch detection algorithm to find new paths in p4. It is
           documented below in "BRANCH DETECTION".

       --changesfile &lt;file&gt;
           Import exactly the p4 change numbers listed in <i>file</i>, one per
           line. Normally, <i>git p4</i> inspects the current p4 repository state
           and detects the changes it should import.

       --silent
           Do not print any progress information.

       --detect-labels
           Query p4 for labels associated with the depot paths, and add them
           as tags in Git. Limited usefulness as only imports labels
           associated with new changelists. Deprecated.

       --import-labels
           Import labels from p4 into Git.

       --import-local
           By default, p4 branches are stored in <i>refs/remotes/p4/</i>, where
           they will be treated as remote-tracking branches by <a href="git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a>
           and other commands. This option instead puts p4 branches in
           <i>refs/heads/p4/</i>. Note that future sync operations must specify
           <b>--import-local </b>as well so that they can find the p4 branches in
           refs/heads.

       --max-changes &lt;n&gt;
           Import at most <i>n</i> changes, rather than the entire range of changes
           included in the given revision specifier. A typical usage would
           be use <i>@all</i> as the revision specifier, but then to use
           <i>--max-changes 1000</i> to import only the last 1000 revisions rather
           than the entire revision history.

       --changes-block-size &lt;n&gt;
           The internal block size to use when converting a revision
           specifier such as <i>@all</i> into a list of specific change numbers.
           Instead of using a single call to <i>p4 changes</i> to find the full
           list of changes for the conversion, there are a sequence of calls
           to <i>p4 changes -m</i>, each of which requests one block of changes of
           the given size. The default block size is 500, which should
           usually be suitable.

       --keep-path
           The mapping of file names from the p4 depot path to Git, by
           default, involves removing the entire depot path. With this
           option, the full p4 depot path is retained in Git. For example,
           path <i>//depot/main/foo/bar.c</i>, when imported from <i>//depot/main/</i>,
           becomes <i>foo/bar.c</i>. With <b>--keep-path</b>, the Git path is instead
           <i>depot/main/foo/bar.c</i>.

       --use-client-spec
           Use a client spec to find the list of interesting files in p4.
           See the "CLIENT SPEC" section below.

       -/ &lt;path&gt;
           Exclude selected depot paths when cloning or syncing.

   <b>Clone options</b>
       These options can be used in an initial <i>clone</i>, along with the <i>sync</i>
       options described above.

       --destination &lt;directory&gt;
           Where to create the Git repository. If not provided, the last
           component in the p4 depot path is used to create a new directory.

       --bare
           Perform a bare clone. See <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>.

   <b>Submit options</b>
       These options can be used to modify <i>git p4 submit</i> behavior.

       --origin &lt;commit&gt;
           Upstream location from which commits are identified to submit to
           p4. By default, this is the most recent p4 commit reachable from
           <b>HEAD</b>.

       -M
           Detect renames. See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>. Renames will be represented in
           p4 using explicit <i>move</i> operations. There is no corresponding
           option to detect copies, but there are variables for both moves
           and copies.

       --preserve-user
           Re-author p4 changes before submitting to p4. This option
           requires p4 admin privileges.

       --export-labels
           Export tags from Git as p4 labels. Tags found in Git are applied
           to the perforce working directory.

       -n, --dry-run
           Show just what commits would be submitted to p4; do not change
           state in Git or p4.

       --prepare-p4-only
           Apply a commit to the p4 workspace, opening, adding and deleting
           files in p4 as for a normal submit operation. Do not issue the
           final "p4 submit", but instead print a message about how to
           submit manually or revert. This option always stops after the
           first (oldest) commit. Git tags are not exported to p4.

       --shelve
           Instead of submitting create a series of shelved changelists.
           After creating each shelve, the relevant files are
           reverted/deleted. If you have multiple commits pending multiple
           shelves will be created.

       --update-shelve CHANGELIST
           Update an existing shelved changelist with this commit. Implies
           --shelve.

       --conflict=(ask|skip|quit)
           Conflicts can occur when applying a commit to p4. When this
           happens, the default behavior ("ask") is to prompt whether to
           skip this commit and continue, or quit. This option can be used
           to bypass the prompt, causing conflicting commits to be
           automatically skipped, or to quit trying to apply commits,
           without prompting.

       --branch &lt;branch&gt;
           After submitting, sync this named branch instead of the default
           p4/master. See the "Sync options" section above for more
           information.

   <b>Rebase options</b>
       These options can be used to modify <i>git p4 rebase</i> behavior.

       --import-labels
           Import p4 labels.

<h2><a id="DEPOT_PATH_SYNTAX" href="#DEPOT_PATH_SYNTAX"></a>DEPOT PATH SYNTAX  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The p4 depot path argument to <i>git p4 sync</i> and <i>git p4 clone</i> can be one
       or more space-separated p4 depot paths, with an optional p4 revision
       specifier on the end:

       "//depot/my/project"
           Import one commit with all files in the <i>#head</i> change under that
           tree.

       "//depot/my/project@all"
           Import one commit for each change in the history of that depot
           path.

       "//depot/my/project@1,6"
           Import only changes 1 through 6.

       "//depot/proj1@all //depot/proj2@all"
           Import all changes from both named depot paths into a single
           repository. Only files below these directories are included.
           There is not a subdirectory in Git for each "proj1" and "proj2".
           You must use the <b>--destination </b>option when specifying more than
           one depot path. The revision specifier must be specified
           identically on each depot path. If there are files in the depot
           paths with the same name, the path with the most recently updated
           version of the file is the one that appears in Git.

       See <i>p4 help revisions</i> for the full syntax of p4 revision specifiers.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CLIENT_SPEC" href="#CLIENT_SPEC"></a>CLIENT SPEC  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The p4 client specification is maintained with the <i>p4 client</i> command
       and contains among other fields, a View that specifies how the depot
       is mapped into the client repository. The <i>clone</i> and <i>sync</i> commands can
       consult the client spec when given the <b>--use-client-spec </b>option or
       when the useClientSpec variable is true. After <i>git p4 clone</i>, the
       useClientSpec variable is automatically set in the repository
       configuration file. This allows future <i>git p4 submit</i> commands to work
       properly; the submit command looks only at the variable and does not
       have a command-line option.

       The full syntax for a p4 view is documented in <i>p4 help views</i>. <i>git p4</i>
       knows only a subset of the view syntax. It understands multi-line
       mappings, overlays with <i>+</i>, exclusions with <i>-</i> and double-quotes around
       whitespace. Of the possible wildcards, <i>git p4</i> only handles <i>...</i>, and
       only when it is at the end of the path. <i>git p4</i> will complain if it
       encounters an unhandled wildcard.

       Bugs in the implementation of overlap mappings exist. If multiple
       depot paths map through overlays to the same location in the
       repository, <i>git p4</i> can choose the wrong one. This is hard to solve
       without dedicating a client spec just for <i>git p4</i>.

       The name of the client can be given to <i>git p4</i> in multiple ways. The
       variable <i>git-p4.client</i> takes precedence if it exists. Otherwise,
       normal p4 mechanisms of determining the client are used: environment
       variable P4CLIENT, a file referenced by P4CONFIG, or the local host
       name.
</pre>
<h2><a id="BRANCH_DETECTION" href="#BRANCH_DETECTION"></a>BRANCH DETECTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       P4 does not have the same concept of a branch as Git. Instead, p4
       organizes its content as a directory tree, where by convention
       different logical branches are in different locations in the tree.
       The <i>p4 branch</i> command is used to maintain mappings between different
       areas in the tree, and indicate related content. <i>git p4</i> can use these
       mappings to determine branch relationships.

       If you have a repository where all the branches of interest exist as
       subdirectories of a single depot path, you can use <b>--detect-branches</b>
       when cloning or syncing to have <i>git p4</i> automatically find
       subdirectories in p4, and to generate these as branches in Git.

       For example, if the P4 repository structure is:

           //depot/main/...
           //depot/branch1/...

       And "p4 branch -o branch1" shows a View line that looks like:

           //depot/main/... //depot/branch1/...

       Then this <i>git p4 clone</i> command:

           git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot@all

       produces a separate branch in <i>refs/remotes/p4/</i> for //depot/main,
       called <i>master</i>, and one for //depot/branch1 called <i>depot/branch1</i>.

       However, it is not necessary to create branches in p4 to be able to
       use them like branches. Because it is difficult to infer branch
       relationships automatically, a Git configuration setting
       <i>git-p4.branchList</i> can be used to explicitly identify branch
       relationships. It is a list of "source:destination" pairs, like a
       simple p4 branch specification, where the "source" and "destination"
       are the path elements in the p4 repository. The example above relied
       on the presence of the p4 branch. Without p4 branches, the same
       result will occur with:

           git init depot
           cd depot
           git config git-p4.branchList main:branch1
           git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot@all .

<h2><a id="PERFORMANCE" href="#PERFORMANCE"></a>PERFORMANCE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The fast-import mechanism used by <i>git p4</i> creates one pack file for
       each invocation of <i>git p4 sync</i>. Normally, Git garbage compression (‐
       <a href="git-gc.1.html">git-gc(1)</a>) automatically compresses these to fewer pack files, but
       explicit invocation of <i>git repack -adf</i> may improve performance.

<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES" href="#CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES"></a>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The following config settings can be used to modify <i>git p4</i> behavior.
       They all are in the <i>git-p4</i> section.

   <b>General variables</b>
       git-p4.user
           User specified as an option to all p4 commands, with <i>-u &lt;user&gt;</i>.
           The environment variable <i>P4USER</i> can be used instead.

       git-p4.password
           Password specified as an option to all p4 commands, with <i>-P</i>
           <i>&lt;password&gt;</i>. The environment variable <i>P4PASS</i> can be used instead.

       git-p4.port
           Port specified as an option to all p4 commands, with <i>-p &lt;port&gt;</i>.
           The environment variable <i>P4PORT</i> can be used instead.

       git-p4.host
           Host specified as an option to all p4 commands, with <i>-h &lt;host&gt;</i>.
           The environment variable <i>P4HOST</i> can be used instead.

       git-p4.client
           Client specified as an option to all p4 commands, with <i>-c</i>
           <i>&lt;client&gt;</i>, including the client spec.

       git-p4.retries
           Specifies the number of times to retry a p4 command (notably, <i>p4</i>
           <i>sync</i>) if the network times out. The default value is 3. Set the
           value to 0 to disable retries or if your p4 version does not
           support retries (pre 2012.2).

   <b>Clone and sync variables</b>
       git-p4.syncFromOrigin
           Because importing commits from other Git repositories is much
           faster than importing them from p4, a mechanism exists to find p4
           changes first in Git remotes. If branches exist under
           <i>refs/remote/origin/p4</i>, those will be fetched and used when
           syncing from p4. This variable can be set to <i>false</i> to disable
           this behavior.

       git-p4.branchUser
           One phase in branch detection involves looking at p4 branches to
           find new ones to import. By default, all branches are inspected.
           This option limits the search to just those owned by the single
           user named in the variable.

       git-p4.branchList
           List of branches to be imported when branch detection is enabled.
           Each entry should be a pair of branch names separated by a colon
           (:). This example declares that both branchA and branchB were
           created from main:

               git config       git-p4.branchList main:branchA
               git config --add git-p4.branchList main:branchB

       git-p4.ignoredP4Labels
           List of p4 labels to ignore. This is built automatically as
           unimportable labels are discovered.

       git-p4.importLabels
           Import p4 labels into git, as per --import-labels.

       git-p4.labelImportRegexp
           Only p4 labels matching this regular expression will be imported.
           The default value is <i>[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+$</i>.

       git-p4.useClientSpec
           Specify that the p4 client spec should be used to identify p4
           depot paths of interest. This is equivalent to specifying the
           option <b>--use-client-spec</b>. See the "CLIENT SPEC" section above.
           This variable is a boolean, not the name of a p4 client.

       git-p4.pathEncoding
           Perforce keeps the encoding of a path as given by the originating
           OS. Git expects paths encoded as UTF-8. Use this config to tell
           git-p4 what encoding Perforce had used for the paths. This
           encoding is used to transcode the paths to UTF-8. As an example,
           Perforce on Windows often uses "cp1252" to encode path names.

       git-p4.largeFileSystem
           Specify the system that is used for large (binary) files. Please
           note that large file systems do not support the <i>git p4 submit</i>
           command. Only Git LFS is implemented right now (see
           <b>https://git-lfs.github.com/ </b><b></b>for more information). Download and
           install the Git LFS command line extension to use this option and
           configure it like this:

               git config       git-p4.largeFileSystem GitLFS

       git-p4.largeFileExtensions
           All files matching a file extension in the list will be processed
           by the large file system. Do not prefix the extensions with <i>.</i>.

       git-p4.largeFileThreshold
           All files with an uncompressed size exceeding the threshold will
           be processed by the large file system. By default the threshold
           is defined in bytes. Add the suffix k, m, or g to change the
           unit.

       git-p4.largeFileCompressedThreshold
           All files with a compressed size exceeding the threshold will be
           processed by the large file system. This option might slow down
           your clone/sync process. By default the threshold is defined in
           bytes. Add the suffix k, m, or g to change the unit.

       git-p4.largeFilePush
           Boolean variable which defines if large files are automatically
           pushed to a server.

       git-p4.keepEmptyCommits
           A changelist that contains only excluded files will be imported
           as an empty commit if this boolean option is set to true.

       git-p4.mapUser
           Map a P4 user to a name and email address in Git. Use a string
           with the following format to create a mapping:

               git config --add git-p4.mapUser "p4user = First Last &lt;mail@address.com&gt;"

           A mapping will override any user information from P4. Mappings
           for multiple P4 user can be defined.

   <b>Submit variables</b>
       git-p4.detectRenames
           Detect renames. See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>. This can be true, false, or a
           score as expected by <i>git diff -M</i>.

       git-p4.detectCopies
           Detect copies. See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>. This can be true, false, or a
           score as expected by <i>git diff -C</i>.

       git-p4.detectCopiesHarder
           Detect copies harder. See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>. A boolean.

       git-p4.preserveUser
           On submit, re-author changes to reflect the Git author,
           regardless of who invokes <i>git p4 submit</i>.

       git-p4.allowMissingP4Users
           When <i>preserveUser</i> is true, <i>git p4</i> normally dies if it cannot find
           an author in the p4 user map. This setting submits the change
           regardless.

       git-p4.skipSubmitEdit
           The submit process invokes the editor before each p4 change is
           submitted. If this setting is true, though, the editing step is
           skipped.

       git-p4.skipSubmitEditCheck
           After editing the p4 change message, <i>git p4</i> makes sure that the
           description really was changed by looking at the file
           modification time. This option disables that test.

       git-p4.allowSubmit
           By default, any branch can be used as the source for a <i>git p4</i>
           <i>submit</i> operation. This configuration variable, if set, permits
           only the named branches to be used as submit sources. Branch
           names must be the short names (no "refs/heads/"), and should be
           separated by commas (","), with no spaces.

       git-p4.skipUserNameCheck
           If the user running <i>git p4 submit</i> does not exist in the p4 user
           map, <i>git p4</i> exits. This option can be used to force submission
           regardless.

       git-p4.attemptRCSCleanup
           If enabled, <i>git p4 submit</i> will attempt to cleanup RCS keywords
           ($Header$, etc). These would otherwise cause merge conflicts and
           prevent the submit going ahead. This option should be considered
           experimental at present.

       git-p4.exportLabels
           Export Git tags to p4 labels, as per --export-labels.

       git-p4.labelExportRegexp
           Only p4 labels matching this regular expression will be exported.
           The default value is <i>[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+$</i>.

       git-p4.conflict
           Specify submit behavior when a conflict with p4 is found, as per
           --conflict. The default behavior is <i>ask</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS" href="#IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS"></a>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       ·   Changesets from p4 are imported using Git fast-import.

       ·   Cloning or syncing does not require a p4 client; file contents
           are collected using <i>p4 print</i>.

       ·   Submitting requires a p4 client, which is not in the same
           location as the Git repository. Patches are applied, one at a
           time, to this p4 client and submitted from there.

       ·   Each commit imported by <i>git p4</i> has a line at the end of the log
           message indicating the p4 depot location and change number. This
           line is used by later <i>git p4 sync</i> operations to know which p4
           changes are new.
