       <b>PCPIntro </b>- introduction to the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
</pre>
<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION" href="#INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a toolkit designed for monitoring
       and managing system-level performance.  These services are
       distributed and scalable to accommodate the most complex system
       configurations and performance problems.

       PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to)
       Linux, MacOSX, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be
       considered to contain two classes of software utility:

       <i>PCP Collectors</i>
               These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract
               performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating
               system kernel.

       <i>PCP Monitors</i>
               These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from
               hosts (or archives) that have the <i>PCP Collector</i> installed.
               Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP
               release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools
               are available separately in the PCP GUI package.

       This manual entry describes the high-level features and options
       common to most PCP utilities available on all platforms.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OVERVIEW" href="#OVERVIEW"></a>OVERVIEW  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool
       may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored,
       each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service
       layer, a database management system, a web server, an application,
       etc.  requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is
       responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.
       All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
       (<a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>) on the same host.

       Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, which
       acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the
       appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients
       may also access performance data from sets of PCP archives (created
       using <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>) for retrospective analysis.

   <b>Security philosophy</b>
       PCP redistributes a wealth of performance information within a host
       and across its networks.  The following security philosophy underlies
       the setting of several <i>defaults</i> that control how much information is
       sent and received.

       By default, the information exposed by PMCD about a host is
       approximately of the same level of confidentiality as available to a
       completely unprivileged user on that host.  So, performance data that
       is available to be <i>read</i> completely freely on a machine may be made
       available by PMCD to the network.

       However, the host running PMCD and its network is <i>not</i> assumed to run
       only friendly applications.  Therefore, <i>write</i> type operations,
       including from the local host, are not permitted by default.

       These defaults may be overridden (expanded or reduced) in several
       ways, including by specifying network ACLs in <b>pmcd.conf</b>, activating
       non-default PMDAs, or by using PMCD connections that pass user
       credentials.  For example, some PMDAs automatically provide greater
       information for particular credentialed users or groups.

   <b>Applications</b>
       The following performance monitoring applications are primarily
       console based, typically run directly from the command line, and are
       just a small subset of the tools available as part of the base PCP
       package.

       Each tool or command is documented completely in its own reference
       page.

       <b>pmstat </b>Outputs an ASCII high-level summary of system performance.

       <b>pmie   </b>An inference engine that can evaluate predicate-action rules
              to perform alarms and automate system management tasks.

       <b>pminfo </b>Interrogate specific performance metrics and the metadata that
              describes them.

       <b>pmlogger</b>
              Generates PCP archives of performance metrics suitable for
              replay by most PCP tools.

       <b>pmrep  </b>Highly customizable performance metrics reporter with support
              for various different output modes.

       <b>pmval  </b>Simple periodic reporting for some or all instances of a
              performance metric, with optional VCR time control.

       If the PCP GUI package is installed then the following additional
       tools are available.

       <b>pmchart</b>
              Displays trends over time of arbitrarily selected performance
              metrics from one or more hosts.

       <b>pmtime </b>Time control utility for coordinating the time between
              multiple tools (including pmchart and pmval).

       <b>pmdumptext</b>
              Produce ASCII reports for arbitrary combinations of
              performance metrics.

<h2><a id="COMMON_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS" href="#COMMON_COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS"></a>COMMON COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There is a set of common command line arguments that are used
       consistently by most PCP tools.

       <b>-a </b><i>archive</i>
              Performance metric information is retrospectively retrieved
              from the set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives identified
              by <i>archive</i>, previously generated by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.<b>See</b>
              <a href="../man5/pcp-archive.5.html">pcp-archive(5)</a> for format documentation.  The <b>-a </b>and <b>-h</b>
              options are mutually exclusive.

              <i>archive</i> is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may
              be the name of a directory containing one or more archives,
              the base name common to all of the physical files created by
              an instance of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, or any one of the physical files,
              e.g.  <i>/path/to/myarchives</i> (directory) or <i>myarchive</i> (base name)
              or <i>myarchive</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata file) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.index </b>(the
              temporal index) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0 </b>(the first data volume of
              <i>archive</i>) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.bz2 </b>or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.bz </b>(the first data
              volume compressed with <b>bzip2</b>(1)) or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.gz </b>or
              <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.Z </b>or <i>myarchive</i><b>.0.z </b>(the first data volume
              compressed with <b>gzip</b>(1)), <i>myarchive</i><b>.1 </b>or <i>myarchive</i><b>.3.bz2 </b>or
              <i>myarchive</i><b>.42.gz </b>etc.

       <b>-h </b><i>hostname</i>
              Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, or to a set
              of archives by the <b>-a </b>option, the source of performance
              metrics will be the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
              (PMCD) on the local host.  Refer to the <b>PMCD HOST</b>
              <b>SPECIFICATION </b>section later for further details on the many
              options available when forming the <i>hostname</i> specification, as
              well as a detailed description of the default local host
              connection.  The <b>-a </b>and <b>-h </b>options are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-s </b><i>samples</i>
              The argument <i>samples</i> defines the number of samples to be
              retrieved and reported.  If <i>samples</i> is 0 or <b>-s </b>is not
              specified, the application will sample and report continuously
              (in real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP
              archives (in archive mode).

       <b>-z     </b>Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
              host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
              identified via either the <b>-h </b>or <b>-a </b>options.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>
              By default, applications report the time of day according to
              the local timezone on the system where the application is
              executed.  The <b>-Z </b>option changes the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in
              the format of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described in
              <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="INTERVAL_SPECIFICATION_AND_ALIGNMENT" href="#INTERVAL_SPECIFICATION_AND_ALIGNMENT"></a>INTERVAL SPECIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Most PCP tools operate with periodic sampling or reporting, and the
       <b>-t </b>and <b>-A </b>options may be used to control the duration of the sample
       interval and the alignment of the sample times.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>
              Set the update or reporting interval.

              The <i>interval</i> argument is specified as a sequence of one or
              more elements of the form
                        <i>number</i>[<i>units</i>]
              where <i>number</i> is an integer or floating point constant (parsed
              using <a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod(3)</a>) and the optional <i>units</i> is one of: <b>seconds</b>,
              <b>second</b>, <b>secs</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>minute</b>, <b>mins</b>, <b>min</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>hours</b>,
              <b>hour</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>days</b>, <b>day </b>and <b>d</b>.  If the <i>unit</i> is empty, <b>second </b>is
              assumed.

              In addition, the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of
              the above is also acceptable.

              Spaces anywhere in the <i>interval</i> are ignored, so <b>4 days 6 hours</b>
              <b>30 minutes</b>, <b>4day6hour30min</b>, <b>4d6h30m </b>and <b>4d6.5h </b>are all
              equivalent.

              Multiple specifications are additive, e.g. ``<b>1hour 15mins</b>
              <b>30secs</b>'' is interpreted as 3600+900+30 seconds.

       <b>-A </b><i>align</i>
              By default samples are not necessarily aligned on any natural
              unit of time.  The <b>-A </b>option may be used to force the initial
              sample to be aligned on the boundary of a natural time unit.
              For example <b>-A 1sec</b>, <b>-A 30min </b>and <b>-A 1hour </b>specify alignment
              on whole seconds, half and whole hours respectively.

              The <i>align</i> argument follows the syntax for an <i>interval</i> argument
              described above for the <b>-t </b>option.

              Note that alignment occurs by advancing the time as required,
              and that <b>-A </b>acts as a modifier to advance both the start of
              the time window (see the next section) and the origin time (if
              the <b>-O </b>option is specified).
</pre>
<h2><a id="TIME_WINDOW_SPECIFICATION" href="#TIME_WINDOW_SPECIFICATION"></a>TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Many PCP tools are designed to operate in some time window of
       interest, e.g. to define a termination time for real-time monitoring
       or to define a start and end time within a set of PCP archive logs.

       In the absence of the <b>-O </b>and <b>-A </b>options to specify an initial sample
       time origin and time alignment (see above), the PCP application will
       retrieve the first sample at the start of the time window.

       The following options may be used to specify a time window of
       interest.

       <b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>
              By default the time window commences immediately in real-time
              mode, or coincides with time at the start of the set of PCP
              archive logs in archive mode.  The <b>-S </b>option may be used to
              specify a later time for the start of the time window.

              The <i>starttime</i> parameter may be given in one of three forms
              (<i>interval</i> is the same as for the <b>-t </b>option as described above,
              <i>datetime</i> is described below):

              <i>interval</i>
                     To specify an offset from the current time (in real-
                     time mode) or the beginning of a set of PCP archives
                     (in archive mode) simply specify the interval of time
                     as the argument.  For example <b>-S 30min </b>will set the
                     start of the time window to be exactly 30 minutes from
                     now in real-time mode, or exactly 30 minutes from the
                     start of a set of PCP archives.

              -<i>interval</i>
                     To specify an offset from the end of a set of PCP
                     archive logs, prefix the <i>interval</i> argument with a minus
                     sign.  In this case, the start of the time window
                     precedes the time at the end of the set of archives by
                     the given interval.  For example <b>-S -1hour </b>will set the
                     start of the time window to be exactly one hour before
                     the time of the last sample in a set of PCP archive
                     logs.

              @<i>datetime</i>
                     To specify the calendar date and time (local time in
                     the reporting timezone) for the start of the time
                     window, use the datetime syntax preceded by an at sign.
                     Refer to the datetime description below for detailed
                     information.

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>
              By default the end of the time window is unbounded (in real-
              time mode) or aligned with the time at the end of a set of PCP
              archive logs (in archive mode).  The <b>-T </b>option may be used to
              specify an earlier time for the end of the time window.

              The <i>endtime</i> parameter may be given in one of three forms
              (<i>interval</i> is the same as for the <b>-t </b>option as described above,
              <i>datetime</i> is described below):

              <i>interval</i>
                     To specify an offset from the start of the time window
                     simply use the interval of time as the argument.  For
                     example <b>-T 2h30m </b>will set the end of the time window to
                     be 2 hours and 30 minutes after the start of the time
                     window.

              -<i>interval</i>
                     To specify an offset back from the time at the end of a
                     set of PCP archive logs, prefix the <i>interval</i> argument
                     with a minus sign.  For example <b>-T -90m </b>will set the
                     end of the time window to be 90 minutes before the time
                     of the last sample in a set of PCP archive logs.

              @<i>datetime</i>
                     To specify the calendar date and time (local time in
                     the reporting timezone) for the end of the time window,
                     use the datetime syntax preceded by an at sign.  Refer
                     to the datetime description below for detailed
                     information.

       <b>-O </b><i>origin</i>
              By default samples are fetched from the start of the time
              window (see description of <b>-S </b>option) to the end of the time
              window (see description of <b>-T </b>option).  The <b>-O </b>option allows
              the specification of an origin within the time window to be
              used as the initial sample time.  This is useful for
              interactive use of a PCP tool with the <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> VCR replay
              facility.

              The <i>origin</i> argument accepted by <b>-O </b>conforms to the same syntax
              and semantics as the <i>starttime</i> argument for the <b>-T </b>option.

              For example <b>-O -0 </b>specifies that the initial position should
              be at the end of the time window; this is most useful when
              wishing to replay ``backwards'' within the time window.

       The <i>datetime</i> argument for the <b>-O</b>, <b>-S </b>and <b>-T </b>options consists of:
                 <b>date time zone day relative</b>
       A date can be one of: YY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, DD Month YYYY, or Month DD
       YYYY.  A time can be one of: HH:MM:SS, HH:MM.  HH:MM can use either
       the 12 hour (via an am or pm suffix) or 24 hour convention.  A day of
       the week can be a spelled out day of the week, optionally preceded by
       an ordinal number such as second tuesday.  A zone is a time zone
       value as specified by the <b>tzselect</b>(1) command.  A relative time can
       be a time unit that is: preceded by a cardinal number such as 1 year
       or 2 months, preceded by one of the time words this or last, or
       succeeded by the time word ago.  A relative time can also be one of
       the time words: yesterday, today, tomorrow, now.  Examples of
       datetime strings are: <b>1996-03-04 13:07:47 EST Mon</b>, <b>1996-03-05</b>
       <b>14:07:47 EST -1hour</b>, <b>Mon Mar  4 13:07:47 1996</b>, <b>Mar 4 1996</b>, <b>Mar 4</b>,
       <b>Mar</b>, <b>13:07:50 </b>or <b>13:08</b>.

       For any missing low order fields, the default value of 0 is assumed
       for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month and Jan for
       months.  Hence, the following are equivalent: <b>-S '@ Mar 1996' </b>and <b>-S</b>
       <b>'@ Mar 1 00:00:00 1996'</b>.

       If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by starting
       with the year, month and day from the current time (real-time mode)
       or the time at the beginning of the set of PCP archive logs (archive
       mode) and advancing the time until it matches the fields that are
       specified.  So, for example if the time window starts by default at
       ``Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'', then <b>-S @13:10 </b>corresponds to 13:10:00
       on Mon Mar 4, 1996, while <b>-S @10:00 </b>corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue
       Mar 5, 1996 (note this is the following day).

       For greater precision than afforded by <b>datetime</b>(3), the seconds
       component may be a floating point number.

       If a timezone is not included in a <i>datetime</i> then there ares several
       interpretations available depending on the other command line options
       used.  The default is to use the local timezone on the system where
       the PCP tool is being run.  A <b>-Z </b>option specifies an explicit
       timezone, else a <b>-z </b>option changes the timezone to the local timezone
       at the host that is the source of the performance metrics.

<h2><a id="PERFORMANCE_METRICS_-_NAMES_AND_IDENTIFIERS" href="#PERFORMANCE_METRICS_-_NAMES_AND_IDENTIFIERS"></a>PERFORMANCE METRICS - NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The number of performance metric names supported by PCP on most
       platforms ranges from many hundreds to several thousand.  The PCP
       libraries and applications use an internal identification scheme that
       unambiguously associates a single integer with each known performance
       metric.  This integer is known as the Performance Metric Identifier,
       or PMID.  Although not a requirement, PMIDs tend to have global
       consistency across all systems, so a particular performance metric
       usually has the same PMID.

       For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be
       inappropriate (e.g. this would limit the range of accessible metrics,
       make the code hard to maintain, force the user interface to be
       particularly baroque, etc.).  Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space
       (PMNS) is used to provide external names and a hierarchic
       classification for performance metrics.  A PMNS is represented as a
       tree, with each node having a label, a pointer to either a PMID (for
       leaf nodes) or a set of descendent nodes in the PMNS (for non-leaf
       nodes).

       A node label must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by
       zero or more characters drawn from the alphabetics, the digits and
       character `_´ (underscore).  For alphabetic characters in a node
       label, upper and lower case are distinguished.

       By convention, the name of a performance metric is constructed by
       concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS from the
       root node to a leaf node, with a ``.'' as a separator.  The root node
       in the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label
       associated with one of the descendent nodes below the root node of
       the PMNS, e.g. <i>kernel.percpu.syscall</i>.  Typically (although this is
       not a requirement) there would be at most one name for each PMID in a
       PMNS.  For example <i>kernel.all.cpu.idle</i> and <i>disk.dev.read</i> are the
       unique names for two distinct performance metrics, each with a unique
       PMID.

       Groups of related PMIDs may be named by naming a non-leaf node in the
       PMNS tree, e.g. <i>disk</i>.

       The default local PMNS used by <b>pmcd </b>is located at
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root </b>however the environment variable <b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b>
       may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will then
       be used as the default local PMNS.

       Most applications do not use the local PMNS directly, but rather
       import parts of the PMNS as required from the same place that
       performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> for live
       monitoring or from a set of PCP archives for retrospective
       monitoring.

       To explore the PMNS use <a href="pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a>, or if the PCP GUI package is
       installed the New Chart and Metric Search windows within <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>.

       In configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line options,
       metric specifications adhere to the following syntax rules.

       If the source of performance metrics is real-time from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> then
       the accepted syntax is
                 <i>host</i><b>:</b><i>metric</i><b>[</b><i>instance1</i><b>,</b><i>instance2</i><b>,</b>...<b>]</b>

       If the source of performance metrics is a set of PCP archive logs
       then the accepted syntax is
                 <i>archive</i><b>/</b><i>metric</i><b>[</b><i>instance1</i><b>,</b><i>instance2</i><b>,</b>...<b>]</b>

       The <i>host</i><b>:</b>, <i>archive</i><b>/ </b>and <b>[</b><i>instance1</i><b>,</b><i>instance2</i><b>,</b>...<b>]  </b>components are all
       optional.

       The <b>, </b>delimiter in the list of instance names may be replaced by
       white space.

       Special characters in <i>instance</i> names may be escaped by surrounding
       the name in double quotes or preceding the character with a
       backslash.

       White space is ignored everywhere except within a quoted <i>instance</i>
       name.

       An empty <i>instance</i> is silently ignored, and in particular ``<b>[]</b>'' is
       the same as no <i>instance</i>, while ``<b>[one,,,two]</b>'' is parsed as
       specifying just the two instances ``<b>one</b>'' and ``<b>two</b>''.

       As a special case, if the <b>host </b>is the single character ``@'' then
       this refers to a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>source, see <a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a>.

       Since PCP version 3.6.11, a monitor can explicitly request a secure
       connection to a collector host running <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> or <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a> using
       the PM_CTXFLAG_SECURE context flag.  If the PCP Collector host
       supports this feature - refer to the pmcd.feature.secure metric for
       confirmation of this - a TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security or Secure
       Sockets Layer) connection can be established which uses public key
       cryptography and related techniques.  These features aim to prevent
       eavesdropping and data tampering from a malicious third party, as
       well as providing server-side authentication (confident
       identification of a server by a client) which can be used to guard
       against man-in-the-middle attacks.

       A secure <b>pmcd </b>connection requires use of certificate-based
       authentication.  The security features offered by <b>pmcd </b>and <b>pmproxy</b>
       are implemented using the Network Security Services (NSS) APIs and
       utilities.  The NSS <b>certutil </b>tool can be used to create certificates
       suitable for establishing trust between PCP monitor and collector
       hosts.

       A complete description is beyond the scope of this document, refer to
       the <b>PCP ENVIRONMENT</b>, <b>FILES </b>and <b>SEE ALSO </b>sections for detailed
       information.  This includes links to tutorials on the steps involved
       in setting up the available security features.

<h2><a id="PMCD_HOST_SPECIFICATION" href="#PMCD_HOST_SPECIFICATION"></a>PMCD HOST SPECIFICATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       In the absence of an explicit host name specification, most tools
       will default to the local host in live update mode.  In PCP releases
       since 3.8.4 onward, this results in an efficient local protocol being
       selected - typically a Unix domain socket.  If this option is used
       (which can also be explicitly requested via the <i>unix:</i> host
       specification described below), it is important to note that all
       connections will be automatically authenticated. In other words, the
       credentials of the user invoking a client tool will automatically be
       made available to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and all of its PMDAs, on the users behalf,
       such that results can be customized to the privilege levels of
       individual users.

       Names of remote hosts running the <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> daemon can of course also
       be provided to request a remote host be used.  The most basic form of
       <b>pmcd </b>host specification is a simple host name, possibly including the
       domain name if necessary.  However, this can be extended in a number
       of ways to further refine attributes of the connection made to <b>pmcd</b>.

       The <b>pmcd </b>port number and also optional <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a> hostname and its
       port number, can be given as part of the host specification, since
       PCP version 3.0.  These supersede (and override) the old-style
       PMCD_PORT, PMPROXY_HOST and PMPROXY_PORT environment variables.

       The following are valid hostname specifications that specify
       connections to <b>pmcd </b>on host <i>nas1.servers.com</i> with/without a list of
       ports, with/without a <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a> connection through a firewall, and
       with IPv6 and IPv4 addresses as shown.

            $ pcp -h nas1.servers.com:44321,4321@firewall.servers.com:44322
            $ pcp -h nas1.servers.com:44321@firewall.servers.com:44322
            $ pcp -h nas1.servers.com:44321@firewall.servers.com
            $ pcp -h nas1.servers.com@firewall.servers.com
            $ pcp -h nas1.servers.com:44321
            $ pcp -h [fe80::2ad2:44ff:fe88:e4f1%p2p1]
            $ pcp -h 192.168.0.103

       In addition, ``connection attributes'' can also be specified.  These
       include username, password (can be given interactively and may depend
       on the authentication mechanism employed), whether to target a
       specific running container, whether to use secure (encrypted) or
       native (naked) protocol, and so on.  The previous examples all
       default to native protocol, and use no authentication.  This can be
       altered, as in the following examples.

            $ pcp -h pcps://app2.servers.com?container=cae8e6edc0d5
            $ pcp -h pcps://nas1.servers.com:44321?username=tanya&amp;method=gssapi
            $ pcp -h pcps://nas2.servers.com@firewalls.r.us?method=plain
            $ pcp -h pcp://nas3.servers.com
            $ pcp -h 192.168.0.103?container=cae8e6edc0d5,method=digest-md5
            $ pcp -h unix:
            $ pcp -h local:

       The choice of authentication method, and other resulting parameters
       like username, optionally password, etc, depends on the SASL2
       configuration used by each (remote) <b>pmcd</b>.  Tutorials are available
       specifying various aspects of configuring the authentication
       module(s) used, these fine details are outside the scope of this
       document.

       In all situations, host names can be used interchangeably with IPv4
       or IPv6 addressing (directly), as shown above.  In the case of an
       IPv6 address, the full address must be enclosed by square brackets
       and the scope (interface) must also be specified.

       The final <i>local:</i> example above is now the default for most tools.
       This connection is an automatically authenticated local host
       connection on all platforms that support Unix domain sockets.  No
       password is required and authentication is automatic.  This is also
       the most efficient (lowest overhead) communication channel available.

       The difference between <i>unix:</i> and <i>local:</i> is that the former is a
       strict Unix domain socket specification (connection fails if it
       cannot connect that way), whereas the latter has a more forgiving
       fallback to using <i>localhost</i> (i.e. a regular Inet socket connection is
       used when Unix domain socket connections are unavailable).

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT" href="#ENVIRONMENT"></a>ENVIRONMENT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       In addition to the PCP run-time environment and configuration
       variables described in the <b>PCP ENVIRONMENT </b>section below, the
       following environment variables apply to all installations.

       Note that most uses of these environment variables are optimized to
       check the environment only the first time the variable might be used.
       As the environment usually is not checked again, the only safe
       strategy is to ensure all PCP-related environment variables are set
       before the first call into any of the PCP libraries.

       <b>PCP_ALLOW_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN</b>
              When set, allow clients to accept certificates with mismatched
              domain names with no prompt when they are sent by <b>pmcd </b>or
              other server components.  See <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b>

       <b>PCP_ALLOW_SERVER_SELF_CERT</b>
              When set, allow clients to accept self-signed certificates
              with no prompt when they are sent by <b>pmcd </b>or other server
              components.  See <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b>

       <b>PCP_CONSOLE</b>
              When set, this changes the default console from <i>/dev/tty</i> (on
              Unix) or <i>CON:</i> (on Windows) to be the specified console.  The
              special value of <i>none</i> can be used to indicate no console is
              available for use.  This is used in places where console-based
              tools need to interact with the user, and in particular is
              used when authentication is being performed.

       <b>PCP_DEBUG</b>
              When set, this variable provides an alternate way to
              initialize the value used to control diagnostic and debug
              output (the default value is 0 to suppress this output).  The
              value for <b>$PCP_DEBUG </b>should be a decimal integer, see <a href="pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>
              for a description of the supported values.

       <b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b>
              When set, this variable defines a colon separated list of
              files and/or directories (the syntax is the same as for the
              <b>$PATH </b>variable for <b>sh</b>(1)).  The components are expanded into a
              list of files as follows: if a component of
              <b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG </b>is a file, then that file is added to the
              list, else if a component is a directory then recursive
              descent is used to enumerate all files below that directory
              and these are added to the list.

              Each file in the resulting list is assumed to contain
              definitions of derived metrics as per the syntax described in
              <a href="../man3/pmLoadDerivedConfig.3.html">pmLoadDerivedConfig(3)</a>, and these are loaded in order.

              Derived metrics may be used to extend the available metrics
              with new (derived) metrics using simple arithmetic
              expressions.

              If <b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG </b>is set, the derived metric definitions
              are processed automatically as each new source of performance
              metrics is established (i.e. each time a <a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a> is
              called) or when requests are made against the PMNS.

              Any component in the <b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG </b>list or the expanded
              list of files that is not a file, or is not a directory or is
              not accessible (due to permissions or a bad symbolic link)
              will be silently ignored.

       <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS</b>
              When set, this variable forces any monitor tool connections to
              be established using the certificate-based secure sockets
              feature.  If the connections cannot be established securely,
              they will fail.

       <b>PCP_SECURE_DB_METHOD</b>
              With secure socket connections, the certificate and key
              database is stored using the <b>sql: </b>method by default.  Use
              <b>PCP_SECURE_DB_METHOD </b>to override the default, most usually
              setting the value to the empty string (for the older database
              methods).

       <b>PCP_SECURE_DB_PATH</b>
              When set, this variable specifies an alternate certficate
              database path for client tools.  Similar to the action of the
              -C option for <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a>.

       <b>PCP_STDERR</b>
              Many PCP tools support the environment variable <b>PCP_STDERR</b>,
              which can be used to control where error messages are sent.
              When unset, the default behavior is that ``usage'' messages
              and option parsing errors are reported on standard error,
              other messages after initial startup are sent to the default
              destination for the tool, i.e. standard error for ASCII tools,
              or a dialog for GUI tools.

              If <b>PCP_STDERR </b>is set to the literal value <b>DISPLAY </b>then all
              messages will be displayed in a dialog.  This is used for any
              tools launched from the a Desktop environment.

              If <b>PCP_STDERR </b>is set to any other value, the value is assumed
              to be a filename, and all messages will be written there.

       <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When attempting to connect to a remote <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on a machine
              that is booting, the connection attempt could potentially
              block for a long time until the remote machine finishes its
              initialization.  Most PCP applications and some of the PCP
              library routines will abort and return an error if the
              connection has not been established after some specified
              interval has elapsed.  The default interval is 5 seconds.
              This may be modified by setting <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>in the
              environment to a real number of seconds for the desired
              timeout.  This is most useful in cases where the remote host
              is at the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to
              establish the connection correctly.

       <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When a monitor or client application loses a connection to a
              <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, the connection may be re-established by calling a
              service routine in the PCP library.  However, attempts to
              reconnect are controlled by a back-off strategy to avoid
              flooding the network with reconnection requests.  By default,
              the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 seconds for
              consecutive reconnection requests from a client (the last
              delay will be repeated for any further attempts after the
              fifth).  Setting the environment variable
              <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>to a comma separated list of positive
              integers will re-define the back-off delays, e.g. setting
              <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>to ``1,2'' will back-off for 1 second,
              then attempt another connection request every 2 seconds
              thereafter.

       <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
              For monitor or client applications connected to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, there
              is a possibility of the application "hanging" on a request for
              performance metrics or metadata or help text.  These delays
              may become severe if the system running <b>pmcd </b>crashes, or the
              network connection is lost.  By setting the environment
              variable <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>to a number of seconds, requests
              to <b>pmcd </b>will timeout after this number of seconds.  The
              default behavior is to be willing to wait 10 seconds for a
              response from every <b>pmcd </b>for all applications.

       <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is started from <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp </b>then the primary
              instance of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> will be started if the configuration
              flag <b>pmlogger </b>is <b>chkconfig</b>(8) enabled and <b>pmcd </b>is running and
              accepting connections.

              The check on <b>pmcd</b>'s readiness will wait up to
              <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT </b>seconds.  If <b>pmcd </b>has a long startup time
              (such as on a very large system), then <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT </b>can
              be set to provide a maximum wait longer than the default 60
              seconds.

       <b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b>
              If set, then interpreted as the full pathname to be used as
              the default local PMNS for <a href="../man3/pmLoadNameSpace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a>.  Otherwise, the
              default local PMNS is located at <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pcp/pmns/root</b>
              for base PCP installations.

       <b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</b>
              Many of the performance metrics exported from PCP agents have
              the semantics of <i>counter</i> meaning they are expected to be
              monotonically increasing.  Under some circumstances, one value
              of these metrics may smaller than the previously fetched
              value.  This can happen when a counter of finite precision
              overflows, or when the PCP agent has been reset or restarted,
              or when the PCP agent is exporting values from some underlying
              instrumentation that is subject to some asynchronous
              discontinuity.

              The environment variable <b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP </b>may be set to
              indicate that all such cases of a decreasing ``counter''
              should be treated as a counter overflow, and hence the values
              are assumed to have wrapped once in the interval between
              consecutive samples.  This ``wrapping'' behavior was the
              default in earlier PCP versions, but by default has been
              disabled in PCP release from version 1.3 on.

       <b>PMDA_PATH</b>
              The <b>PMDA_PATH </b>environment variable may be used to modify the
              search path used by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and <a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a> (for
              <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>contexts) when searching for a daemon or DSO
              PMDA.  The syntax follows that for <b>PATH </b>in <b>sh</b>(1), i.e. a colon
              separated list of directories, and the default search path is
              ``/var/pcp/lib:/usr/pcp/lib'', (or ``/var/lib/pcp/lib'' on
              Linux, depending on the value of the $PCP_VAR_DIR environment
              variable).

       <b>PMCD_PORT</b>
              The TPC/IP port(s) used by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to create the socket for
              incoming connections and requests, was historically 4321 and
              more recently the officially registered port 44321; in the
              current release, <b>both </b>port numbers are used by default as a
              transitional arrangement.  This may be over-ridden by setting
              <b>PMCD_PORT </b>to a different port number, or a comma-separated
              list of port numbers.  If a non-default port is used when <b>pmcd</b>
              is started, then every monitoring application connecting to
              that <b>pmcd </b>must also have <b>PMCD_PORT </b>set in their environment
              before attempting a connection.

       The following environment variables are relevant to installations in
       which <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, the PCP archive logger, is used.

       <b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b>
              The environment variable <b>PMLOGGER_PORT </b>may be used to change
              the base TCP/IP port number used by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> to create the
              socket to which <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> instances will try and connect.  The
              default base port number is 4330.  When used, <b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b>
              should be set in the environment before <b>pmlogger </b>is executed.

       <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
              When <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> connects to <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, there is a remote
              possibility of <b>pmlc </b>"hanging" on a request for information as
              a consequence of a failure of the network or <b>pmlogger</b>.  By
              setting the environment variable <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>to a
              number of seconds, requests to <b>pmlogger </b>will timeout after
              this number of seconds.  The default behavior is to be willing
              to wait forever for a response from each request to a
              <b>pmlogger</b>.  When used, <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>should be set
              in the environment before <b>pmlc </b>is executed.

       If you have the PCP product installed, then the following environment
       variables are relevant to the Performance Metrics Domain Agents
       (PMDAs).

       <b>PMDA_LOCAL_PROC</b>
              Use this variable has been deprecated and it is now ignored.
              If the ``proc'' PMDA is configured as a DSO for use with
              <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the local host then all of the ``proc'' metrics
              will be available to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
              context.

              The previous behaviour was that if this variable was set, then
              a context established with the <i>type</i> of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>will
              have access to the ``proc'' PMDA to retrieve performance
              metrics about individual processes.

       <b>PMDA_LOCAL_SAMPLE</b>
              Use this variable has been deprecated and it is now ignored.
              If the ``sample'' PMDA is configured as a DSO for use with
              <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the local host then all of the ``sample'' metrics
              will be available to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
              context.

              The previous behaviour was that if this variable was set, then
              a context established with the <i>type</i> of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>will
              have access to the ``sample'' PMDA if this optional PMDA has
              been installed locally.

       <b>PMIECONF_PATH</b>
              If set, <a href="pmieconf.1.html">pmieconf(1)</a> will form its <a href="../man5/pmieconf.5.html">pmieconf(5)</a> specification
              (set of parameterized <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> rules) using all valid <b>pmieconf</b>
              files found below each subdirectory in this colon-separated
              list of subdirectories.  If not set, the default is
