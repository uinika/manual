       abipkgdiff - compare ABIs of ELF files in software packages

       <b>abipkgdiff  </b>compares  the  Application Binary Interfaces (ABI) of the
       <i>ELF</i> binaries contained in two software packages.  The software  pack‐
       age  formats  currently  supported are <i>Deb</i>, <i>RPM</i>, <i>tar</i> archives (either
       compressed or not) and plain directories that contain binaries.

       For a comprehensive ABI change report  that  includes  changes  about
       function  and  variable  sub-types,  the  two  input packages must be
       accompanied with their debug information packages that contain  debug
       information in <i>DWARF</i> format.

       abipkgdiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges
       their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might
       be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It's located by the optional environment variable
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression
         file $libdir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file
         is not present, then no default system-wide suppression
         specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It's located by the optional environment
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression
         file $HOME/.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default
         user suppression specification is loaded.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
          · <b>--help | -h</b>

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · <i>--version | -v</i>

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · <b>--debug-info-pkg1 | --d1 </b>&lt;path&gt;

            For cases where the debug information for <i>package1</i> is split out
            into a separate file, tells <b>abipkgdiff </b>where to find that
            separate debug information package.

          · <b>--debug-info-pkg2 | --d2 </b>&lt;path&gt;

            For cases where the debug information for <i>package2</i> is split out
            into a separate file, tells <b>abipkgdiff </b>where to find that
            separate debug information package.

          · <b>--devel-pkg1 | --devel1 </b>&lt;path&gt;

            Specifies where to find the <i>Development Package</i> associated with
            the first package to be compared.  That <i>Development Package</i> at
            <b>path </b>should at least contain header files in which public types
            exposed by the libraries (of the first package to be compared)
            are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out
            reports about ABI changes to types that are <i>NOT</i> defined in these
            header files.

          · <b>--devel-pkg2 | --devel2 </b>&lt;path&gt;

            Specifies where to find the <i>Development Package</i> associated with
            the second package to be compared.  That <i>Development Package</i> at
            <b>path </b>should at least contains header files in which public types
            exposed by the libraries (of the second package to be compared)
            are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out
            reports about ABI changes to types that are <i>NOT</i> defined in these
            header files.

          · <b>--drop-private-types</b>

            This option is to be used with the <b>--devel-pkg1 </b>and <b>--devel-pkg2</b>
            options.  With this option, types that are <i>NOT</i> defined in the
            headers are entirely dropped from the internal representation
            build by Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They thus don't have
            to be filtered out from the final ABI change report because they
            are not even present in Libabigail's representation.

            Without this option however, those private types are kept in the
            internal representation and later filtered out from the report.

            This options thus potentially makes Libabigail consume less
            memory.  It's meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory
            consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly
            defined and exported types.

          · <b>--dso-only</b>

            Compare ELF files that are shared libraries, only.  Do not
            compare executable files, for instance.

          · <b>--redundant</b>
              In the diff reports, do display redundant changes.  A
              redundant change is a change that has been displayed elsewhere
              in a given report.

          · <b>--harmless</b>

            In the diff report, display only the harmless changes.  By
            default, the harmless changes are filtered out of the diff
            report keep the clutter to a minimum and have a greater chance
            to spot real ABI issues.

          · <b>--no-linkage-name</b>

            In the resulting report, do not display the linkage names of the
            added, removed, or changed functions or variables.

          · <b>--no-added-syms</b>

            Do not show the list of functions, variables, or any symbol that
            was added.

          · <b>--no-added-binaries</b>

            Do not show the list of binaries that got added to the second
            package.

            Please note that the presence of such added binaries is not
            considered like an ABI change by this tool; as such, it doesn't
            have any impact on the exit code of the tool.  It does only have
            an informational value.  Removed binaries are, however,
            considered as an ABI change.

          · <b>--no-abignore</b>

            Do not search the <i>package2</i> for the presence of suppression
            files.

          · <b>--no-parallel</b>

            By default, <b>abipkgdiff </b>will use all the processors it has
            available to execute concurrently.  This option tells it not to
            extract packages or run comparisons in parallel.

          · <b>--no-default-suppression</b>

            Do not load the <i>default suppression specification files</i>.

          · <b>--suppressions | --suppr </b>&lt;<i>path-to-suppressions</i>&gt;

            Use a suppression specification file located at
            <i>path-to-suppressions</i>.  Note that this option can appear multiple
            times on the command line.  In that case, all of the suppression
            specification files are taken into account.

            Please note that, by default, if this option is not provided,
            then the <i>default suppression specification files</i> are loaded .

          · <b>--linux-kernel-abi-whitelist | --lkaw </b>&lt;<i>path-to-whitelist</i>&gt;

            When comparing two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points
            to the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and
            variables that must be compared for ABI changes.  That white
            list is called a "Linux kernel ABI white list".

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison
            process.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported
            functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are
            compared.

          · <b>--lkaw-pkg </b>&lt;<i>path-to-whitelist-package</i>&gt;

            When comparing two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points
            an RPM package containining several white lists of names of ELF
            symbols of functions and variables that must be compared for ABI
            changes.  Those white lists are called "Linux kernel ABI white
            lists".

            From the content of that white list package, this program then
            chooses the appropriate Linux kernel ABI white list to consider
            when comparing the ABI of Linux kernel binaries contained in the
            Linux kernel packages provided on the command line.

            That choosen Linux kernel ABI white list contains the list of
            names of ELF symbols of functions and variables that must be
            compared for ABI changes.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present
            in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison
            process.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported
            functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are
            compared.

          · <b>--no-unreferenced-symbols</b>

            In the resulting report, do not display change information about
            function and variable symbols that are not referenced by any
            debug information.  Note that for these symbols not referenced
            by any debug information, the change information displayed is
            either added or removed symbols.

          · <b>--no-show-locs</b>
              Do not show information about where in the <i>second shared</i>
              <i>library</i> the respective type was changed.

          · <b>--no-show-relative-offset-changes</b>

            Without this option, when the offset of a data member changes,
            the change report not only mentions the older and newer offset,
            but it also mentions by how many bits the data member changes.
            With this option, the latter is not shown.

          · <b>--show-identical-binaries</b>
              Show the names of the all binaries compared, including the
              binaries whose ABI compare equal.  By default, when this
              option is not provided, only binaries with ABI changes are
              mentionned in the output.

          · <b>--fail-no-dbg</b>

            Make the program fail and return a non-zero exit code if
            couldn't read any of the debug information that comes from the
            debug info packages that were given on the command line.  If no
            debug info package were provided on the command line then this
            option is not active.

            Note that the non-zero exit code returned by the program as a
            result of this option is the constant <b>ABIDIFF_ERROR</b>.  To know
            the numerical value of that constant, please refer to the exit
            code documentation.

          · <b>--keep-tmp-files</b>

            Do not erase the temporary directory files that are created
            during the execution of the tool.

          · <b>--verbose</b>

            Emit verbose progress messages.

<h2><a id="RETURN_VALUE" href="#RETURN_VALUE"></a>RETURN VALUE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The exit code of the <b>abipkgdiff </b>command is either 0 if the ABI of the
       binaries compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if the
       tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the value of the exit code is the same as for the
       abidiff tool.
