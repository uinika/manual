       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name
       is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value
       will be escaped.

       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the <b>--add </b>option.
       If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple
       lines, a POSIX regexp <b>value_regex </b>needs to be given. Only the
       existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset. If you
       want to handle the lines that do <b>not </b>match the regex, just prepend a
       single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called
       “EXAMPLES”).

       The type specifier can be either <b>--int </b>or <b>--bool</b>, to make <i>git config</i>
       ensure that the variable(s) are of the given type and convert the
       value to the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a "true"
       or "false" string for bool), or <b>--path</b>, which does some path
       expansion (see <b>--path </b>below). If no type specifier is passed, no
       checks or transformations are performed on the value.

       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and
       repository local configuration files by default, and options
       <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local </b>and <b>--file &lt;filename&gt; </b>can be used to tell
       the command to read from only that location (see the section called
       “FILES”).

       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
       configuration file by default, and options <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--file</b>
       <b>&lt;filename&gt; </b>can be used to tell the command to write to that location
       (you can say <b>--local </b>but that is the default).

       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit
       codes are:

       ·   The section or key is invalid (ret=1),

       ·   no section or name was provided (ret=2),

       ·   the config file is invalid (ret=3),

       ·   the config file cannot be written (ret=4),

       ·   you try to unset an option which does not exist (ret=5),

       ·   you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match
           (ret=5), or

       ·   you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).

       On success, the command returns the exit code 0.

       --replace-all
           Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This replaces
           all lines matching the key (and optionally the value_regex).

       --add
           Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing
           values. This is the same as providing <i>^$</i> as the value_regex in
           <b>--replace-all</b>.

       --get
           Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a regex
           matching the value). Returns error code 1 if the key was not
           found and the last value if multiple key values were found.

       --get-all
           Like get, but returns all values for a multi-valued key.

       --get-regexp
           Like --get-all, but interprets the name as a regular expression
           and writes out the key names. Regular expression matching is
           currently case-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version
           of the key in which section and variable names are lowercased,
           but subsection names are not.

       --get-urlmatch name URL
           When given a two-part name section.key, the value for
           section.&lt;url&gt;.key whose &lt;url&gt; part matches the best to the given
           URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for section.key
           is used as a fallback). When given just the section as name, do
           so for all the keys in the section and list them. Returns error
           code 1 if no value is found.

       --global
           For writing options: write to global <b>~/.gitconfig </b>file rather
           than the repository <b>.git/config</b>, write to
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config </b>file if this file exists and the
           <b>~/.gitconfig </b>file doesn’t.

           For reading options: read only from global <b>~/.gitconfig </b>and from
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config </b>rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --system
           For writing options: write to system-wide <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</b>
           rather than the repository <b>.git/config</b>.

           For reading options: read only from system-wide
           <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig </b>rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --local
           For writing options: write to the repository <b>.git/config </b>file.
           This is the default behavior.

           For reading options: read only from the repository <b>.git/config</b>
           rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       -f config-file, --file config-file
           Use the given config file instead of the one specified by
           GIT_CONFIG.

       --blob blob
           Similar to <b>--file </b>but use the given blob instead of a file. E.g.
           you can use <i>master:.gitmodules</i> to read values from the file
           <i>.gitmodules</i> in the master branch. See "SPECIFYING REVISIONS"
           section in <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a> for a more complete list of ways to
           spell blob names.

       --remove-section
           Remove the given section from the configuration file.

       --rename-section
           Rename the given section to a new name.

       --unset
           Remove the line matching the key from config file.

       --unset-all
           Remove all lines matching the key from config file.

       -l, --list
           List all variables set in config file, along with their values.

       --bool
           <i>git config</i> will ensure that the output is "true" or "false"

       --int
           <i>git config</i> will ensure that the output is a simple decimal
           number. An optional value suffix of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> in the config file
           will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or
           1073741824 prior to output.

       --bool-or-int
           <i>git config</i> will ensure that the output matches the format of
           either --bool or --int, as described above.

       --path
           <i>git-config</i> will expand leading <i>~</i> to the value of <i>$HOME</i>, and <i>~user</i>
           to the home directory for the specified user. This option has no
           effect when setting the value (but you can use <i>git config bla ~/</i>
           from the command line to let your shell do the expansion).

       -z, --null
           For all options that output values and/or keys, always end values
           with the null character (instead of a newline). Use newline
           instead as a delimiter between key and value. This allows for
           secure parsing of the output without getting confused e.g. by
           values that contain line breaks.

       --name-only
           Output only the names of config variables for <b>--list </b>or
           <b>--get-regexp</b>.

       --show-origin
           Augment the output of all queried config options with the origin
           type (file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual
           origin (config file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).

       --get-colorbool name [stdout-is-tty]
           Find the color setting for <b>name </b>(e.g.  <b>color.diff</b>) and output
           "true" or "false".  <b>stdout-is-tty </b>should be either "true" or
           "false", and is taken into account when configuration says
           "auto". If <b>stdout-is-tty </b>is missing, then checks the standard
           output of the command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is
           to be used, or exits with status 1 otherwise. When the color
           setting for <b>name </b>is undefined, the command uses <b>color.ui </b>as
           fallback.

       --get-color name [default]
           Find the color configured for <b>name </b>(e.g.  <b>color.diff.new</b>) and
           output it as the ANSI color escape sequence to the standard
           output. The optional <b>default </b>parameter is used instead, if there
           is no color configured for <b>name</b>.

       -e, --edit
           Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
           <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, or repository (default).

       --[no-]includes
           Respect <b>include.*  </b>directives in config files when looking up
           values. Defaults to <b>off </b>when a specific file is given (e.g.,
           using <b>--file</b>, <b>--global</b>, etc) and <b>on </b>when searching all config
           files.
</pre>
<h2><a id="FILES" href="#FILES"></a>FILES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If not set explicitly with <b>--file</b>, there are four files where <i>git</i>
       <i>config</i> will search for configuration options:

       $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
           System-wide configuration file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
           Second user-specific configuration file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
           not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/config </b>will be used. Any
           single-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by
           whatever is in <b>~/.gitconfig</b>. It is a good idea not to create this
           file if you sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for
           this file was added fairly recently.

       ~/.gitconfig
           User-specific configuration file. Also called "global"
           configuration file.

       $GIT_DIR/config
           Repository specific configuration file.

       If no further options are given, all reading options will read all of
       these files that are available. If the global or the system-wide
       configuration file are not available they will be ignored. If the
       repository configuration file is not available or readable, <i>git</i>
       <i>config</i> will exit with a non-zero error code. However, in neither case
       will an error message be issued.

       The files are read in the order given above, with last value found
       taking precedence over values read earlier. When multiple values are
       taken then all values of a key from all files will be used.

       You may override individual configuration parameters when running any
       git command by using the <b>-c </b>option. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for details.

       All writing options will per default write to the repository specific
       configuration file. Note that this also affects options like
       <b>--replace-all </b>and <b>--unset</b>. <i>git config</i> <b>will only ever change one file</b>
       <b>at a time</b>.

       You can override these rules either by command-line options or by
       environment variables. The <b>--global </b>and the <b>--system </b>options will
       limit the file used to the global or system-wide file respectively.
       The <b>GIT_CONFIG </b>environment variable has a similar effect, but you can
       specify any filename you want.

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT" href="#ENVIRONMENT"></a>ENVIRONMENT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       GIT_CONFIG
           Take the configuration from the given file instead of
           .git/config. Using the "--global" option forces this to
           ~/.gitconfig. Using the "--system" option forces this to
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig.

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for details.

       Given a .git/config like this:

           #
           # This is the config file, and
           # a '#' or ';' character indicates
           # a comment
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; Our diff algorithm
           [diff]
                   external = /usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper
                   renames = true

           ; Proxy settings
           [core]
                   gitproxy=proxy-command for kernel.org
                   gitproxy=default-proxy ; for all the rest

           ; HTTP
           [http]
                   sslVerify
           [http "https://weak.example.com"]
                   sslVerify = false
                   cookieFile = /tmp/cookie.txt

       you can set the filemode to true with

           % git config core.filemode true

       The hypothetical proxy command entries actually have a postfix to
       discern what URL they apply to. Here is how to change the entry for
       kernel.org to "ssh".

           % git config core.gitproxy '"ssh" for kernel.org' 'for kernel.org$'

       This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel.org is
       replaced.

       To delete the entry for renames, do

           % git config --unset diff.renames

       If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like core.gitproxy
       above), you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly one
       line.

       To query the value for a given key, do

           % git config --get core.filemode

       or

           % git config core.filemode

       or, to query a multivar:

           % git config --get core.gitproxy "for kernel.org$"

       If you want to know all the values for a multivar, do:

           % git config --get-all core.gitproxy

       If you like to live dangerously, you can replace <b>all </b>core.gitproxy by
       a new one with

           % git config --replace-all core.gitproxy ssh

       However, if you really only want to replace the line for the default
       proxy, i.e. the one without a "for ..." postfix, do something like
       this:

           % git config core.gitproxy ssh '! for '

       To actually match only values with an exclamation mark, you have to

           % git config section.key value '[!]'

       To add a new proxy, without altering any of the existing ones, use

           % git config --add core.gitproxy '"proxy-command" for example.com'

       An example to use customized color from the configuration in your
       script:

           #!/bin/sh
           WS=$(git config --get-color color.diff.whitespace "blue reverse")
           RESET=$(git config --get-color "" "reset")
           echo "${WS}your whitespace color or blue reverse${RESET}"

       For URLs in <b><a href="https://weak.example.com/">https://weak.example.com</a> </b>, <b>http.sslVerify </b>is set to false,
       while it is set to <b>true </b>for all others:

           % git config --bool --get-urlmatch http.sslverify <a href="https://good.example.com/">https://good.example.com</a>
           true
           % git config --bool --get-urlmatch http.sslverify <a href="https://weak.example.com/">https://weak.example.com</a>
           false
           % git config --get-urlmatch http <a href="https://weak.example.com/">https://weak.example.com</a>
           http.cookieFile /tmp/cookie.txt

<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION_FILE" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE"></a>CONFIGURATION FILE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect
       the Git commands' behavior. The <b>.git/config </b>file in each repository
       is used to store the configuration for that repository, and
       <b>$HOME/.gitconfig </b>is used to store a per-user configuration as
       fallback values for the <b>.git/config </b>file. The file <b>/etc/gitconfig </b>can
       be used to store a system-wide default configuration.

       The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and the
       porcelains. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the
       fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last
       dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the
       last dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only
       alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>, and must start with an alphabetic
       character. Some variables may appear multiple times; we say then that
       the variable is multivalued.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly
       ignored. The <i>#</i> and <i>;</i> characters begin comments to the end of line,
       blank lines are ignored.

       The file consists of sections and variables. A section begins with
       the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the
       next section begins. Section names are case-insensitive. Only
       alphanumeric characters, <b>- </b>and <b>. </b>are allowed in section names. Each
       variable must belong to some section, which means that there must be
       a section header before the first setting of a variable.

       Sections can be further divided into subsections. To begin a
       subsection put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the
       section name, in the section header, like in the example below:

                   [section "subsection"]

       Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters
       except newline (doublequote <b>" </b>and backslash can be included by
       escaping them as <b>\" </b>and <b>\\</b>, respectively). Section headers cannot
       span multiple lines. Variables may belong directly to a section or to
       a given subsection. You can have <b>[section] </b>if you have <b>[section</b>
       <b>"subsection"]</b>, but you don’t need to.

       There is also a deprecated <b>[section.subsection] </b>syntax. With this
       syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
       compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
       restrictions as section names.

       All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section
       header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form <i>name = value</i>
       (or just <i>name</i>, which is a short-hand to say that the variable is the
       boolean "true"). The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only
       alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>, and must start with an alphabetic
       character.

       A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by
       ending it with a <b>\</b>; the backquote and the end-of-line are stripped.
       Leading whitespaces after <i>name =</i>, the remainder of the line after the
       first comment character <i>#</i> or <i>;</i>, and trailing whitespaces of the line
       are discarded unless they are enclosed in double quotes. Internal
       whitespaces within the value are retained verbatim.

       Inside double quotes, double quote <b>" </b>and backslash <b>\ </b>characters must
       be escaped: use <b>\" </b>for <b>" </b>and <b>\\ </b>for <b>\</b>.

       The following escape sequences (beside <b>\" </b>and <b>\\</b>) are recognized: <b>\n</b>
       for newline character (NL), <b>\t </b>for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB)
       and <b>\b </b>for backspace (BS). Other char escape sequences (including
       octal escape sequences) are invalid.

   <b>Includes</b>
       The <b>include </b>and <b>includeIf </b>sections allow you to include config
       directives from another source. These sections behave identically to
       each other with the exception that <b>includeIf </b>sections may be ignored
       if their condition does not evaluate to true; see "Conditional
       includes" below.

       You can include a config file from another by setting the special
       <b>include.path </b>(or <b>includeIf.*.path</b>) variable to the name of the file
       to be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is
       subject to tilde expansion. These variables can be given multiple
       times.

       The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if
       they had been found at the location of the include directive. If the
       value of the variable is a relative path, the path is considered to
       be relative to the configuration file in which the include directive
       was found. See below for examples.

   <b>Conditional includes</b>
       You can include a config file from another conditionally by setting a
       <b>includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path </b>variable to the name of the file to be
       included.

       The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some data
       whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported keywords
       are:

       <b>gitdir</b>
           The data that follows the keyword <b>gitdir: </b>is used as a glob
           pattern. If the location of the .git directory matches the
           pattern, the include condition is met.

           The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from <b>$GIT_DIR</b>
           environment variable. If the repository is auto discovered via a
           .git file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git
           location would be the final location where the .git directory is,
           not where the .git file is.

           The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two
           additional ones, <b>**/ </b>and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple path
           components. Please refer to <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a> for details. For
           convenience:

           ·   If the pattern starts with <b>~/</b>, <b>~ </b>will be substituted with the
               content of the environment variable <b>HOME</b>.

           ·   If the pattern starts with <b>./</b>, it is replaced with the
               directory containing the current config file.

           ·   If the pattern does not start with either <b>~/</b>, <b>./ </b>or <b>/</b>, <b>**/</b>
               will be automatically prepended. For example, the pattern
               <b>foo/bar </b>becomes <b>**/foo/bar </b>and would match
               <b>/any/path/to/foo/bar</b>.

           ·   If the pattern ends with <b>/</b>, <b>** </b>will be automatically added.
               For example, the pattern <b>foo/ </b>becomes <b>foo/**</b>. In other words,
               it matches "foo" and everything inside, recursively.

       <b>gitdir/i</b>
           This is the same as <b>gitdir </b>except that matching is done
           case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file sytems)

       A few more notes on matching via <b>gitdir </b>and <b>gitdir/i</b>:

       ·   Symlinks in <b>$GIT_DIR </b>are not resolved before matching.

       ·   Both the symlink &amp; realpath versions of paths will be matched
           outside of <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to
           /mnt/storage/git, both <b>gitdir:~/git </b>and <b>gitdir:/mnt/storage/git</b>
           will match.

           This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in
           v2.13.0, which only matched the realpath version. Configuration
           that wants to be compatible with the initial release of this
           feature needs to either specify only the realpath version, or
           both versions.

       ·   Note that "../" is not special and will match literally, which is
           unlikely what you want.

                   path = foo.inc

   <b>Values</b>
       Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there
       are variables that take values of specific types and there are rules
       as to how to spell them.

       boolean
           When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many synonyms
           are accepted for <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>; these are all case-insensitive.

           true
               Boolean true can be spelled as <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>true</b>, or <b>1</b>. Also, a
               variable defined without <b>= &lt;value&gt; </b>is taken as true.

           false
               Boolean false can be spelled as <b>no</b>, <b>off</b>, <b>false</b>, or <b>0</b>.

               When converting value to the canonical form using <b>--bool </b>type
               specifier; <i>git config</i> will ensure that the output is "true"
               or "false" (spelled in lowercase).

       integer
           The value for many variables that specify various sizes can be
           suffixed with <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>,... to mean "scale the number by 1024", "by
           1024x1024", etc.

       color
           The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of colors
           (at most two, one for foreground and one for background) and
           attributes (as many as you want), separated by spaces.

           The basic colors accepted are <b>normal</b>, <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>,
           <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan </b>and <b>white</b>. The first color given is the
           foreground; the second is the background.

           Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use
           ANSI 256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support
           this). If your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit
           RGB values as hex, like <b>#ff0ab3</b>.

           The accepted attributes are <b>bold</b>, <b>dim</b>, <b>ul</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>,
           <b>italic</b>, and <b>strike </b>(for crossed-out or "strikethrough" letters).
           The position of any attributes with respect to the colors
           (before, after, or in between), doesn’t matter. Specific
           attributes may be turned off by prefixing them with <b>no </b>or <b>no-</b>
           (e.g., <b>noreverse</b>, <b>no-ul</b>, etc).

           An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This can
           be used to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling
           color entirely.

           For git’s pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant to be
           reset at the beginning of each item in the colored output. So
           setting <b>color.decorate.branch </b>to <b>black </b>will paint that branch
           name in a plain <b>black</b>, even if the previous thing on the same
           output line (e.g. opening parenthesis before the list of branch
           names in <b>log --decorate </b>output) is set to be painted with <b>bold </b>or
           some other attribute. However, custom log formats may do more
           complicated and layered coloring, and the negated forms may be
           useful there.

       pathname
           A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a string that
           begins with "<b>~/</b>" or "<b>~user/</b>", and the usual tilde expansion
           happens to such a string: <b>~/ </b>is expanded to the value of <b>$HOME</b>,
           and <b>~user/ </b>to the specified user’s home directory.

   <b>Variables</b>
       Note that this list is non-comprehensive and not necessarily
       complete. For command-specific variables, you will find a more
       detailed description in the appropriate manual page.

       Other git-related tools may and do use their own variables. When
       inventing new variables for use in your own tool, make sure their
       names do not conflict with those that are used by Git itself and
       other popular tools, and describe them in your documentation.

       advice.*
           These variables control various optional help messages designed
           to aid new users. All <i>advice.*</i>  variables default to <i>true</i>, and
           you can tell Git that you do not need help by setting these to
           <i>false</i>:

           pushUpdateRejected
               Set this variable to <i>false</i> if you want to disable
               <i>pushNonFFCurrent</i>, <i>pushNonFFMatching</i>, <i>pushAlreadyExists</i>,
               <i>pushFetchFirst</i>, and <i>pushNeedsForce</i> simultaneously.

               isn’t your current branch) and it resulted in a
               non-fast-forward error.

           pushAlreadyExists
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> rejects an update that does not
               qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)

           addEmbeddedRepo
               Advice on what to do when you’ve accidentally added one git
               repo inside of another.

       core.fileMode
           Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working tree is
           to be honored.

           Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is
           marked as executable is checked out, or checks out a
           non-executable file with executable bit on.  <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> probe the filesystem to see if it handles the
           executable bit correctly and this variable is automatically set
           as necessary.

           A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles the
           filemode correctly, and this variable is set to <i>true</i> when
           created, but later may be made accessible from another
           environment that loses the filemode (e.g. exporting ext4 via CIFS
           mount, visiting a Cygwin created repository with Git for Windows
           or Eclipse). In such a case it may be necessary to set this
           variable to <i>false</i>. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

           The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in the
           config file).

       core.hideDotFiles
           (Windows-only) If true, mark newly-created directories and files
           whose name starts with a dot as hidden. If <i>dotGitOnly</i>, only the
           <b>.git/ </b>directory is hidden, but no other files starting with a
           dot. The default mode is <i>dotGitOnly</i>.

       core.ignoreCase
           If true, this option enables various workarounds to enable Git to
           work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like FAT.
           For example, if a directory listing finds "makefile" when Git
           expects "Makefile", Git will assume it is really the same file,
           and continue to remember it as "Makefile".

           The default is false, except <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> will
           probe and set core.ignoreCase true if appropriate when the
           repository is created.

       core.precomposeUnicode
           This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git. When
           core.precomposeUnicode=true, Git reverts the unicode
           decomposition of filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful when
           sharing a repository between Mac OS and Linux or Windows. (Git
           for Windows 1.7.10 or higher is needed, or Git under cygwin 1.7).
           When false, file names are handled fully transparent by Git,
           which is backward compatible with older versions of Git.

       core.protectHFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would be
           considered equivalent to <b>.git </b>on an HFS+ filesystem. Defaults to
           <b>true </b>on Mac OS, and <b>false </b>elsewhere.

       core.protectNTFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would cause
           problems with the NTFS filesystem, e.g. conflict with 8.3 "short"
           names. Defaults to <b>true </b>on Windows, and <b>false </b>elsewhere.

       core.trustctime
           If false, the ctime differences between the index and the working
           tree are ignored; useful when the inode change time is regularly
           modified by something outside Git (file system crawlers and some
           backup systems). See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>. True by default.

       core.splitIndex
           If true, the split-index feature of the index will be used. See
           <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>. False by default.

       core.untrackedCache
           Determines what to do about the untracked cache feature of the
           index. It will be kept, if this variable is unset or set to <b>keep</b>.
           It will automatically be added if set to <b>true</b>. And it will
           automatically be removed, if set to <b>false</b>. Before setting it to
           <b>true</b>, you should check that mtime is working properly on your
           system. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.  <b>keep </b>by default.

       core.checkStat
           Determines which stat fields to match between the index and work
           tree. The user can set this to <i>default</i> or <i>minimal</i>. Default (or
           explicitly <i>default</i>), is to check all fields, including the
           sub-second part of mtime and ctime.

       core.quotePath
           Commands that output paths (e.g.  <i>ls-files</i>, <i>diff</i>), will quote
           "unusual" characters in the pathname by enclosing the pathname in
           double-quotes and escaping those characters with backslashes in
           the same way C escapes control characters (e.g.  <b>\t </b>for TAB, <b>\n</b>
           for LF, <b>\\ </b>for backslash) or bytes with values larger than 0x80
           (e.g. octal <b>\302\265 </b>for "micro" in UTF-8). If this variable is
           set to false, bytes higher than 0x80 are not considered "unusual"
           any more. Double-quotes, backslash and control characters are
           always escaped regardless of the setting of this variable. A
           simple space character is not considered "unusual". Many commands
           can output pathnames completely verbatim using the <b>-z </b>option. The
           default value is true.

       core.eol
           Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory for
           files that have the <b>text </b>property set when core.autocrlf is
           false. Alternatives are <i>lf</i>, <i>crlf</i> and <i>native</i>, which uses the
           platform’s native line ending. The default value is <b>native</b>. See
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for more information on end-of-line conversion.

       core.safecrlf
           If true, makes Git check if converting <b>CRLF </b>is reversible when
           end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a command
           modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly.
           For example, committing a file followed by checking out the same
           file should yield the original file in the work tree. If this is
           not the case for the current setting of <b>core.autocrlf</b>, Git will
           reject the file. The variable can be set to "warn", in which case
           Git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue
           the operation.

           CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data. When it
           is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to
           CRLF during checkout. A file that contains a mixture of LF and
           CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated by Git. For text files
           this is the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that
           we have only LF line endings in the repository. But for binary
           files that are accidentally classified as text the conversion can
           corrupt data.

           If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by
           setting the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes. Right
           after committing you still have the original file in your work
           tree and this file is not yet corrupted. You can explicitly tell
           Git that this file is binary and Git will handle the file
           appropriately.

           Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with
           mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary
           files cannot be distinguished. In both cases CRLFs are removed in
           an irreversible way. For text files this is the right thing to do
           because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting
           CRLFs corrupts data.

           Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will
           generate a file identical to the original file for a different
           setting of <b>core.eol </b>and <b>core.autocrlf</b>, but only for the current
           one. For example, a text file with <b>LF </b>would be accepted with
           <b>core.eol=lf </b>and could later be checked out with <b>core.eol=crlf</b>, in
           which case the resulting file would contain <b>CRLF</b>, although the
           original file contained <b>LF</b>. However, in both work trees the line
           endings would be consistent, that is either all <b>LF </b>or all <b>CRLF</b>,
           but never mixed. A file with mixed line endings would be reported
           by the <b>core.safecrlf </b>mechanism.

       core.autocrlf
           Setting this variable to "true" is the same as setting the <b>text</b>
           attribute to "auto" on all files and core.eol to "crlf". Set to
           true if you want to have <b>CRLF </b>line endings in your working
           directory and the repository has LF line endings. This variable
           can be set to <i>input</i>, in which case no output conversion is
           performed.

       core.symlinks
           If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files
           that contain the link text.  <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a> and <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>
           will not change the recorded type to regular file. Useful on
           filesystems like FAT that do not support symbolic links.

           The default is true, except <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> will
           probe and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when the
           repository is created.

       core.gitProxy
           A "proxy command" to execute (as <i>command host port</i>) instead of
           establishing direct connection to the remote server when using
           the Git protocol for fetching. If the variable value is in the
           "COMMAND for DOMAIN" format, the command is applied only on
           hostnames ending with the specified domain string. This variable
           may be set multiple times and is matched in the given order; the
           first match wins.

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_COMMAND </b>environment variable
           (which always applies universally, without the special "for"
           handling).

           The special string <b>none </b>can be used as the proxy command to
           specify that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern. This is
           useful for excluding servers inside a firewall from proxy use,
           while defaulting to a common proxy for external domains.

       core.sshCommand
           If this variable is set, <b>git fetch </b>and <b>git push </b>will use the
           specified command instead of <b>ssh </b>when they need to connect to a
           remote system. The command is in the same form as the
           <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND </b>environment variable and is overridden when the
           environment variable is set.

       core.ignoreStat
           If true, Git will avoid using lstat() calls to detect if files
           have changed by setting the "assume-unchanged" bit for those
           tracked files which it has updated identically in both the index
           and working tree.

           When files are modified outside of Git, the user will need to
           stage the modified files explicitly (e.g. see <i>Examples</i> section in
           <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>). Git will not normally detect changes to
           those files.

           This is useful on systems where lstat() calls are very slow, such
           as CIFS/Microsoft Windows.

           False by default.

       core.preferSymlinkRefs
           Instead of the default "symref" format for HEAD and other
           symbolic reference files, use symbolic links. This is sometimes
           needed to work with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a symbolic
           link.

       core.bare
           If true this repository is assumed to be <i>bare</i> and has no working
           directory associated with it. If this is the case a number of
           commands that require a working directory will be disabled, such
           as <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> or <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a>.

           This setting is automatically guessed by <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> when the repository was created. By default a
           repository that ends in "/.git" is assumed to be not bare (bare =
           false), while all other repositories are assumed to be bare (bare
           = true).

       core.worktree
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. If <b>GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
           environment variable is set, core.worktree is ignored and not
           used for determining the root of working tree. This can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_WORK_TREE </b>environment variable and the
           <b>--work-tree </b>command-line option. The value can be an absolute
           path or relative to the path to the .git directory, which is
           either specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR, or automatically
           discovered. If --git-dir or GIT_DIR is specified but none of
           --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is specified, the
           current working directory is regarded as the top level of your
           working tree.

           Note that this variable is honored even when set in a
           configuration file in a ".git" subdirectory of a directory and
           its value differs from the latter directory (e.g.
           "/path/to/.git/config" has core.worktree set to
           "/different/path"), which is most likely a misconfiguration.
           Running Git commands in the "/path/to" directory will still use
           "/different/path" as the root of the work tree and can cause
           confusion unless you know what you are doing (e.g. you are
           creating a read-only snapshot of the same index to a location
           different from the repository’s usual working tree).

       core.logAllRefUpdates
           Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged to the file
           "<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>", by appending the new and old SHA-1, the
           date/time and the reason of the update, but only when the file
           exists. If this configuration variable is set to <b>true</b>, missing
           "<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>" file is automatically created for branch
           heads (i.e. under <b>refs/heads/</b>), remote refs (i.e. under
           <b>refs/remotes/</b>), note refs (i.e. under <b>refs/notes/</b>), and the
           symbolic ref <b>HEAD</b>. If it is set to <b>always</b>, then a missing reflog
           is automatically created for any ref under <b>refs/</b>.

           This information can be used to determine what commit was the tip
           of a branch "2 days ago".

           This value is true by default in a repository that has a working
           directory associated with it, and false by default in a bare
           repository.

       core.repositoryFormatVersion
           Internal variable identifying the repository format and layout
           version.

       core.sharedRepository
           When <i>group</i> (or <i>true</i>), the repository is made shareable between
           several users in a group (making sure all the files and objects
           are group-writable). When <i>all</i> (or <i>world</i> or <i>everybody</i>), the
           repository will be readable by all users, additionally to being
           group-shareable. When <i>umask</i> (or <i>false</i>), Git will use permissions
           reported by umask(2). When <i>0xxx</i>, where <i>0xxx</i> is an octal number,
           files in the repository will have this mode value.  <i>0xxx</i> will
           override user’s umask value (whereas the other options will only
           override requested parts of the user’s umask value). Examples:
           <i>0660</i> will make the repo read/write-able for the owner and group,
           but inaccessible to others (equivalent to <i>group</i> unless umask is
           e.g.  <i>0022</i>).  <i>0640</i> is a repository that is group-readable but not
           group-writable. See <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>. False by default.

       core.warnAmbiguousRefs
           If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is
           ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the repository. True
           by default.

       core.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level. -1 is
           the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various
           speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, this provides a
           default to other compression variables, such as
           <b>core.looseCompression </b>and <b>pack.compression</b>.

       core.looseCompression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects
           that are not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
           compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being
           slowest. If not set, defaults to core.compression. If that is not
           set, defaults to 1 (best speed).

       core.packedGitWindowSize
           Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a single
           mapping operation. Larger window sizes may allow your system to
           process a smaller number of large pack files more quickly.
           Smaller window sizes will negatively affect performance due to
           increased calls to the operating system’s memory manager, but may
           improve performance when accessing a large number of large pack
           files.

           Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time, otherwise 32
           MiB on 32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This
           should be reasonable for all users/operating systems. You
           probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.packedGitLimit
           Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory from
           pack files. If Git needs to access more than this many bytes at
           once to complete an operation it will unmap existing regions to
           reclaim virtual address space within the process.

           Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 32 TiB (effectively
           unlimited) on 64 bit platforms. This should be reasonable for all
           users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You
           probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.deltaBaseCacheLimit
           Maximum number of bytes to reserve for caching base objects that
           may be referenced by multiple deltified objects. By storing the
           entire decompressed base objects in a cache Git is able to avoid
           unpacking and decompressing frequently used base objects multiple
           times.

           Default is 96 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable for
           all users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You
           probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.bigFileThreshold
           Files larger than this size are stored deflated, without
           attempting delta compression. Storing large files without delta
           compression avoids excessive memory usage, at the slight expense
           of increased disk usage. Additionally files larger than this size
           are always treated as binary.

           Default is 512 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable
           for most projects as source code and other text files can still
           be delta compressed, but larger binary media files won’t be.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.excludesFile
           Specifies the pathname to the file that contains patterns to
           describe paths that are not meant to be tracked, in addition to
           <i>.gitignore</i> (per-directory) and <i>.git/info/exclude</i>. Defaults to
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME </b>is either not
           set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore </b>is used instead. See
           <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>.

       core.askPass
           Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively
           ask for a password can be told to use an external program given
           via the value of this variable. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_ASKPASS </b>environment variable. If not set, fall back to the
           value of the <b>SSH_ASKPASS </b>environment variable or, failing that, a
           simple password prompt. The external program shall be given a
           suitable prompt as command-line argument and write the password
           on its STDOUT.

       core.attributesFile
           In addition to <i>.gitattributes</i> (per-directory) and
           <i>.git/info/attributes</i>, Git looks into this file for attributes
           (see <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>). Path expansions are made the same way as
           for <b>core.excludesFile</b>. Its default value is
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME </b>is either
           not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/attributes </b>is used instead.

       core.hooksPath
           By default Git will look for your hooks in the <i>$GIT_DIR/hooks</i>
           directory. Set this to different path, e.g.  <i>/etc/git/hooks</i>, and
           Git will try to find your hooks in that directory, e.g.
           <i>/etc/git/hooks/pre-receive</i> instead of in
           <i>$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive</i>.

           The path can be either absolute or relative. A relative path is
           taken as relative to the directory where the hooks are run (see
           the "DESCRIPTION" section of <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>).

           This configuration variable is useful in cases where you’d like
           to centrally configure your Git hooks instead of configuring them
           on a per-repository basis, or as a more flexible and centralized
           alternative to having an <b>init.templateDir </b>where you’ve changed
           default hooks.

       core.editor
           Commands such as <b>commit </b>and <b>tag </b>that let you edit messages by
           launching an editor use the value of this variable when it is
           set, and the environment variable <b>GIT_EDITOR </b>is not set. See
           <a href="git-var.1.html">git-var(1)</a>.

       core.commentChar
           Commands such as <b>commit </b>and <b>tag </b>that let you edit messages
           consider a line that begins with this character commented, and
           removes them after the editor returns (default <i>#</i>).

           If set to "auto", <b>git-commit </b>would select a character that is not
           the beginning character of any line in existing commit messages.

       core.packedRefsTimeout
           The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to lock
           the <b>packed-refs </b>file. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means
           to try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for 1 second).

       sequence.editor
           Text editor used by <b>git rebase -i </b>for editing the rebase
           instruction file. The value is meant to be interpreted by the
           shell when it is used. It can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR </b>environment variable. When not configured the
           default commit message editor is used instead.

       core.pager
           Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., <i>less</i>). The value is
           meant to be interpreted by the shell. The order of preference is
           the <b>$GIT_PAGER </b>environment variable, then <b>core.pager</b>
           configuration, then <b>$PAGER</b>, and then the default chosen at
           compile time (usually <i>less</i>).

           When the <b>LESS </b>environment variable is unset, Git sets it to <b>FRX</b>
           (if <b>LESS </b>environment variable is set, Git does not change it at
           all). If you want to selectively override Git’s default setting
           for <b>LESS</b>, you can set <b>core.pager </b>to e.g.  <b>less -S</b>. This will be
           passed to the shell by Git, which will translate the final
           command to <b>LESS=FRX less -S</b>. The environment does not set the <b>S</b>
           option but the command line does, instructing less to truncate
           long lines. Similarly, setting <b>core.pager </b>to <b>less -+F </b>will
           deactivate the <b>F </b>option specified by the environment from the
           command-line, deactivating the "quit if one screen" behavior of
           <b>less</b>. One can specifically activate some flags for particular
           commands: for example, setting <b>pager.blame </b>to <b>less -S </b>enables
           line truncation only for <b>git blame</b>.

           Likewise, when the <b>LV </b>environment variable is unset, Git sets it
           to <b>-c</b>. You can override this setting by exporting <b>LV </b>with another
           value or setting <b>core.pager </b>to <b>lv +c</b>.

       core.whitespace
           A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to notice.
           <i>git diff</i> will use <b>color.diff.whitespace </b>to highlight them, and
           <i>git apply --whitespace=error</i> will consider them as errors. You
           can prefix <b>- </b>to disable any of them (e.g.  <b>-trailing-space</b>):

           ·   <b>blank-at-eol </b>treats trailing whitespaces at the end of the
               line as an error (enabled by default).

           ·   <b>space-before-tab </b>treats a space character that appears
               immediately before a tab character in the initial indent part
               of the line as an error (enabled by default).

           ·   <b>indent-with-non-tab </b>treats a line that is indented with space
               characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an error (not
               enabled by default).

           ·   <b>tab-in-indent </b>treats a tab character in the initial indent
               part of the line as an error (not enabled by default).

           ·   <b>blank-at-eof </b>treats blank lines added at the end of file as
               an error (enabled by default).

           ·   <b>trailing-space </b>is a short-hand to cover both <b>blank-at-eol </b>and
               <b>blank-at-eof</b>.

           ·   <b>cr-at-eol </b>treats a carriage-return at the end of line as part
               of the line terminator, i.e. with it, <b>trailing-space </b>does not
               trigger if the character before such a carriage-return is not
               a whitespace (not enabled by default).

           ·   <b>tabwidth=&lt;n&gt; </b>tells how many character positions a tab
               occupies; this is relevant for <b>indent-with-non-tab </b>and when
               Git fixes <b>tab-in-indent </b>errors. The default tab width is 8.
               Allowed values are 1 to 63.

       core.fsyncObjectFiles
           This boolean will enable <i>fsync()</i> when writing object files.

           This is a total waste of time and effort on a filesystem that
           orders data writes properly, but can be useful for filesystems
           that do not use journalling (traditional UNIX filesystems) or
           that only journal metadata and not file contents (OS X’s HFS+, or
           Linux ext3 with "data=writeback").

       core.preloadIndex
           Enable parallel index preload for operations like <i>git diff</i>

           This can speed up operations like <i>git diff</i> and <i>git status</i>
           especially on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching
           semantics and thus relatively high IO latencies. When enabled,
           Git will do the index comparison to the filesystem data in
           parallel, allowing overlapping IO’s. Defaults to true.

       core.createObject
           You can set this to <i>link</i>, in which case a hardlink followed by a
           delete of the source are used to make sure that object creation
           will not overwrite existing objects.

           On some file system/operating system combinations, this is
           unreliable. Set this config setting to <i>rename</i> there; However,
           This will remove the check that makes sure that existing object
           files will not get overwritten.

       core.notesRef
           When showing commit messages, also show notes which are stored in
           the given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If the given ref
           does not exist, it is not an error but means that no notes should
           be printed.

           This setting defaults to "refs/notes/commits", and it can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_NOTES_REF </b>environment variable. See
           <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a>.

       core.sparseCheckout
           Enable "sparse checkout" feature. See section "Sparse checkout"
           in <a href="git-read-tree.1.html">git-read-tree(1)</a> for more information.

       core.abbrev
           Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If unspecified or
           set to "auto", an appropriate value is computed based on the
           approximate number of packed objects in your repository, which
           hopefully is enough for abbreviated object names to stay unique
           for some time. The minimum length is 4.

       add.ignoreErrors, add.ignore-errors (deprecated)
           Tells <i>git add</i> to continue adding files when some files cannot be
           added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the <b>--ignore-errors</b>
           option of <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>.  <b>add.ignore-errors </b>is deprecated, as it
           does not follow the usual naming convention for configuration
           variables.

       alias.*
           Command aliases for the <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> command wrapper - e.g. after
           defining "alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD", the invocation "git
           last" is equivalent to "git cat-file commit HEAD". To avoid
           confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide
           existing Git commands are ignored. Arguments are split by spaces,
           the usual shell quoting and escaping is supported. A quote pair
           or a backslash can be used to quote them.

           If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it
           will be treated as a shell command. For example, defining
           "alias.new = !gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD", the invocation "git
           new" is equivalent to running the shell command "gitk --all --not
           ORIG_HEAD". Note that shell commands will be executed from the
           top-level directory of a repository, which may not necessarily be
           the current directory.  <b>GIT_PREFIX </b>is set as returned by running
           <i>git rev-parse --show-prefix</i> from the original current directory.
           See <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.

       am.keepcr
           If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in mbox
           format with parameter <b>--keep-cr</b>. In this case git-mailsplit will
           not remove <b>\r </b>from lines ending with <b>\r\n</b>. Can be overridden by
           giving <b>--no-keep-cr </b>from the command line. See <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>,
           <a href="git-mailsplit.1.html">git-mailsplit(1)</a>.

       am.threeWay
           By default, <b>git am </b>will fail if the patch does not apply cleanly.
           When set to true, this setting tells <b>git am </b>to fall back on 3-way
           merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed
           to apply to and we have those blobs available locally (equivalent
           to giving the <b>--3way </b>option from the command line). Defaults to
           <b>false</b>. See <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>.

       apply.ignoreWhitespace
           When set to <i>change</i>, tells <i>git apply</i> to ignore changes in
           whitespace, in the same way as the <b>--ignore-space-change </b>option.
           When set to one of: no, none, never, false tells <i>git apply</i> to
           respect all whitespace differences. See <a href="git-apply.1.html">git-apply(1)</a>.

       apply.whitespace
           Tells <i>git apply</i> how to handle whitespaces, in the same way as the
           <b>--whitespace </b>option. See <a href="git-apply.1.html">git-apply(1)</a>.

       branch.autoSetupMerge
           Tells <i>git branch</i> and <i>git checkout</i> to set up new branches so that
           <a href="git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a> will appropriately merge from the starting point
           branch. Note that even if this option is not set, this behavior
           can be chosen per-branch using the <b>--track </b>and <b>--no-track</b>
           options. The valid settings are: <b>false </b>— no automatic setup is
           done; <b>true </b>— automatic setup is done when the starting point is a
           remote-tracking branch; <b>always </b>—  automatic setup is done when
           the starting point is either a local branch or remote-tracking
           branch. This option defaults to true.

       branch.autoSetupRebase
           When a new branch is created with <i>git branch</i> or <i>git checkout</i> that
           tracks another branch, this variable tells Git to set up pull to
           rebase instead of merge (see "branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase"). When <b>never</b>,
           rebase is never automatically set to true. When <b>local</b>, rebase is
           set to true for tracked branches of other local branches. When
           <b>remote</b>, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
           remote-tracking branches. When <b>always</b>, rebase will be set to true
           for all tracking branches. See "branch.autoSetupMerge" for
           details on how to set up a branch to track another branch. This
           option defaults to never.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote
           When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git push</i> which
           remote to fetch from/push to. The remote to push to may be
           overridden with <b>remote.pushDefault </b>(for all branches). The remote
           to push to, for the current branch, may be further overridden by
           <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</b>. If no remote is configured, or if you
           are not on any branch, it defaults to <b>origin </b>for fetching and
           <b>remote.pushDefault </b>for pushing. Additionally, <b>.  </b>(a period) is
           the current local repository (a dot-repository), see
           <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b>'s final note below.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote
           When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote </b>for
           pushing. It also overrides <b>remote.pushDefault </b>for pushing from
           branch &lt;name&gt;. When you pull from one place (e.g. your upstream)
           and push to another place (e.g. your own publishing repository),
           you would want to set <b>remote.pushDefault </b>to specify the remote to
           push to for all branches, and use this option to override it for
           a specific branch.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge
           Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the upstream branch
           for the given branch. It tells <i>git fetch</i>/<i>git pull</i>/<i>git rebase</i>
           which branch to merge and can also affect <i>git push</i> (see
           push.default). When in branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git fetch</i> the
           default refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value
           is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a
           ref which is fetched from the remote given by
           "branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote". The merge information is used by <i>git pull</i>
           (which at first calls <i>git fetch</i>) to lookup the default branch for
           merging. Without this option, <i>git pull</i> defaults to merge the
           first refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus
           merge. If you wish to setup <i>git pull</i> so that it merges into
           &lt;name&gt; from another branch in the local repository, you can point
           branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the desired branch, and use the relative
           path setting <b>.  </b>(a period) for branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions
           Sets default options for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The syntax
           and supported options are the same as those of <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a>, but
           option values containing whitespace characters are currently not
           supported.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase
           When true, rebase the branch &lt;name&gt; on top of the fetched branch,
           instead of merging the default branch from the default remote
           when "git pull" is run. See "pull.rebase" for doing this in a non
           branch-specific manner.

           When preserve, also pass <b>--preserve-merges </b>along to <i>git rebase</i> so
           that locally committed merge commits will not be flattened by
           running <i>git pull</i>.

           When the value is <b>interactive</b>, the rebase is run in interactive
           mode.

           <b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not </b>use it
           unless you understand the implications (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for
           details).

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.description
           Branch description, can be edited with <b>git branch</b>
           <b>--edit-description</b>. Branch description is automatically added in
           the format-patch cover letter or request-pull summary.

       browser.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified browser. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the URLs passed as
           arguments. (See <a href="git-web--browse.1.html">git-web--browse(1)</a>.)

       browser.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to browse
           HTML help (see <b>-w </b>option in <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>) or a working repository
           in gitweb (see <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>).

       clean.requireForce
           A boolean to make git-clean do nothing unless given -f, -i or -n.
           Defaults to true.

       color.branch
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of <a href="git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a>.
           May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in
           which case colors are used only when the output is to a terminal.
           If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for branch coloration.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>is one of
           <b>current </b>(the current branch), <b>local </b>(a local branch), <b>remote </b>(a
           remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/), <b>upstream </b>(upstream
           tracking branch), <b>plain </b>(other refs).

       color.diff
           Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to patches. If
           this is set to <b>always</b>, <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>, <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, and <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>
           will use color for all patches. If it is set to <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>,
           those commands will only use color when output is to the
           terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by
           default).

           This does not affect <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a> or the <i>git-diff-*</i>
           plumbing commands. Can be overridden on the command line with the
           <b>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] </b>option.

       color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for diff colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>specifies
           which part of the patch to use the specified color, and is one of
           <b>context </b>(context text - <b>plain </b>is a historical synonym), <b>meta</b>
           (metainformation), <b>frag </b>(hunk header), <i>func</i> (function in hunk
           header), <b>old </b>(removed lines), <b>new </b>(added lines), <b>commit </b>(commit
           headers), or <b>whitespace </b>(highlighting whitespace errors).

       color.decorate.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for <i>git log --decorate</i> output.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>is
           one of <b>branch</b>, <b>remoteBranch</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>stash </b>or <b>HEAD </b>for local
           branches, remote-tracking branches, tags, stash and HEAD,
           respectively.

       color.grep
           When set to <b>always</b>, always highlight matches. When <b>false </b>(or
           <b>never</b>), never. When set to <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>, use color only when the
           output is written to the terminal. If unset, then the value of
           <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.grep.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for grep colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>specifies
           which part of the line to use the specified color, and is one of

           <b>context</b>
               non-matching text in context lines (when using <b>-A</b>, <b>-B</b>, or <b>-C</b>)

           <b>filename</b>
               filename prefix (when not using <b>-h</b>)

           <b>function</b>
               function name lines (when using <b>-p</b>)

           <b>linenumber</b>
               line number prefix (when using <b>-n</b>)

           <b>match</b>
               matching text (same as setting <b>matchContext </b>and
               <b>matchSelected</b>)

           <b>matchContext</b>
               matching text in context lines

           <b>matchSelected</b>
               matching text in selected lines

           <b>selected</b>
               non-matching text in selected lines

           <b>separator</b>
               separators between fields on a line (<b>:</b>, <b>-</b>, and <b>=</b>) and between
               hunks (<b>--</b>)

       color.interactive
           When set to <b>always</b>, always use colors for interactive prompts and
           displays (such as those used by "git-add --interactive" and
           "git-clean --interactive"). When false (or <b>never</b>), never. When
           set to <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>, use colors only when the output is to the
           terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by
           default).

       color.interactive.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for <i>git add --interactive</i> and <i>git clean</i>
           <i>--interactive</i> output.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>may be <b>prompt</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>help </b>or
           <b>error</b>, for four distinct types of normal output from interactive
           commands.

       color.pager
           A boolean to enable/disable colored output when the pager is in
           use (default is true).

       color.showBranch
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
           <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>. May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or
           <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are used only when the
           output is to a terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is
           used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.status
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>.
           May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in
           which case colors are used only when the output is to a terminal.
           If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.status.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for status colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>is one of
           <b>header </b>(the header text of the status message), <b>added </b>or <b>updated</b>
           (files which are added but not committed), <b>changed </b>(files which
           are changed but not added in the index), <b>untracked </b>(files which
           are not tracked by Git), <b>branch </b>(the current branch), <b>nobranch</b>
           (the color the <i>no branch</i> warning is shown in, defaulting to red),
           <b>localBranch </b>or <b>remoteBranch </b>(the local and remote branch names,
           respectively, when branch and tracking information is displayed
           in the status short-format), or <b>unmerged </b>(files which have
           unmerged changes).

       color.ui
           This variable determines the default value for variables such as
           <b>color.diff </b>and <b>color.grep </b>that control the use of color per
           command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn
           configuration to set a default for the <b>--color </b>option. Set it to
           <b>false </b>or <b>never </b>if you prefer Git commands not to use color unless
           enabled explicitly with some other configuration or the <b>--color</b>
           option. Set it to <b>always </b>if you want all output not intended for
           machine consumption to use color, to <b>true </b>or <b>auto </b>(this is the
           default since Git 1.8.4) if you want such output to use color
           when written to the terminal.

       column.ui
           Specify whether supported commands should output in columns. This
           variable consists of a list of tokens separated by spaces or
           commas:

           These options control when the feature should be enabled
           (defaults to <i>never</i>):

           <b>always</b>
               always show in columns

           <b>never</b>
               never show in columns

           <b>auto</b>
               show in columns if the output is to the terminal

           These options control layout (defaults to <i>column</i>). Setting any of
           these implies <i>always</i> if none of <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>, or <i>auto</i> are
           specified.

           <b>column</b>
               fill columns before rows

           <b>row</b>
               fill rows before columns

           <b>plain</b>
               show in one column

           Finally, these options can be combined with a layout option
           (defaults to <i>nodense</i>):

           <b>dense</b>
               make unequal size columns to utilize more space

           <b>nodense</b>
               make equal size columns

       column.branch
           Specify whether to output branch listing in <b>git branch </b>in
           columns. See <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       column.clean
           Specify the layout when list items in <b>git clean -i</b>, which always
           shows files and directories in columns. See <b>column.ui </b>for
           details.

       column.status
           Specify whether to output untracked files in <b>git status </b>in
           columns. See <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       column.tag
           Specify whether to output tag listing in <b>git tag </b>in columns. See
           <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       commit.cleanup
           This setting overrides the default of the <b>--cleanup </b>option in <b>git</b>
           <b>commit</b>. See <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> for details. Changing the default can
           be useful when you always want to keep lines that begin with
           comment character <b># </b>in your log message, in which case you would
           do <b>git config commit.cleanup whitespace </b>(note that you will have
           to remove the help lines that begin with <b># </b>in the commit log
           template yourself, if you do this).

       commit.gpgSign
           A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed.
           Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can
           result in a large number of commits being signed. It may be
           convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase
           several times.

       commit.status
           A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in
           the commit message template when using an editor to prepare the
           commit message. Defaults to true.

       commit.template
           Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for new
           commit messages.

       commit.verbose
           A boolean or int to specify the level of verbose with <b>git commit</b>.
           See <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>.

       credential.helper
           Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
           password credential is needed; the helper may consult external
           storage to avoid prompting the user for the credentials. Note
           that multiple helpers may be defined. See <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for
           details.

       credential.useHttpPath
           When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of an
           http or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for more information.

       credential.username
           If no username is set for a network authentication, use this
           username by default. See credential.&lt;context&gt;.* below, and
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a>.

       credential.&lt;url&gt;.*
           Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively
           to some credentials. For example
           "credential.https://example.com.username" would set the default
           username only for https connections to example.com. See
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for details on how URLs are matched.

       credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP
           Tell git-credential-cache—daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of
           quitting.

       diff.autoRefreshIndex
           When using <i>git diff</i> to compare with work tree files, do not
           consider stat-only change as changed. Instead, silently run <b>git</b>
           <b>update-index --refresh </b>to update the cached stat information for
           paths whose contents in the work tree match the contents in the
           index. This option defaults to true. Note that this affects only
           <i>git diff</i> Porcelain, and not lower level <i>diff</i> commands such as <i>git</i>
           <i>diff-files</i>.

       diff.dirstat
           A comma separated list of <b>--dirstat </b>parameters specifying the
           default behavior of the <b>--dirstat </b>option to <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>` and
           friends. The defaults can be overridden on the command line
           (using <b>--dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;</b>). The fallback defaults
           (when not changed by <b>diff.dirstat</b>) are <b>changes,noncumulative,3</b>.
           The following parameters are available:

           <b>changes</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have
               been removed from the source, or added to the destination.
               This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file.
               In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as
               much as other changes. This is the default behavior when no
               parameter is given.

           <b>lines</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based
               diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts.
               (For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary
               files have no natural concept of lines). This is a more
               expensive <b>--dirstat </b>behavior than the <b>changes </b>behavior, but
               it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other
               changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
               from the other <b>--*stat </b>options.

           <b>files</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
               changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
               analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b>
               behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents
               at all.

           <b>cumulative</b>
               Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory
               as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
               percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default
               (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
               <b>noncumulative </b>parameter.

           &lt;limit&gt;
               An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
               default). Directories contributing less than this percentage
               of the changes are not shown in the output.

           Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
           directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed
           files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent
           directories: <b>files,10,cumulative</b>.

       diff.statGraphWidth
           Limit the width of the graph part in --stat output. If set,
           applies to all commands generating --stat output except
           format-patch.

       diff.context
           Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the default
           of 3. This value is overridden by the -U option.

       diff.interHunkContext
           Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number
           of lines, thereby fusing the hunks that are close to each other.
           This value serves as the default for the <b>--inter-hunk-context</b>
           command line option.

       diff.external
           If this config variable is set, diff generation is not performed
           using the internal diff machinery, but using the given command.
           Can be overridden with the ‘GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF’ environment
           variable. The command is called with parameters as described
           under "git Diffs" in <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>. Note: if you want to use an external
           diff program only on a subset of your files, you might want to
           use <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> instead.

       diff.ignoreSubmodules
           Sets the default value of --ignore-submodules. Note that this
           affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain, and not lower level <i>diff</i>
           commands such as <i>git diff-files</i>.  <i>git checkout</i> also honors this
           setting when reporting uncommitted changes. Setting it to <i>all</i>
           disables the submodule summary normally shown by <i>git commit</i> and
           <i>git status</i> when <b>status.submoduleSummary </b>is set unless it is
           overridden by using the --ignore-submodules command-line option.
           The <i>git submodule</i> commands are not affected by this setting.

       diff.mnemonicPrefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> uses a prefix pair that is different from the
           standard "a/" and "b/" depending on what is being compared. When
           this configuration is in effect, reverse diff output also swaps
           the order of the prefixes:

           <b>git diff</b>
               compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;

           <b>git diff HEAD</b>
               compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;

           <b>git diff --cached</b>
               compares a (c)ommit and the (i)ndex;

           <b>git diff HEAD:file1 file2</b>
               compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;

           <b>git diff --no-index a b</b>
               compares two non-git things (1) and (2).

       diff.noprefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> does not show any source or destination prefix.

       diff.orderFile
           File indicating how to order files within a diff. See the <i>-O</i>
           option to <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> for details. If <b>diff.orderFile </b>is a
           relative pathname, it is treated as relative to the top of the
           working tree.

       diff.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider when performing the copy/rename
           detection; equivalent to the <i>git diff</i> option <b>-l</b>.

       diff.renames
           Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to "false", rename
           detection is disabled. If set to "true", basic rename detection
           is enabled. If set to "copies" or "copy", Git will detect copies,
           as well. Defaults to true. Note that this affects only <i>git diff</i>
           Porcelain like <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> and <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, and not lower level
           commands such as <a href="git-diff-files.1.html">git-diff-files(1)</a>.

       diff.suppressBlankEmpty
           A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a space
           before each empty output line. Defaults to false.

       diff.submodule
           Specify the format in which differences in submodules are shown.
           The "short" format just shows the names of the commits at the
           beginning and end of the range. The "log" format lists the
           commits in the range like <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a><b>summary </b>does. The
           "diff" format shows an inline diff of the changed contents of the
           submodule. Defaults to "short".

       diff.wordRegex
           A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what is a
           "word" when performing word-by-word difference calculations.
           Character sequences that match the regular expression are
           "words", all other characters are <b>ignorable </b>whitespace.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command
           The custom diff driver command. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
           recognize the hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be used.
           See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary
           Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat files as
           binary. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv
           The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
           text-converted version of a file. The result of the conversion is
           used to generate a human-readable diff. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for
           details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordRegex
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to split
           words in a line. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv
           Set this option to true to make the diff driver cache the text
           conversion outputs. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.tool
           Controls which diff tool is used by <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a>. This
           variable overrides the value configured in <b>merge.tool</b>. The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated
           as a custom diff tool and requires that a corresponding
           difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       diff.indentHeuristic
           Set this option to <b>true </b>to enable experimental heuristics that
           shift diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to read.

       diff.algorithm
           Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:

           <b>default</b>, <b>myers</b>
               The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
               default.

           <b>minimal</b>
               Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
               produced.

           <b>patience</b>
               Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.

           <b>histogram</b>
               This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support
               low-occurrence common elements".

       diff.wsErrorHighlight
           A comma separated list of <b>old</b>, <b>new</b>, <b>context</b>, that specifies how
           whitespace errors on lines are highlighted with
           <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>. Can be overridden by the command line
           option <b>--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</b>

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case your
           tool is not in the PATH.

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
           variables available: <i>LOCAL</i> is set to the name of the temporary
           file containing the contents of the diff pre-image and <i>REMOTE</i> is
           set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents of
           the diff post-image.

       difftool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

       fastimport.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects imported by <a href="git-fast-import.1.html">git-fast-import(1)</a> is below
           this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
           files. However if the number of imported objects equals or
           exceeds this limit then the pack will be stored as a pack.
           Storing the pack from a fast-import can make the import operation
           complete faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the
           value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit </b>is used instead.

       fetch.recurseSubmodules
           This option can be either set to a boolean value or to <i>on-demand</i>.
           Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to
           unconditionally recurse into submodules when set to true or to
           not recurse at all when set to false. When set to <i>on-demand</i> (the
           default value), fetch and pull will only recurse into a populated
           submodule when its superproject retrieves a commit that updates
           the submodule’s reference.

       fetch.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched
           objects. It will abort in the case of a malformed object or a
           broken link. The result of an abort are only dangling objects.
           Defaults to false. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b>
           is used instead.

       fetch.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer is
           below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose
           object files. However if the number of received objects equals or
           exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as a
           pack, after adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack from
           a push can make the push operation complete faster, especially on
           slow filesystems. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit</b>
           is used instead.

       fetch.prune
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the <b>--prune </b>option
           was given on the command line. See also <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b>.

       fetch.output
           Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are <b>full</b>
           and <b>compact</b>. Default value is <b>full</b>. See section OUTPUT in
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> for detail.

       format.attach
           Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for
           <i>format-patch</i>. The value can also be a double quoted string which
           will enable attachments as the default and set the value as the
           boundary. See the --attach option in <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.from
           Provides the default value for the <b>--from </b>option to format-patch.
           Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email address. If false,
           format-patch defaults to <b>--no-from</b>, using commit authors directly
           in the "From:" field of patch mails. If true, format-patch
           defaults to <b>--from</b>, using your committer identity in the "From:"
           field of patch mails and including a "From:" field in the body of
           the patch mail if different. If set to a non-boolean value,
           format-patch uses that value instead of your committer identity.
           Defaults to false.

       format.numbered
           A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in patch
           subjects. It defaults to "auto" which enables it only if there is
           more than one patch. It can be enabled or disabled for all
           messages by setting it to "true" or "false". See --numbered
           option in <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.headers
           Additional email headers to include in a patch to be submitted by
           mail. See <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.to, format.cc
           Additional recipients to include in a patch to be submitted by
           mail. See the --to and --cc options in <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.subjectPrefix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the <i>[PATCH]</i>
           subject prefix. Use this variable to change that prefix.

       format.signature
           The default for format-patch is to output a signature containing
           the Git version number. Use this variable to change that default.
           Set this variable to the empty string ("") to suppress signature
           generation.

       format.signatureFile
           Works just like format.signature except the contents of the file
           specified by this variable will be used as the signature.

       format.suffix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the suffix
           <b>.patch</b>. Use this variable to change that suffix (make sure to
           include the dot if you want it).

       format.pretty
           The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command, See
           <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>.

       format.thread
           The default threading style for <i>git format-patch</i>. Can be a
           boolean value, or <b>shallow </b>or <b>deep</b>.  <b>shallow </b>threading makes every
           mail a reply to the head of the series, where the head is chosen
           from the cover letter, the <b>--in-reply-to</b>, and the first patch
           mail, in this order.  <b>deep </b>threading makes every mail a reply to
           the previous one. A true boolean value is the same as <b>shallow</b>,
           and a false value disables threading.

       format.signOff
           A boolean value which lets you enable the <b>-s/--signoff </b>option of
           format-patch by default.  <b>Note: </b>Adding the Signed-off-by: line to
           a patch should be a conscious act and means that you certify you
           have the rights to submit this work under the same open source
           license. Please see the <i>SubmittingPatches</i> document for further
           discussion.

       format.coverLetter
           A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter when
           format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to "auto", to
           generate a cover-letter only when there’s more than one patch.

       format.outputDirectory
           Set a custom directory to store the resulting files instead of
           the current working directory.

       format.useAutoBase
           A boolean value which lets you enable the <b>--base=auto </b>option of
           format-patch by default.

       filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean
           The command which is used to convert the content of a worktree
           file to a blob upon checkin. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge
           The command which is used to convert the content of a blob object
           to a worktree file upon checkout. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for
           details.

       fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
           Allows overriding the message type (error, warn or ignore) of a
           specific message ID such as <b>missingEmail</b>.

           For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning with the message
           ID, e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer line - missing
           email" means that setting <b>fsck.missingEmail = ignore </b>will hide
           that issue.

           This feature is intended to support working with legacy
           repositories which cannot be repaired without disruptive changes.

       fsck.skipList
           The path to a sorted list of object names (i.e. one SHA-1 per
           line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should
           be ignored. This feature is useful when an established project
           should be accepted despite early commits containing errors that
           can be safely ignored such as invalid committer email addresses.
           Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting.

       gc.aggressiveDepth
           The depth parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used
           by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 50.

       gc.aggressiveWindow
           The window size parameter used in the delta compression algorithm
           used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 250.

       gc.auto
           When there are approximately more than this many loose objects in
           the repository, <b>git gc --auto </b>will pack them. Some Porcelain
           commands use this command to perform a light-weight garbage
           collection from time to time. The default value is 6700. Setting
           this to 0 disables it.

       gc.autoPackLimit
           When there are more than this many packs that are not marked with
           <b>*.keep </b>file in the repository, <b>git gc --auto </b>consolidates them
           into one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this to 0
           disables it.

       gc.autoDetach
           Make <b>git gc --auto </b>return immediately and run in background if
           the system supports it. Default is true.

       gc.logExpiry
           If the file gc.log exists, then <b>git gc --auto </b>won’t run unless
           that file is more than <i>gc.logExpiry</i> old. Default is "1.day". See
           <b>gc.pruneExpire </b>for more ways to specify its value.

       gc.packRefs
           Running <b>git pack-refs </b>in a repository renders it unclonable by
           Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP.
           This variable determines whether <i>git gc</i> runs <b>git pack-refs</b>. This
           can be set to <b>notbare </b>to enable it within all non-bare repos or
           it can be set to a boolean value. The default is <b>true</b>.

       gc.pruneExpire
           When <i>git gc</i> is run, it will call <i>prune --expire 2.weeks.ago</i>.
           Override the grace period with this config variable. The value
           "now" may be used to disable this grace period and always prune
           unreachable objects immediately, or "never" may be used to
           suppress pruning. This feature helps prevent corruption when <i>git</i>
           <i>gc</i> runs concurrently with another process writing to the
           repository; see the "NOTES" section of <a href="git-gc.1.html">git-gc(1)</a>.

       gc.worktreePruneExpire
           When <i>git gc</i> is run, it calls <i>git worktree prune --expire</i>
           <i>3.months.ago</i>. This config variable can be used to set a different
           grace period. The value "now" may be used to disable the grace
           period and prune <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees </b>immediately, or "never" may
           be used to suppress pruning.

       gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire
           <i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older than this time;
           defaults to 90 days. The value "now" expires all entries
           immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration altogether. With
           "&lt;pattern&gt;" (e.g. "refs/stash") in the middle the setting applies
           only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.

       gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable
           <i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older than this time and
           are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30 days. The
           value "now" expires all entries immediately, and "never"
           suppresses expiration altogether. With "&lt;pattern&gt;" (e.g.
           "refs/stash") in the middle, the setting applies only to the refs
           that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.

       gc.rerereResolved
           Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept for
           this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. The default is 60 days.
           See <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a>.

       gc.rerereUnresolved
           Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept for
           this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. The default is 15 days.
           See <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.commitMsgAnnotation
           Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty string to
           disable this feature. Defaults to "via git-CVS emulator".

       gitcvs.enabled
           Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this repository.
           See <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.logFile
           Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well... logs
           various stuff. See <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.usecrlfattr
           If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion
           attributes for files to determine the <b>-k </b>modes to use. If the
           attributes force Git to treat a file as text, the <b>-k </b>mode will be
           left blank so CVS clients will treat it as text. If they suppress
           text conversion, the file will be set with <i>-kb</i> mode, which
           suppresses any newline munging the client might otherwise do. If
           the attributes do not allow the file type to be determined, then
           <b>gitcvs.allBinary </b>is used. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>.

       gitcvs.allBinary
           This is used if <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr </b>does not resolve the correct
           <i>-kb</i> mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are sent to the
           client in mode <i>-kb</i>. This causes the client to treat them as
           binary files, which suppresses any newline munging it otherwise
           might do. Alternatively, if it is set to "guess", then the
           contents of the file are examined to decide if it is binary,
           similar to <b>core.autocrlf</b>.

       gitcvs.dbName
           Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information
           derived from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends on the
           used database driver, for SQLite (which is the default driver)
           this is a filename. Supports variable substitution (see
           <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details). May not contain semicolons (<b>;</b>).
           Default: <i>%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</i>

       gitcvs.dbDriver
           Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available driver for
           this here, but it might not work. git-cvsserver is tested with
           <i>DBD::SQLite</i>, reported to work with <i>DBD::Pg</i>, and reported <b>not </b>to
           work with <i>DBD::mysql</i>. Experimental feature. May not contain
           double colons (<b>:</b>). Default: <i>SQLite</i>. See <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.dbUser, gitcvs.dbPass
           Database user and password. Only useful if setting
           <b>gitcvs.dbDriver</b>, since SQLite has no concept of database users
           and/or passwords.  <i>gitcvs.dbUser</i> supports variable substitution
           (see <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details).

       gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix
           Database table name prefix. Prepended to the names of any
           database tables used, allowing a single database to be used for
           several repositories. Supports variable substitution (see
           <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details). Any non-alphabetic characters will
           be replaced with underscores.

       All gitcvs variables except for <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr </b>and
       <b>gitcvs.allBinary </b>can also be specified as
       <i>gitcvs.&lt;access_method&gt;.&lt;varname&gt;</i> (where <i>access_method</i> is one of "ext"
       and "pserver") to make them apply only for the given access method.

       gitweb.category, gitweb.description, gitweb.owner, gitweb.url
           See <a href="gitweb.1.html">gitweb(1)</a> for description.

       gitweb.avatar, gitweb.blame, gitweb.grep, gitweb.highlight,
       gitweb.patches, gitweb.pickaxe, gitweb.remote_heads,
       gitweb.showSizes, gitweb.snapshot
           See <a href="../man5/gitweb.conf.5.html">gitweb.conf(5)</a> for description.

       grep.lineNumber
           If set to true, enable <b>-n </b>option by default.

       grep.patternType
           Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of <i>basic</i>,
           <i>extended</i>, <i>fixed</i>, or <i>perl</i> will enable the <b>--basic-regexp</b>,
           <b>--extended-regexp</b>, <b>--fixed-strings</b>, or <b>--perl-regexp </b>option
           accordingly, while the value <i>default</i> will return to the default
           matching behavior.

       grep.extendedRegexp
           If set to true, enable <b>--extended-regexp </b>option by default. This
           option is ignored when the <b>grep.patternType </b>option is set to a
           value other than <i>default</i>.

       grep.threads
           Number of grep worker threads to use. See <b>grep.threads </b>in
           <a href="git-grep.1.html">git-grep(1)</a> for more information.

       grep.fallbackToNoIndex
           If set to true, fall back to git grep --no-index if git grep is
           executed outside of a git repository. Defaults to false.

       gpg.program
           Use this custom program instead of "<b>gpg</b>" found on <b>$PATH </b>when
           making or verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the
           same command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached
           signature, "<b>gpg --verify $file - &lt;$signature</b>" is run, and the
           program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with
           code 0, and to generate an ASCII-armored detached signature, the
           standard input of "<b>gpg -bsau $key</b>" is fed with the contents to be
           signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its
           standard output.

       gui.commitMsgWidth
           Defines how wide the commit message window is in the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>.
           "75" is the default.

       gui.diffContext
           Specifies how many context lines should be used in calls to diff
           made by the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>. The default is "5".

       gui.displayUntracked
           Determines if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> shows untracked files in the file list.
           The default is "true".

       gui.encoding
           Specifies the default encoding to use for displaying of file
           contents in <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> and <a href="gitk.1.html">gitk(1)</a>. It can be overridden by
           setting the <i>encoding</i> attribute for relevant files (see
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>). If this option is not set, the tools default
           to the locale encoding.

       gui.matchTrackingBranch
           Determines if new branches created with <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should default
           to tracking remote branches with matching names or not. Default:
           "false".

       gui.newBranchTemplate
           Is used as suggested name when creating new branches using the
           <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>.

       gui.pruneDuringFetch
           "true" if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should prune remote-tracking branches when
           performing a fetch. The default value is "false".

       gui.trustmtime
           Determines if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should trust the file modification
           timestamp or not. By default the timestamps are not trusted.

       gui.spellingDictionary
           Specifies the dictionary used for spell checking commit messages
           in the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>. When set to "none" spell checking is turned
           off.

       gui.fastCopyBlame
           If true, <i>git gui blame</i> uses <b>-C </b>instead of <b>-C -C </b>for original
           location detection. It makes blame significantly faster on huge
           repositories at the expense of less thorough copy detection.

       gui.copyBlameThreshold
           Specifies the threshold to use in <i>git gui blame</i> original location
           detection, measured in alphanumeric characters. See the
           <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a> manual for more information on copy detection.

       gui.blamehistoryctx
           Specifies the radius of history context in days to show in
           <a href="gitk.1.html">gitk(1)</a> for the selected commit, when the <b>Show History Context</b>
           menu item is invoked from <i>git gui blame</i>. If this variable is set
           to zero, the whole history is shown.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.cmd
           Specifies the shell command line to execute when the
           corresponding item of the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a><b>Tools </b>menu is invoked. This
           option is mandatory for every tool. The command is executed from
           the root of the working directory, and in the environment it
           receives the name of the tool as <b>GIT_GUITOOL</b>, the name of the
           currently selected file as <i>FILENAME</i>, and the name of the current
           branch as <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> (if the head is detached, <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> is
           empty).

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.needsFile
           Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees
           that <i>FILENAME</i> is not empty.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noConsole
           Run the command silently, without creating a window to display
           its output.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noRescan
           Don’t rescan the working directory for changes after the tool
           finishes execution.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.confirm
           Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argPrompt
           Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool
           through the <b>ARGS </b>environment variable. Since requesting an
           argument implies confirmation, the <i>confirm</i> option has no effect
           if this is enabled. If the option is set to <i>true</i>, <i>yes</i>, or <i>1</i>, the
           dialog uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact value
           of the variable is used.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revPrompt
           Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the
           <b>REVISION </b>environment variable. In other aspects this option is
           similar to <i>argPrompt</i>, and can be used together with it.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revUnmerged
           Show only unmerged branches in the <i>revPrompt</i> subdialog. This is
           useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for things
           like checkout or reset.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.title
           Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The default is
           the tool name.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.prompt
           Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of the
           dialog, before subsections for <i>argPrompt</i> and <i>revPrompt</i>. The
           default value includes the actual command.

       help.browser
           Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the <i>web</i>
           format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       help.format
           Override the default help format used by <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>. Values <i>man</i>,
           <i>info</i>, <i>web</i> and <i>html</i> are supported.  <i>man</i> is the default.  <i>web</i> and
           <i>html</i> are the same.

       help.autoCorrect
           Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after waiting
           for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec). If more than one
           command can be deduced from the entered text, nothing will be
           executed. If the value of this option is negative, the corrected
           command will be executed immediately. If the value is 0 - the
           command will be just shown but not executed. This is the default.

       help.htmlPath
           Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File
           system paths and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed
           with this path when help is displayed in the <i>web</i> format. This
           defaults to the documentation path of your Git installation.

       http.proxy
           Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the
           <i>http_proxy</i>, <i>https_proxy</i>, and <i>all_proxy</i> environment variables (see
           <b>curl</b>(1)). In addition to the syntax understood by curl, it is
           possible to specify a proxy string with a user name but no
           password, in which case git will attempt to acquire one in the
           same way it does for other credentials. See <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for
           more information. The syntax thus is
           <i>[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port]</i>. This can be
           overridden on a per-remote basis; see remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy

       http.proxyAuthMethod
           Set the method with which to authenticate against the HTTP proxy.
           This only takes effect if the configured proxy string contains a
           user name part (i.e. is of the form <i>user@host</i> or <i>user@host:port</i>).
           This can be overridden on a per-remote basis; see
           <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod</b>. Both can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD </b>environment variable. Possible values
           are:

           ·   <b>anyauth </b>- Automatically pick a suitable authentication
               method. It is assumed that the proxy answers an
               unauthenticated request with a 407 status code and one or
               more Proxy-authenticate headers with supported authentication
               methods. This is the default.

           ·   <b>basic </b>- HTTP Basic authentication

           ·   <b>digest </b>- HTTP Digest authentication; this prevents the
               password from being transmitted to the proxy in clear text

           ·   <b>negotiate </b>- GSS-Negotiate authentication (compare the
               --negotiate option of <b>curl</b>(1))

           ·   <b>ntlm </b>- NTLM authentication (compare the --ntlm option of
               <b>curl</b>(1))

       http.emptyAuth
           Attempt authentication without seeking a username or password.
           This can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without
           specifying a username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a
           username for authentication.

       http.delegation
           Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is disabled
           by default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set parameter to tell
           the server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user
           credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos. Possible values are:

           ·   <b>none </b>- Don’t allow any delegation.

           ·   <b>policy </b>- Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is
               set in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter of
               realm policy.

           ·   <b>always </b>- Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       http.extraHeader
           Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a server.
           If more than one such entry exists, all of them are added as
           extra headers. To allow overriding the settings inherited from
           the system config, an empty value will reset the extra headers to
           the empty list.

       http.cookieFile
           The pathname of a file containing previously stored cookie lines,
           which should be used in the Git http session, if they match the
           server. The file format of the file to read cookies from should
           be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format
           (see <b>curl</b>(1)). NOTE that the file specified with http.cookieFile
           is used only as input unless http.saveCookies is set.

       http.saveCookies
           If set, store cookies received during requests to the file
           specified by http.cookieFile. Has no effect if http.cookieFile is
           unset.

       http.sslVersion
           The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if you
           want to force the default. The available and default version
           depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and
           the particular configuration of the crypto library in use.
           Internally this sets the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION</i> option; see the
           libcurl documentation for more details on the format of this
           option and for the ssl version supported. Actually the possible
           values of this option are:

           ·   sslv2

           ·   sslv3

           ·   tlsv1

           ·   tlsv1.0

           ·   tlsv1.1

           ·   tlsv1.2

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION </b>environment variable. To
           force git to use libcurl’s default ssl version and ignore any
           explicit http.sslversion option, set <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION </b>to the empty
           string.

       http.sslCipherList
           A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL connection.
           The available ciphers depend on whether libcurl was built against
           NSS or OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto
           library in use. Internally this sets the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</i>
           option; see the libcurl documentation for more details on the
           format of this list.

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST </b>environment
           variable. To force git to use libcurl’s default cipher list and
           ignore any explicit http.sslCipherList option, set
           <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST </b>to the empty string.

       http.sslVerify
           Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing
           over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</b>
           environment variable.

       http.sslCert
           File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over
           HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CERT </b>environment
           variable.

       http.sslKey
           File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over
           HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_KEY </b>environment variable.

       http.sslCertPasswordProtected
           Enable Git’s password prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise
           OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the
           certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED </b>environment variable.

       http.sslCAInfo
           File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when
           fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_SSL_CAINFO </b>environment variable.

       http.sslCAPath
           Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer
           with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by
           the <b>GIT_SSL_CAPATH </b>environment variable.

       http.pinnedpubkey
           Public key of the https service. It may either be the filename of
           a PEM or DER encoded public key file or a string starting with
           <i>sha256//</i> followed by the base64 encoded sha256 hash of the public
           key. See also libcurl <i>CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY</i>. git will exit with
           an error if this option is set but not supported by cURL.

       http.sslTry
           Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers when
           connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed if the
           FTP server requires it for security reasons or you wish to
           connect securely whenever remote FTP server supports it. Default
           is false since it might trigger certificate verification errors
           on misconfigured servers.

       http.maxRequests
           How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be overridden
           by the <b>GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS </b>environment variable. Default is 5.

       http.minSessions
           The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be kept
           across requests. They will not be ended with curl_easy_cleanup()
           until http_cleanup() is invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not
           defined, this value will be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.

       http.postBuffer
           Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP transports
           when POSTing data to the remote system. For requests larger than
           this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used
           to avoid creating a massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB,
           which is sufficient for most requests.

       http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime
           If the HTTP transfer speed is less than <i>http.lowSpeedLimit</i> for
           longer than <i>http.lowSpeedTime</i> seconds, the transfer is aborted.
           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT </b>and
           <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME </b>environment variables.

       http.noEPSV
           A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl. This
           can helpful with some "poor" ftp servers which don’t support EPSV
           mode. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV </b>environment
           variable. Default is false (curl will use EPSV).

       http.userAgent
           The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server. The
           default value represents the version of the client Git such as
           git/1.7.1. This option allows you to override this value to a
           more common value such as Mozilla/4.0. This may be necessary, for
           instance, if connecting through a firewall that restricts HTTP
           connections to a set of common USER_AGENT strings (but not
           including those like git/1.7.1). Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT </b>environment variable.

       http.followRedirects
           Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to <b>true</b>, git
           will transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it
           encounters. If set to <b>false</b>, git will treat all redirects as
           errors. If set to <b>initial</b>, git will follow redirects only for the
           initial request to a remote, but not for subsequent follow-up
           HTTP requests. Since git uses the redirected URL as the base for
           the follow-up requests, this is generally sufficient. The default
           is <b>initial</b>.

       http.&lt;url&gt;.*
           Any of the http.* options above can be applied selectively to
           some URLs. For a config key to match a URL, each element of the
           config key is compared to that of the URL, in the following
           order:

            1. Scheme (e.g., <b>https </b>in <b><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a> </b>). This field must
               match exactly between the config key and the URL.

            2. Host/domain name (e.g., <b>example.com </b>in <b><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a> </b>).
               This field must match between the config key and the URL. It
               is possible to specify a <b>* </b>as part of the host name to match
               all subdomains at this level.  <b>https://*.example.com/ </b>for
               example would match <b><a href="https://foo.example.com/">https://foo.example.com/</a> </b>, but not
               <b><a href="https://foo.bar.example.com/">https://foo.bar.example.com/</a> </b>.

            3. Port number (e.g., <b>8080 </b>in <b><a href="http://example.com:8080/">http://example.com:8080/</a> </b>). This
               field must match exactly between the config key and the URL.
               Omitted port numbers are automatically converted to the
               correct default for the scheme before matching.

            4. Path (e.g., <b>repo.git </b>in <b><a href="https://example.com/repo.git">https://example.com/repo.git</a> </b>). The
               path field of the config key must match the path field of the
               URL either exactly or as a prefix of slash-delimited path
               elements. This means a config key with path <b>foo/ </b>matches URL
               path <b>foo/bar</b>. A prefix can only match on a slash (<b>/</b>)
               boundary. Longer matches take precedence (so a config key
               with path <b>foo/bar </b>is a better match to URL path <b>foo/bar </b>than
               a config key with just path <b>foo/</b>).

            5. User name (e.g., <b>user </b>in <b>https://user@example.com/repo.git</b>).
               If the config key has a user name it must match the user name
               in the URL exactly. If the config key does not have a user
               name, that config key will match a URL with any user name
               (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config key
               with a user name.

           The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that
           matches a config key’s path is preferred to one that matches its
           user name. For example, if the URL is
           <b>https://user@example.com/foo/bar </b>a config key match of
           <b>https://example.com/foo </b>will be preferred over a config key match
           of <b>https://user@example.com</b>.

           All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the
           password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for
           matching purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply
           spelled differently will match properly. Environment variable
           settings always override any matches. The URLs that are matched
           against are those given directly to Git commands. This means any
           URLs visited as a result of a redirection do not participate in
           matching.

       ssh.variant
           Depending on the value of the environment variables <b>GIT_SSH </b>or
           <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</b>, or the config setting <b>core.sshCommand</b>, Git
           auto-detects whether to adjust its command-line parameters for
           use with plink or tortoiseplink, as opposed to the default
           (OpenSSH).

           The config variable <b>ssh.variant </b>can be set to override this
           auto-detection; valid values are <b>ssh</b>, <b>plink</b>, <b>putty </b>or
           <b>tortoiseplink</b>. Any other value will be treated as normal ssh.
           This setting can be overridden via the environment variable
           <b>GIT_SSH_VARIANT</b>.

       i18n.commitEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git itself
           does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
           importing commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history
           browser (and possibly at other places in the future or in other
           porcelains). See e.g.  <a href="git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo(1)</a>. Defaults to <i>utf-8</i>.

       i18n.logOutputEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when
           running <i>git log</i> and friends.

       imap
           The configuration variables in the <i>imap</i> section are described in
           <a href="git-imap-send.1.html">git-imap-send(1)</a>.

       index.version
           Specify the version with which new index files should be
           initialized. This does not affect existing repositories.

       init.templateDir
           Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See
           the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>.)

       instaweb.browser
           Specify the program that will be used to browse your working
           repository in gitweb. See <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       instaweb.httpd
           The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working
           repository. See <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       instaweb.local
           If true the web server started by <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> will be bound
           to the local IP (127.0.0.1).

       instaweb.modulePath
           The default module path for <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> to use instead of
           /usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is Apache.

       instaweb.port
           The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       interactive.singleKey
           In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter
           input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter). Currently
           this is used by the <b>--patch </b>mode of <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>, <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>,
           <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>, <a href="git-reset.1.html">git-reset(1)</a>, and <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>. Note that this
           setting is silently ignored if portable keystroke input is not
           available; requires the Perl module Term::ReadKey.

       interactive.diffFilter
           When an interactive command (such as <b>git add --patch</b>) shows a
           colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell command
           defined by this configuration variable. The command may mark up
           the diff further for human consumption, provided that it retains
           a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the original diff.
           Defaults to disabled (no filtering).

       log.abbrevCommit
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>
           assume <b>--abbrev-commit</b>. You may override this option with
           <b>--no-abbrev-commit</b>.

       log.date
           Set the default date-time mode for the <i>log</i> command. Setting a
           value for log.date is similar to using <i>git log</i>'s <b>--date </b>option.
           See <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> for details.

       log.decorate
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
           command. If <i>short</i> is specified, the ref name prefixes
           <i>refs/heads/</i>, <i>refs/tags/</i> and <i>refs/remotes/</i> will not be printed. If
           <i>full</i> is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be
           printed. If <i>auto</i> is specified, then if the output is going to a
           terminal, the ref names are shown as if <i>short</i> were given,
           otherwise no ref names are shown. This is the same as the
           <b>--decorate </b>option of the <b>git log</b>.

       log.follow
           If <b>true</b>, <b>git log </b>will act as if the <b>--follow </b>option was used when
           a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has the same limitations as
           <b>--follow</b>, i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and
           does not work well on non-linear history.

       log.graphColors
           A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw
           history lines in <b>git log --graph</b>.

       log.showRoot
           If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation
           event. This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree. Tools
           like <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> or <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>, which normally hide the
           root commit will now show it. True by default.

       log.showSignature
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>
           assume <b>--show-signature</b>.

       log.mailmap
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>
           assume <b>--use-mailmap</b>.

       mailinfo.scissors
           If true, makes <a href="git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo(1)</a> (and therefore <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>) act by
           default as if the --scissors option was provided on the
           command-line. When active, this features removes everything from
           the message body before a scissors line (i.e. consisting mainly
           of "&gt;8", "8&lt;" and "-").

       mailmap.file
           The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default mailmap,
           located in the root of the repository, is loaded first, then the
           mailmap file pointed to by this variable. The location of the
           mailmap file may be in a repository subdirectory, or somewhere
           outside of the repository itself. See <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>.

       mailmap.blob
           Like <b>mailmap.file</b>, but consider the value as a reference to a
           blob in the repository. If both <b>mailmap.file </b>and <b>mailmap.blob </b>are
           given, both are parsed, with entries from <b>mailmap.file </b>taking
           precedence. In a bare repository, this defaults to <b>HEAD:.mailmap</b>.
           In a non-bare repository, it defaults to empty.

       man.viewer
           Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the <i>man</i>
           format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page passed
           as argument. (See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.)

       man.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to display
           help in the <i>man</i> format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       merge.conflictStyle
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to
           working tree files upon merge. The default is "merge", which
           shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </b>conflict marker, changes made by one side, a
           <b>======= </b>marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
           <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>marker. An alternate style, "diff3", adds a <b>|||||||</b>
           marker and the original text before the <b>======= </b>marker.

       merge.defaultToUpstream
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
           upstream branches configured for the current branch by using
           their last observed values stored in their remote-tracking
           branches. The values of the <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge </b>that
           name the branches at the remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current</b>
           <b>branch&gt;.remote </b>are consulted, and then they are mapped via
           <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch </b>to their corresponding remote-tracking
           branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are merged.

       merge.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
           merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
           Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When
           set to <b>false</b>, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge
           commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff </b>option
           from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward
           merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the <b>--ff-only </b>option
           from the command line).

       merge.branchdesc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the
           branch description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

       merge.log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at
           most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the
           actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true
           is a synonym for 20.

       merge.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider when performing rename detection
           during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the value of
           diff.renameLimit.

       merge.renormalize
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository
           has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files
           with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In
           such a repository, Git can convert the data recorded in commits
           to a canonical form before performing a merge to reduce
           unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section "Merging
           branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes" in
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>.

       merge.stat
           Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge
           result at the end of the merge. True by default.

       merge.tool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a>. The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated
           as a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       merge.verbosity
           Controls the amount of output shown by the recursive merge
           strategy. Level 0 outputs nothing except a final error message if
           conflicts were detected. Level 1 outputs only conflicts, 2
           outputs conflicts and file changes. Level 5 and above outputs
           debugging information. The default is level 2. Can be overridden
           by the <b>GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY </b>environment variable.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.name
           Defines a human-readable name for a custom low-level merge
           driver. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.driver
           Defines the command that implements a custom low-level merge
           driver. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.recursive
           Names a low-level merge driver to be used when performing an
           internal merge between common ancestors. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for
           details.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case your
           tool is not in the PATH.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
           variables available: <i>BASE</i> is the name of a temporary file
           containing the common base of the files to be merged, if
           available; <i>LOCAL</i> is the name of a temporary file containing the
           contents of the file on the current branch; <i>REMOTE</i> is the name of
           a temporary file containing the contents of the file from the
           branch being merged; <i>MERGED</i> contains the name of the file to
           which the merge tool should write the results of a successful
           merge.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode
           For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of the
           merge command can be used to determine whether the merge was
           successful. If this is not set to true then the merge target file
           timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been
           successful if the file has been updated, otherwise the user is
           prompted to indicate the success of the merge.

       mergetool.meld.hasOutput
           Older versions of <b>meld </b>do not support the <b>--output </b>option. Git
           will attempt to detect whether <b>meld </b>supports <b>--output </b>by
           inspecting the output of <b>meld --help</b>. Configuring
           <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput </b>will make Git skip these checks and use
           the configured value instead. Setting <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput </b>to
           <b>true </b>tells Git to unconditionally use the <b>--output </b>option, and
           <b>false </b>avoids using <b>--output</b>.

       mergetool.keepBackup
           After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers
           can be saved as a file with a <b>.orig </b>extension. If this variable
           is set to <b>false </b>then this file is not preserved. Defaults to <b>true</b>
           (i.e. keep the backup files).

       mergetool.keepTemporaries
           When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of temporary
           files to pass to the tool. If the tool returns an error and this
           variable is set to <b>true</b>, then these temporary files will be
           preserved, otherwise they will be removed after the tool has
           exited. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       mergetool.writeToTemp
           Git writes temporary <i>BASE</i>, <i>LOCAL</i>, and <i>REMOTE</i> versions of
           conflicting files in the worktree by default. Git will attempt to
           use a temporary directory for these files when set <b>true</b>. Defaults
           to <b>false</b>.

       mergetool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution program.

       notes.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes
           conflicts. Must be one of <b>manual</b>, <b>ours</b>, <b>theirs</b>, <b>union</b>, or
           <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>. Defaults to <b>manual</b>. See "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
           section of <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a> for more information on each strategy.

       notes.&lt;name&gt;.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into
           refs/notes/&lt;name&gt;. This overrides the more general
           "notes.mergeStrategy". See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section
           in <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a> for more information on the available strategies.

       notes.displayRef
           The (fully qualified) refname from which to show notes when
           showing commit messages. The value of this variable can be set to
           a glob, in which case notes from all matching refs will be shown.
           You may also specify this configuration variable several times. A
           warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob
           that does not match any refs is silently ignored.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b>
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of
           refs or globs.

           The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden by
           GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be
           displayed.

       notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
           When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <b>amend </b>or <b>rebase</b>)
           and this variable is set to <b>true</b>, Git automatically copies your
           notes from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to
           <b>true</b>, but see "notes.rewriteRef" below.

       notes.rewriteMode
           When copying notes during a rewrite (see the
           "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" option), determines what to do if the
           target commit already has a note. Must be one of <b>overwrite</b>,
           <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or <b>ignore</b>. Defaults to <b>concatenate</b>.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</b>
           environment variable.

       notes.rewriteRef
           When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
           qualified) ref whose notes should be copied. The ref may be a
           glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied.
           You may also specify this configuration several times.

           Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable
           to enable note rewriting. Set it to <b>refs/notes/commits </b>to enable
           rewriting for the default commit notes.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b>
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of
           refs or globs.

       pack.window
           The size of the window used by <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> when no window
           size is given on the command line. Defaults to 10.

       pack.depth
           The maximum delta depth used by <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> when no
           maximum depth is given on the command line. Defaults to 50.

       pack.windowMemory
           The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each thread in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> for pack window memory when no limit is given
           on the command line. The value can be suffixed with "k", "m", or
           "g". When left unconfigured (or set explicitly to 0), there will
           be no limit.

       pack.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects in
           a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and
           1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not
           set, defaults to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults
           to -1, the zlib default, which is "a default compromise between
           speed and compression (currently equivalent to level 6)."

           Note that changing the compression level will not automatically
           recompress all existing objects. You can force recompression by
           passing the -F option to <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       pack.deltaCacheSize
           The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> before writing them out to a pack. This cache
           is used to speed up the writing object phase by not having to
           recompute the final delta result once the best match for all
           objects is found. Repacking large repositories on machines which
           are tight with memory might be badly impacted by this though,
           especially if this cache pushes the system into swapping. A value
           of 0 means no limit. The smallest size of 1 byte may be used to
           virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.

       pack.deltaCacheLimit
           The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a>. This cache is used to speed up the writing
           object phase by not having to recompute the final delta result
           once the best match for all objects is found. Defaults to 1000.

       pack.threads
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best
           delta matches. This requires that <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> be compiled
           with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning.
           This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines.
           The required amount of memory for the delta search window is
           however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will
           cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPU’s and set the number
           of threads accordingly.

       pack.indexVersion
           Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are 1 for
           legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for
           the new pack index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB
           as well as proper protection against the repacking of corrupted
           packs. Version 2 is the default. Note that version 2 is enforced
           and this config option ignored whenever the corresponding pack is
           larger than 2 GB.

           If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2
           <b>*.idx </b>file, cloning or fetching over a non native protocol (e.g.
           "http") that will copy both <b>*.pack </b>file and corresponding <b>*.idx</b>
           file from the other side may give you a repository that cannot be
           accessed with your older version of Git. If the <b>*.pack </b>file is
           smaller than 2 GB, however, you can use <a href="git-index-pack.1.html">git-index-pack(1)</a> on the
           *.pack file to regenerate the <b>*.idx </b>file.

       pack.packSizeLimit
           The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects packing to
           a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol is unaffected. It
           can be overridden by the <b>--max-pack-size </b>option of <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.
           Reaching this limit results in the creation of multiple
           packfiles; which in turn prevents bitmaps from being created. The
           minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is
           unlimited. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       pack.useBitmaps
           When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when packing
           to stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch). Defaults to
           true. You should not generally need to turn this off unless you
           are debugging pack bitmaps.

       pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)
           This is a deprecated synonym for <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>.

       pack.writeBitmapHashCache
           When true, git will include a "hash cache" section in the bitmap
           index (if one is written). This cache can be used to feed git’s
           delta heuristics, potentially leading to better deltas between
           bitmapped and non-bitmapped objects (e.g., when serving a fetch
           between an older, bitmapped pack and objects that have been
           pushed since the last gc). The downside is that it consumes 4
           bytes per object of disk space, and that JGit’s bitmap
           implementation does not understand it, causing it to complain if
           Git and JGit are used on the same repository. Defaults to false.

       pager.&lt;cmd&gt;
           If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the output
           of a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty. Otherwise,
           turns on pagination for the subcommand using the pager specified
           by the value of <b>pager.&lt;cmd&gt;</b>. If <b>--paginate </b>or <b>--no-pager </b>is
           specified on the command line, it takes precedence over this
           option. To disable pagination for all commands, set <b>core.pager </b>or
           <b>GIT_PAGER </b>to <b>cat</b>.

       pretty.&lt;name&gt;
           Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>.
           Any aliases defined here can be used just as the built-in pretty
           formats could. For example, running <b>git config pretty.changelog</b>
           <b>"format:* %H %s" </b>would cause the invocation <b>git log</b>
           <b>--pretty=changelog </b>to be equivalent to running <b>git log</b>
           <b>"--pretty=format:* %H %s"</b>. Note that an alias with the same name
           as a built-in format will be silently ignored.

       protocol.allow
           If set, provide a user defined default policy for all protocols
           which don’t explicitly have a policy (<b>protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow</b>). By
           default, if unset, known-safe protocols (http, https, git, ssh,
           file) have a default policy of <b>always</b>, known-dangerous protocols
           (ext) have a default policy of <b>never</b>, and all other protocols
           have a default policy of <b>user</b>. Supported policies:

           ·   <b>always </b>- protocol is always able to be used.

           ·   <b>never </b>- protocol is never able to be used.

           ·   <b>user </b>- protocol is only able to be used when
               <b>GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER </b>is either unset or has a value of 1.
               This policy should be used when you want a protocol to be
               directly usable by the user but don’t want it used by
               commands which execute clone/fetch/push commands without user
               input, e.g. recursive submodule initialization.

       protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow
           Set a policy to be used by protocol <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>with clone/fetch/push
           commands. See <b>protocol.allow </b>above for the available policies.

           The protocol names currently used by git are:

           ·   <b>file</b>: any local file-based path (including <b>file:// </b>URLs, or
               local paths)

           ·   <b>git</b>: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP connection
               (or proxy, if configured)

           ·   <b>ssh</b>: git over ssh (including <b>host:path </b>syntax, <b>ssh://</b>, etc).

           ·   <b>http</b>: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http". Note
               that this does <i>not</i> include <b>https</b>; if you want to configure
               both, you must do so individually.

           ·   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use
               <b>hg </b>to allow the <b>git-remote-hg </b>helper)

       pull.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
           merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
           Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When
           set to <b>false</b>, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge
           commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff </b>option
           from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward
           merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the <b>--ff-only </b>option
           from the command line). This setting overrides <b>merge.ff </b>when
           pulling.

       pull.rebase
           When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch, instead
           of merging the default branch from the default remote when "git
           pull" is run. See "branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase" for setting this on a
           per-branch basis.

           When preserve, also pass <b>--preserve-merges </b>along to <i>git rebase</i> so
           that locally committed merge commits will not be flattened by
           running <i>git pull</i>.

           When the value is <b>interactive</b>, the rebase is run in interactive
           mode.

           <b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not </b>use it
           unless you understand the implications (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for
           details).

       pull.octopus
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple branches
           at once.

       pull.twohead
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling a single branch.

       push.default
           Defines the action <b>git push </b>should take if no refspec is
           explicitly given. Different values are well-suited for specific
           workflows; for instance, in a purely central workflow (i.e. the
           fetch source is equal to the push destination), <b>upstream </b>is
           probably what you want. Possible values are:

           ·   <b>nothing </b>- do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec
               is explicitly given. This is primarily meant for people who
               want to avoid mistakes by always being explicit.

           ·   <b>current </b>- push the current branch to update a branch with the
               same name on the receiving end. Works in both central and
               non-central workflows.

           ·   <b>upstream </b>- push the current branch back to the branch whose
               changes are usually integrated into the current branch (which
               is called <b>@{upstream}</b>). This mode only makes sense if you are
               pushing to the same repository you would normally pull from
               (i.e. central workflow).

           ·   <b>tracking </b>- This is a deprecated synonym for <b>upstream</b>.

           ·   <b>simple </b>- in centralized workflow, work like <b>upstream </b>with an
               added safety to refuse to push if the upstream branch’s name
               is different from the local one.

               When pushing to a remote that is different from the remote
               you normally pull from, work as <b>current</b>. This is the safest
               option and is suited for beginners.

               This mode has become the default in Git 2.0.

           ·   <b>matching </b>- push all branches having the same name on both
               ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to remember
               the set of branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you
               always push <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> there and no other branches, the
               repository you push to will have these two branches, and your
               local <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> will be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <i>all</i> the
               branches you would push out are ready to be pushed out before
               running <i>git push</i>, as the whole point of this mode is to allow
               you to push all of the branches in one go. If you usually
               finish work on only one branch and push out the result, while
               other branches are unfinished, this mode is not for you. Also
               this mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared central
               repository, as other people may add new branches there, or
               update the tip of existing branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (<b>simple </b>is
               the new default).

       push.followTags
           If set to true enable <b>--follow-tags </b>option by default. You may
           override this configuration at time of push by specifying
           <b>--no-follow-tags</b>.

       push.gpgSign
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string <i>if-asked</i>. A true
           value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if <b>--signed </b>is
           passed to <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>. The string <i>if-asked</i> causes pushes to be
           signed if the server supports it, as if <b>--signed=if-asked </b>is
           passed to <i>git push</i>. A false value may override a value from a
           lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line flag always
           overrides this config option.

       push.recurseSubmodules
           Make sure all submodule commits used by the revisions to be
           pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If the value is
           <i>check</i> then Git will verify that all submodule commits that
           changed in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least
           one remote of the submodule. If any commits are missing, the push
           will be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If the value is
           <i>on-demand</i> then all submodules that changed in the revisions to be
           pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not able to push all
           necessary revisions it will also be aborted and exit with
           non-zero status. If the value is <i>no</i> then default behavior of
           ignoring submodules when pushing is retained. You may override
           this configuration at time of push by specifying
           <i>--recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|no</i>.

       rebase.stat
           Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the
           last rebase. False by default.

       rebase.autoSquash
           If set to true enable <b>--autosquash </b>option by default.

       rebase.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry
           before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation
           ends. This means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree.
           However, use with care: the final stash application after a
           successful rebase might result in non-trivial conflicts. Defaults
           to false.

       rebase.missingCommitsCheck
           If set to "warn", git rebase -i will print a warning if some
           commits are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the rebase
           will still proceed. If set to "error", it will print the previous
           warning and stop the rebase, <i>git rebase --edit-todo</i> can then be
           used to correct the error. If set to "ignore", no checking is
           done. To drop a commit without warning or error, use the <b>drop</b>
           command in the todo-list. Defaults to "ignore".

       rebase.instructionFormat
           A format string, as specified in <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, to be used for the
           instruction list during an interactive rebase. The format will
           automatically have the long commit hash prepended to the format.

       receive.advertiseAtomic
           By default, git-receive-pack will advertise the atomic push
           capability to its clients. If you don’t want to advertise this
           capability, set this variable to false.

       receive.advertisePushOptions
           When set to true, git-receive-pack will advertise the push
           options capability to its clients. False by default.

       receive.autogc
           By default, git-receive-pack will run "git-gc --auto" after
           receiving data from git-push and updating refs. You can stop it
           by setting this variable to false.

       receive.certNonceSeed
           By setting this variable to a string, <b>git receive-pack </b>will
           accept a <b>git push --signed </b>and verifies it by using a "nonce"
           protected by HMAC using this string as a secret key.

       receive.certNonceSlop
           When a <b>git push --signed </b>sent a push certificate with a "nonce"
           that was issued by a receive-pack serving the same repository
           within this many seconds, export the "nonce" found in the
           certificate to <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE </b>to the hooks (instead of what
           the receive-pack asked the sending side to include). This may
           allow writing checks in <b>pre-receive </b>and <b>post-receive </b>a bit
           easier. Instead of checking <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP </b>environment
           variable that records by how many seconds the nonce is stale to
           decide if they want to accept the certificate, they only can
           check <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS </b>is <b>OK</b>.

       receive.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-receive-pack will check all received
           objects. It will abort in the case of a malformed object or a
           broken link. The result of an abort are only dangling objects.
           Defaults to false. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b>
           is used instead.

       receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
           When <b>receive.fsckObjects </b>is set to true, errors can be switched
           to warnings and vice versa by configuring the
           <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>setting where the <b>&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>is the fsck
           message ID and the value is one of <b>error</b>, <b>warn </b>or <b>ignore</b>. For
           convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning with the message ID,
           e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer line - missing
           email" means that setting <b>receive.fsck.missingEmail = ignore </b>will
           hide that issue.

           This feature is intended to support working with legacy
           repositories which would not pass pushing when
           <b>receive.fsckObjects = true</b>, allowing the host to accept
           repositories with certain known issues but still catch other
           issues.

       receive.fsck.skipList
           The path to a sorted list of object names (i.e. one SHA-1 per
           line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should
           be ignored. This feature is useful when an established project
           should be accepted despite early commits containing errors that
           can be safely ignored such as invalid committer email addresses.
           Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting.

       receive.keepAlive
           After receiving the pack from the client, <b>receive-pack </b>may
           produce no output (if <b>--quiet </b>was specified) while processing the
           pack, causing some networks to drop the TCP connection. With this
           option set, if <b>receive-pack </b>does not transmit any data in this
           phase for <b>receive.keepAlive </b>seconds, it will send a short
           keepalive packet. The default is 5 seconds; set to 0 to disable
           keepalives entirely.

       receive.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects received in a push is below this limit
           then the objects will be unpacked into loose object files.
           However if the number of received objects equals or exceeds this
           limit then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after
           adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can
           make the push operation complete faster, especially on slow
           filesystems. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit </b>is
           used instead.

       receive.maxInputSize
           If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than this
           limit, then git-receive-pack will error out, instead of accepting
           the pack file. If not set or set to 0, then the size is
           unlimited.

       receive.denyDeletes
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
           deletes the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via a
           push.

       receive.denyDeleteCurrent
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
           deletes the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
           repository.

       receive.denyCurrentBranch
           If set to true or "refuse", git-receive-pack will deny a ref
           update to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
           repository. Such a push is potentially dangerous because it
           brings the HEAD out of sync with the index and working tree. If
           set to "warn", print a warning of such a push to stderr, but
           allow the push to proceed. If set to false or "ignore", allow
           such pushes with no message. Defaults to "refuse".

           Another option is "updateInstead" which will update the working
           tree if pushing into the current branch. This option is intended
           for synchronizing working directories when one side is not easily
           accessible via interactive ssh (e.g. a live web site, hence the
           requirement that the working directory be clean). This mode also
           comes in handy when developing inside a VM to test and fix code
           on different Operating Systems.

           By default, "updateInstead" will refuse the push if the working
           tree or the index have any difference from the HEAD, but the
           <b>push-to-checkout </b>hook can be used to customize this. See
           <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>.

       receive.denyNonFastForwards
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update which is
           not a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a
           push, even if that push is forced. This configuration variable is
           set when initializing a shared repository.

       receive.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>, but applies only
           to <b>receive-pack </b>(and so affects pushes, but not fetches). An
           attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by <b>git push </b>is rejected.

       receive.updateServerInfo
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will run git-update-server-info
           after receiving data from git-push and updating refs.

       receive.shallowUpdate
           If set to true, .git/shallow can be updated when new refs require
           new shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.

       remote.pushDefault
           The remote to push to by default. Overrides <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b>
           for all branches, and is overridden by <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</b>
           for specific branches.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.url
           The URL of a remote repository. See <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl
           The push URL of a remote repository. See <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the URL to
           the proxy to use for that remote. Set to the empty string to
           disable proxying for that remote.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the method
           to use for authenticating against the proxy in use (probably set
           in <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</b>). See <b>http.proxyAuthMethod</b>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.fetch
           The default set of "refspec" for <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>. See <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.push
           The default set of "refspec" for <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>. See <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.mirror
           If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave as if
           the <b>--mirror </b>option was given on the command line.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate
           If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
           using <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or the <b>update </b>subcommand of <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipFetchAll
           If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
           using <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or the <b>update </b>subcommand of <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when pushing.
           See option --receive-pack of <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when fetching.
           See option --upload-pack of <a href="git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt
           Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag following
           when fetching from remote &lt;name&gt;. Setting it to --tags will fetch
           every tag from remote &lt;name&gt;, even if they are not reachable from
           remote branch heads. Passing these flags directly to <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>
           can override this setting. See options --tags and --no-tags of
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs
           Setting this to a value &lt;vcs&gt; will cause Git to interact with the
           remote with the git-remote-&lt;vcs&gt; helper.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune
           When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
           remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the
           remote (as if the <b>--prune </b>option was given on the command line).
           Overrides <b>fetch.prune </b>settings, if any.

       remotes.&lt;group&gt;
           The list of remotes which are fetched by "git remote update
           &lt;group&gt;". See <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       repack.useDeltaBaseOffset
           By default, <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> creates packs that use delta-base
           offset. If you need to share your repository with Git older than
           version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb protocol such as
           http, then you need to set this option to "false" and repack.
           Access from old Git versions over the native protocol are
           unaffected by this option.

       repack.packKeptObjects
           If set to true, makes <b>git repack </b>act as if <b>--pack-kept-objects</b>
           was passed. See <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> for details. Defaults to <b>false</b>
           normally, but <b>true </b>if a bitmap index is being written (either via
           <b>--write-bitmap-index </b>or <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>).

       repack.writeBitmaps
           When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all objects
           to disk (e.g., when <b>git repack -a </b>is run). This index can speed
           up the "counting objects" phase of subsequent packs created for
           clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk space and extra time
           spent on the initial repack. This has no effect if multiple
           packfiles are created. Defaults to false.

       rerere.autoUpdate
           When set to true, <b>git-rerere </b>updates the index with the resulting
           contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using previously
           recorded resolution. Defaults to false.

       rerere.enabled
           Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical
           conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
           encountered again. By default, <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a> is enabled if there
           is an <b>rr-cache </b>directory under the <b>$GIT_DIR</b>, e.g. if "rerere" was
           previously used in the repository.

       sendemail.identity
           A configuration identity. When given, causes values in the
           <i>sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;</i> subsection to take precedence over values in
           the <i>sendemail</i> section. The default identity is the value of
           <b>sendemail.identity</b>.

       sendemail.smtpEncryption
           See <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a> for description. Note that this setting is
           not subject to the <i>identity</i> mechanism.

       sendemail.smtpssl (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for <i>sendemail.smtpEncryption = ssl</i>.

       sendemail.smtpsslcertpath
           Path to ca-certificates (either a directory or a single file).
           Set it to an empty string to disable certificate verification.

       sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;.*
           Identity-specific versions of the <i>sendemail.*</i>  parameters found
           below, taking precedence over those when the this identity is
           selected, through command-line or <b>sendemail.identity</b>.

       sendemail.aliasesFile, sendemail.aliasFileType, sendemail.annotate,
       sendemail.bcc, sendemail.cc, sendemail.ccCmd, sendemail.chainReplyTo,
       sendemail.confirm, sendemail.envelopeSender, sendemail.from,

       sendemail.smtpServerOption, sendemail.smtpUser, sendemail.thread,
       sendemail.transferEncoding, sendemail.validate, sendemail.xmailer
           See <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a> for description.

       sendemail.signedoffcc (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for <b>sendemail.signedoffbycc</b>.

       showbranch.default
           The default set of branches for <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>. See
           <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>.

       splitIndex.maxPercentChange
           When the split index feature is used, this specifies the percent
           of entries the split index can contain compared to the total
           number of entries in both the split index and the shared index
           before a new shared index is written. The value should be between
           0 and 100. If the value is 0 then a new shared index is always
           written, if it is 100 a new shared index is never written. By
           default the value is 20, so a new shared index is written if the
           number of entries in the split index would be greater than 20
           percent of the total number of entries. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

       splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire
           When the split index feature is used, shared index files that
           were not modified since the time this variable specifies will be
           removed when a new shared index file is created. The value "now"
           expires all entries immediately, and "never" suppresses
           expiration altogether. The default value is "2.weeks.ago". Note
           that a shared index file is considered modified (for the purpose
           of expiration) each time a new split-index file is either created
           based on it or read from it. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

       status.relativePaths
           By default, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> shows paths relative to the current
           directory. Setting this variable to <b>false </b>shows paths relative to
           the repository root (this was the default for Git prior to
           v1.5.4).

       status.short
           Set to true to enable --short by default in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>. The
           option --no-short takes precedence over this variable.

       status.branch
           Set to true to enable --branch by default in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>. The
           option --no-branch takes precedence over this variable.

       status.displayCommentPrefix
           If set to true, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> will insert a comment prefix before
           each output line (starting with <b>core.commentChar</b>, i.e.  <b># </b>by
           default). This was the behavior of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> in Git 1.8.4 and
           previous. Defaults to false.

       status.showStash
           If set to true, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> will display the number of entries
           currently stashed away. Defaults to false.

       status.showUntrackedFiles
           By default, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> show files which are
           not currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain only
           untracked files, are shown with the directory name only. Showing
           untracked files means that Git needs to lstat() all the files in
           the whole repository, which might be slow on some systems. So,
           this variable controls how the commands displays the untracked
           files. Possible values are:

           ·   <b>no </b>- Show no untracked files.

           ·   <b>normal </b>- Show untracked files and directories.

           ·   <b>all </b>- Show also individual files in untracked directories.

           If this variable is not specified, it defaults to <i>normal</i>. This
           variable can be overridden with the -u|--untracked-files option
           of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>.

       status.submoduleSummary
           Defaults to false. If this is set to a non zero number or true
           (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary
           will be enabled and a summary of commits for modified submodules
           will be shown (see --summary-limit option of <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a>).
           Please note that the summary output command will be suppressed
           for all submodules when <b>diff.ignoreSubmodules </b>is set to <i>all</i> or
           only for those submodules where <b>submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore=all</b>. The
           only exception to that rule is that status and commit will show
           staged submodule changes. To also view the summary for ignored
           submodules you can either use the --ignore-submodules=dirty
           command-line option or the <i>git submodule summary</i> command, which
           shows a similar output but does not honor these settings.

       stash.showPatch
           If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show </b>command without an
           option will show the stash entry in patch form. Defaults to
           false. See description of <i>show</i> command in <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       stash.showStat
           If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show </b>command without an
           option will show diffstat of the stash entry. Defaults to true.
           See description of <i>show</i> command in <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url
           The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the
           .gitmodules file to the git config via <i>git submodule init</i>. The
           user can change the configured URL before obtaining the submodule
           via <i>git submodule update</i>. If neither submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active or
           submodule.active are set, the presence of this variable is used
           as a fallback to indicate whether the submodule is of interest to
           git commands. See <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a> and <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> for details.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update
           The default update procedure for a submodule. This variable is
           populated by <b>git submodule init </b>from the <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> file. See
           description of <i>update</i> command in <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a>.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch
           The remote branch name for a submodule, used by <b>git submodule</b>
           <b>update --remote</b>. Set this option to override the value found in
           the <b>.gitmodules </b>file. See <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a> and <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> for
           details.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules
           This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this
           submodule. It can be overridden by using the
           --[no-]recurse-submodules command-line option to "git fetch" and
           "git pull". This setting will override that from in the
           <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> file.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore
           Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff family
           show a submodule as modified. When set to "all", it will never be
           considered modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the
           output of status and commit when it has been staged), "dirty"
           will ignore all changes to the submodules work tree and takes
           only differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit
           recorded in the superproject into account. "untracked" will
           additionally let submodules with modified tracked files in their
           work tree show up. Using "none" (the default when this option is
           not set) also shows submodules that have untracked files in their
           work tree as changed. This setting overrides any setting made in
           .gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be overridden
           on the command line by using the "--ignore-submodules" option.
           The <i>git submodule</i> commands are not affected by this setting.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active
           Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest to git
           commands. This config option takes precedence over the
           submodule.active config option.

       submodule.active
           A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match against
           a submodule’s path to determine if the submodule is of interest
           to git commands.

       submodule.recurse
           Specifies if commands recurse into submodules by default. This
           applies to all commands that have a <b>--recurse-submodules </b>option.
           Defaults to false.

       submodule.fetchJobs
           Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the same
           time. A positive integer allows up to that number of submodules
           fetched in parallel. A value of 0 will give some reasonable
           default. If unset, it defaults to 1.

       submodule.alternateLocation
           Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when submodules
           are cloned. Possible values are <b>no</b>, <b>superproject</b>. By default <b>no</b>
           is assumed, which doesn’t add references. When the value is set
           to <b>superproject </b>the submodule to be cloned computes its
           alternates location relative to the superprojects alternate.

       submodule.alternateErrorStrategy
           Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a submodule
           as computed via <b>submodule.alternateLocation</b>. Possible values are
           <b>ignore</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>die</b>. Default is <b>die</b>.

       tag.forceSignAnnotated
           A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be GPG
           signed. If <b>--annotate </b>is specified on the command line, it takes
           precedence over this option.

       tag.sort
           This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when displayed
           by <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>. Without the "--sort=&lt;value&gt;" option provided, the
           value of this variable will be used as the default.

       tar.umask
           This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of tar
           archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the world
           write bit. The special value "user" indicates that the archiving
           user’s umask will be used instead. See umask(2) and
           <a href="git-archive.1.html">git-archive(1)</a>.

       transfer.fsckObjects
           When <b>fetch.fsckObjects </b>or <b>receive.fsckObjects </b>are not set, the
           value of this variable is used instead. Defaults to false.

       transfer.hideRefs
           String(s) <b>receive-pack </b>and <b>upload-pack </b>use to decide which refs
           to omit from their initial advertisements. Use more than one
           definition to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that is
           under the hierarchies listed in the value of this variable is
           excluded, and is hidden when responding to <b>git push </b>or <b>git fetch</b>.
           See <b>receive.hideRefs </b>and <b>uploadpack.hideRefs </b>for program-specific
           versions of this config.

           You may also include a <b>!  </b>in front of the ref name to negate the
           entry, explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry marked it
           as hidden. If you have multiple hideRefs values, later entries
           override earlier ones (and entries in more-specific config files
           override less-specific ones).

           If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped from
           each reference before it is matched against <b>transfer.hiderefs</b>
           patterns. For example, if <b>refs/heads/master </b>is specified in
           <b>transfer.hideRefs </b>and the current namespace is <b>foo</b>, then
           <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master </b>is omitted from the
           advertisements but <b>refs/heads/master </b>and
           <b>refs/namespaces/bar/refs/heads/master </b>are still advertised as
           so-called "have" lines. In order to match refs before stripping,
           add a <b>^ </b>in front of the ref name. If you combine <b>!  </b>and <b>^</b>, <b>!</b>
           must be specified first.

           Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the
           target objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
           section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s best to keep
           private data in a separate repository.

       transfer.unpackLimit
           When <b>fetch.unpackLimit </b>or <b>receive.unpackLimit </b>are not set, the
           value of this variable is used instead. The default value is 100.

       uploadarchive.allowUnreachable
           If true, allow clients to use <b>git archive --remote </b>to request any
           tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the
           discussion in the "SECURITY" section of <a href="git-upload-archive.1.html">git-upload-archive(1)</a> for
           more details. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       uploadpack.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>, but applies only
           to <b>upload-pack </b>(and so affects only fetches, not pushes). An
           attempt to fetch a hidden ref by <b>git fetch </b>will fail. See also
           <b>uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</b>.

       uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant
           When <b>uploadpack.hideRefs </b>is in effect, allow <b>upload-pack </b>to
           accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the tip of a
           hidden ref (by default, such a request is rejected). See also
           <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b>. Even if this is false, a client may be able
           to steal objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
           section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s best to keep
           private data in a separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant
           Allow <b>upload-pack </b>to accept a fetch request that asks for an
           object that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that
           calculating object reachability is computationally expensive.
           Defaults to <b>false</b>. Even if this is false, a client may be able to
           steal objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
           section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s best to keep
           private data in a separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant
           Allow <b>upload-pack </b>to accept a fetch request that asks for any
           object at all. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       uploadpack.keepAlive
           When <b>upload-pack </b>has started <b>pack-objects</b>, there may be a quiet
           period while <b>pack-objects </b>prepares the pack. Normally it would
           output progress information, but if <b>--quiet </b>was used for the
           fetch, <b>pack-objects </b>will output nothing at all until the pack
           data begins. Some clients and networks may consider the server to
           be hung and give up. Setting this option instructs <b>upload-pack </b>to
           send an empty keepalive packet every <b>uploadpack.keepAlive</b>
           seconds. Setting this option to 0 disables keepalive packets
           entirely. The default is 5 seconds.

       uploadpack.packObjectsHook
           If this option is set, when <b>upload-pack </b>would run <b>git</b>
           <b>pack-objects </b>to create a packfile for a client, it will run this
           shell command instead. The <b>pack-objects </b>command and arguments it
           <i>would</i> have run (including the <b>git pack-objects </b>at the beginning)
           are appended to the shell command. The stdin and stdout of the
           hook are treated as if <b>pack-objects </b>itself was run. I.e.,
           <b>upload-pack </b>will feed input intended for <b>pack-objects </b>to the
           hook, and expects a completed packfile on stdout.

           Note that this configuration variable is ignored if it is seen in
           the repository-level config (this is a safety measure against
           fetching from untrusted repositories).

       url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to start,
           instead, with &lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site serves a large
           number of repositories, and serves them with multiple access
           methods, and some users need to use different access methods,
           this feature allows people to specify any of the equivalent URLs
           and have Git automatically rewrite the URL to the best
           alternative for the particular user, even for a never-before-seen
           repository on the site. When more than one insteadOf strings
           match a given URL, the longest match is used.

           Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the
           rewritten URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom
           protocol or remote helper, you may need to adjust the
           <b>protocol.*.allow </b>config to permit the request. In particular,
           protocols you expect to use for submodules must be set to <b>always</b>
           rather than the default of <b>user</b>. See the description of
           <b>protocol.allow </b>above.

       url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to;
           instead, it will be rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;, and the
           resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves
           a large number of repositories, and serves them with multiple
           access methods, some of which do not allow push, this feature
           allows people to specify a pull-only URL and have Git
           automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a
           never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one
           pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is
           used. If a remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this
           setting for that remote.

       user.email
           Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits.
           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</b>, <b>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</b>,
           and <b>EMAIL </b>environment variables. See <a href="git-commit-tree.1.html">git-commit-tree(1)</a>.

       user.name
           Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits. Can
           be overridden by the <b>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME </b>and <b>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</b>
           environment variables. See <a href="git-commit-tree.1.html">git-commit-tree(1)</a>.

       user.useConfigOnly
           Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for <b>user.email </b>and
           <b>user.name</b>, and instead retrieve the values only from the
           configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses
           and would like to use a different one for each repository, then
           with this configuration option set to <b>true </b>in the global config
           along with a name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before
           making new commits in a newly cloned repository. Defaults to
           <b>false</b>.

       user.signingKey
           If <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a> or <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> is not selecting the key you want
           it to automatically when creating a signed tag or commit, you can
           override the default selection with this variable. This option is
           passed unchanged to gpg’s --local-user parameter, so you may
           specify a key using any method that gpg supports.

       versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for <b>versionsort.suffix</b>. Ignored if
           <b>versionsort.suffix </b>is set.

       versionsort.suffix
           Even when version sort is used in <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>, tagnames with the
           same base version but different suffixes are still sorted
           lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing
           after the main release (e.g. "1.0-rc1" after "1.0"). This
           variable can be specified to determine the sorting order of tags
           with different suffixes.

           By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname
           containing that suffix will appear before the corresponding main
           release. E.g. if the variable is set to "-rc", then all "1.0-rcX"
           tags will appear before "1.0". If specified multiple times, once
           per suffix, then the order of suffixes in the configuration will
           determine the sorting order of tagnames with those suffixes. E.g.
           if "-pre" appears before "-rc" in the configuration, then all
           "1.0-preX" tags will be listed before any "1.0-rcX" tags. The
           placement of the main release tag relative to tags with various
           suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix among
           those other suffixes. E.g. if the suffixes "-rc", "", "-ck" and
           "-bfs" appear in the configuration in this order, then all
           "v4.8-rcX" tags are listed first, followed by "v4.8", then
           "v4.8-ckX" and finally "v4.8-bfsX".

           If more than one suffixes match the same tagname, then that
           tagname will be sorted according to the suffix which starts at
           the earliest position in the tagname. If more than one different
           matching suffixes start at that earliest position, then that
           tagname will be sorted according to the longest of those
           suffixes. The sorting order between different suffixes is
           undefined if they are in multiple config files.

       web.browser
           Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands.
           Currently only <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> and <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a> may use it.
