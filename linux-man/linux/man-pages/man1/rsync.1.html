<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It
       can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or
       to/from a remote rsync daemon.  It offers a large number of options
       that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
       specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous for its
       delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over
       the network by sending only the differences between the source files
       and the existing files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for
       backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday
       use.

       Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check"
       algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size
       or in last-modified time.  Any changes in the other preserved
       attributes (as requested by options) are made on the destination file
       directly when the quick check indicates that the file’s data does not
       need to be updated.

       Some of the additional features of rsync are:

       o      support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and
              permissions

       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar

       o      a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would
              ignore

       o      can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh

       o      does not require super-user privileges

       o      pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs

       o      support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal
              for mirroring)
</pre>
<h2><a id="GENERAL" href="#GENERAL"></a>GENERAL  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the
       current host (it does not support copying files between two remote
       hosts).

       There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system:
       using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or
       contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell
       transport is used whenever the source or destination path contains a
       single colon (:) separator after a host specification.  Contacting an
       rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination path
       contains a double colon (::) separator after a host specification, OR
       when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the "USING RSYNC-DAEMON
       FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION" section for an exception to
       this latter rule).

       As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a
       destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to "ls
       -l".

       As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a
       remote host, the copy occurs locally (see also the <b>--list-only</b>
       option).

       Rsync refers to the local side as the "client" and the remote side as
       the "server".  Don’t confuse "server" with an rsync daemon -- a
       daemon is always a server, but a server can be either a daemon or a
       remote-shell spawned process.
</pre>
<h2><a id="SETUP" href="#SETUP"></a>SETUP  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       See the file README for installation instructions.

       Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access
       via a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the
       rsync daemon-mode protocol).  For remote transfers, a modern rsync
       uses ssh for its communications, but it may have been configured to
       use a different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.

       You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the
       <b>-e </b>command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment
       variable.

       Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination
       machines.
</pre>
<h2><a id="USAGE" href="#USAGE"></a>USAGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source
       and a destination, one of which may be remote.

       Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:

              rsync -t *.c foo:src/

       This would transfer all files matching the pattern *.c from the
       current directory to the directory src on the machine foo. If any of
       the files already exist on the remote system then the rsync
       remote-update protocol is used to update the file by sending only the
       differences in the data.  Note that the expansion of wildcards on the
       commandline (*.c) into a list of files is handled by the shell before
       it runs rsync and not by rsync itself (exactly the same as all other
       posix-style programs).

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp

       This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar
       on the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local
       machine. The files are transferred in "archive" mode, which ensures
       that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships,
       etc. are preserved in the transfer.  Additionally, compression will
       be used to reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp

       A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid
       creating an additional directory level at the destination.  You can
       think of a trailing / on a source as meaning "copy the contents of
       this directory" as opposed to "copy the directory by name", but in
       both cases the attributes of the containing directory are transferred
       to the containing directory on the destination.  In other words, each
       of the following commands copies the files in the same way, including
       their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo:

              rsync -av /src/foo /dest
              rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo

       Note also that host and module references don’t require a trailing
       slash to copy the contents of the default directory.  For example,
       both of these copy the remote directory’s contents into "/dest":

              rsync -av host: /dest
              rsync -av host::module /dest

       You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and
       destination don’t have a ’:’ in the name. In this case it behaves
       like an improved copy command.

       Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a
       particular rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:

              rsync somehost.mydomain.com::

       See the following section for more details.
</pre>
<h2><a id="ADVANCED_USAGE" href="#ADVANCED_USAGE"></a>ADVANCED USAGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host is done
       by specifying additional remote-host args in the same style as the
       first, or with the hostname omitted.  For instance, all these work:

              rsync -av host:file1 :file2 host:file{3,4} /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file{1,2} host::modname/file3 /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file1 ::modname/file{3,4}

       Older versions of rsync required using quoted spaces in the SRC, like
       these examples:

              rsync -av host:'dir1/file1 dir2/file2' /dest
              rsync host::'modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2' /dest

       This word-splitting still works (by default) in the latest rsync, but
       is not as easy to use as the first method.

       If you need to transfer a filename that contains whitespace, you can
       either specify the <b>--protect-args </b>(<b>-s</b>) option, or you’ll need to
       escape the whitespace in a way that the remote shell will understand.
       For instance:

              rsync -av host:'file\ name\ with\ spaces' /dest
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON" href="#CONNECTING_TO_AN_RSYNC_DAEMON"></a>CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the
       transport.  In this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync
       daemon, typically using TCP port 873.  (This obviously requires the
       daemon to be running on the remote system, so refer to the STARTING
       AN RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS section below for information
       on that.)

       Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell
       except that:

       o      you either use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to
              separate the hostname from the path, or you use an rsync://
              URL.

       o      the first word of the "path" is actually a module name.

       o      the remote daemon may print a message of the day when you
              connect.

       o      if you specify no path name on the remote daemon then the list
              of accessible paths on the daemon will be shown.

       o      if you specify no local destination then a listing of the
              specified files on the remote daemon is provided.

       o      you must not specify the <b>--rsh </b>(<b>-e</b>) option.

       An example that copies all the files in a remote module named "src":

           rsync -av host::src /dest

       Some modules on the remote daemon may require authentication. If so,
       you will receive a password prompt when you connect. You can avoid
       the password prompt by setting the environment variable
       RSYNC_PASSWORD to the password you want to use or using the
       <b>--password-file </b>option. This may be useful when scripting rsync.

       WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all
       users. On those systems using <b>--password-file </b>is recommended.

       You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the
       environment variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to
       your web proxy.  Note that your web proxy’s configuration must
       support proxy connections to port 873.

       You may also establish a daemon connection using a program as a proxy
       by setting the environment variable RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG to the
       commands you wish to run in place of making a direct socket
       connection.  The string may contain the escape "%H" to represent the
       hostname specified in the rsync command (so use "%%" if you need a
       single "%" in your string).  For example:

         export RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG='ssh proxyhost nc %H 873'
         rsync -av targethost1::module/src/ /dest/
         rsync -av rsync:://targethost2/module/src/ /dest/

       The command specified above uses ssh to run nc (netcat) on a
       proxyhost, which forwards all data to port 873 (the rsync daemon) on
       the targethost (%H).

<h2><a id="USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION" href="#USING_RSYNC-DAEMON_FEATURES_VIA_A_REMOTE-SHELL_CONNECTION"></a>USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon
       (such as named modules) without actually allowing any new socket
       connections into a system (other than what is already required to
       allow remote-shell access).  Rsync supports connecting to a host
       using a remote shell and then spawning a single-use "daemon" server
       that expects to read its config file in the home dir of the remote
       user.  This can be useful if you want to encrypt a daemon-style
       transfer’s data, but since the daemon is started up fresh by the
       remote user, you may not be able to use features such as chroot or
       change the uid used by the daemon.  (For another way to encrypt a
       daemon transfer, consider using ssh to tunnel a local port to a
       remote machine and configure a normal rsync daemon on that remote
       host to only allow connections from "localhost".)

       From the user’s perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell
       connection uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal
       rsync-daemon transfer, with the only exception being that you must
       explicitly set the remote shell program on the command-line with the
       <b>--rsh=COMMAND </b>option.  (Setting the RSYNC_RSH in the environment will
       not turn on this functionality.)  For example:

           rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest

       If you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind
       that the user@ prefix in front of the host is specifying the
       rsync-user value (for a module that requires user-based
       authentication).  This means that you must give the ’-l user’ option
       to ssh when specifying the remote-shell, as in this example that uses
       the short version of the <b>--rsh </b>option:

           rsync -av -e "ssh -l ssh-user" rsync-user@host::module /dest

       The "ssh-user" will be used at the ssh level; the "rsync-user" will
       be used to log-in to the "module".

       In order to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to
       have a daemon already running (or it needs to have configured
       something like inetd to spawn an rsync daemon for incoming
       connections on a particular port).  For full information on how to
       start a daemon that will handling incoming socket connections, see
       the <a href="../man5/rsyncd.conf.5.html">rsyncd.conf(5)</a> man page -- that is the config file for the
       daemon, and it contains the full details for how to run the daemon
       (including stand-alone and inetd configurations).

       If you’re using one of the remote-shell transports for the transfer,
       there is no need to manually start an rsync daemon.

       Rsync always sorts the specified filenames into its internal transfer
       list.  This handles the merging together of the contents of
       identically named directories, makes it easy to remove duplicate
       filenames, and may confuse someone when the files are transferred in
       a different order than what was given on the command-line.

       If you need a particular file to be transferred prior to another,
       either separate the files into different rsync calls, or consider
       using <b>--delay-updates </b>(which doesn’t affect the sorted transfer
       order, but does make the final file-updating phase happen much more
       rapidly).
</pre>
<h2><a id="EXAMPLES" href="#EXAMPLES"></a>EXAMPLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Here are some examples of how I use rsync.

       To backup my wife’s home directory, which consists of large MS Word
       files and mail folders, I use a cron job that runs

              rsync -Cavz . arvidsjaur:backup

       each night over a PPP connection to a duplicate directory on my
       machine "arvidsjaur".

       To synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile
       targets:

           get:
                   rsync -avuzb --exclude '*~' samba:samba/ .
           put:
                   rsync -Cavuzb . samba:samba/
           sync: get put

       this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the other end of the
       connection. I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which
       saves a lot of time as the remote CVS protocol isn’t very efficient.

       I mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" ftp sites with the
       command:

       rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"

       This is launched from cron every few hours.

       Rsync accepts both long (double-dash + word) and short (single-dash +
       letter) options.  The full list of the available options are
       described below.  If an option can be specified in more than one way,
       the choices are comma-separated.  Some options only have a long
       variant, not a short.  If the option takes a parameter, the parameter
       is only listed after the long variant, even though it must also be
       specified for the short.  When specifying a parameter, you can either
       use the form --option=param or replace the ’=’ with whitespace.  The
       parameter may need to be quoted in some manner for it to survive the
       shell’s command-line parsing.  Keep in mind that a leading tilde (~)
       in a filename is substituted by your shell, so --option=~/foo will
       not change the tilde into your home directory (remove the ’=’ for
       that).

       <b>--help </b>Print a short help page describing the options available in
              rsync and exit.  For backward-compatibility with older
              versions of rsync, the help will also be output if you use the
              <b>-h </b>option without any other args.

       <b>--version</b>
              print the rsync version number and exit.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              This option increases the amount of information you are given
              during the transfer.  By default, rsync works silently. A
              single <b>-v </b>will give you information about what files are being
              transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two <b>-v </b>options
              will give you information on what files are being skipped and
              slightly more information at the end. More than two <b>-v </b>options
              should only be used if you are debugging rsync.

              In a modern rsync, the <b>-v </b>option is equivalent to the setting
              of groups of <b>--info </b>and <b>--debug </b>options.  You can choose to
              use these newer options in addition to, or in place of using
              <b>--verbose</b>, as any fine-grained settings override the implied
              settings of <b>-v</b>.  Both <b>--info </b>and <b>--debug </b>have a way to ask for
              help that tells you exactly what flags are set for each
              increase in verbosity.

              However, do keep in mind that a daemon’s "max verbosity"
              setting will limit how high of a level the various individual
              flags can be set on the daemon side.  For instance, if the max
              is 2, then any info and/or debug flag that is set to a higher
              value than what would be set by <b>-vv </b>will be downgraded to the
              <b>-vv </b>level in the daemon’s logging.

       <b>--info=FLAGS</b>
              This option lets you have fine-grained control over the
              information output you want to see.  An individual flag name
              may be followed by a level number, with 0 meaning to silence
              that output, 1 being the default output level, and higher
              numbers increasing the output of that flag (for those that
              support higher levels).  Use <b>--info=help </b>to see all the
              available flag names, what they output, and what flag names
              are added for each increase in the verbose level.  Some
              examples:

                  rsync -a --info=progress2 src/ dest/
                  rsync -avv --info=stats2,misc1,flist0 src/ dest/

              Note that <b>--info=name</b>’s output is affected by the <b>--out-format</b>
              and <b>--itemize-changes </b>(<b>-i</b>) options.  See those options for
              more information on what is output and when.

              This option was added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the
              server side might reject your attempts at fine-grained control
              (if one or more flags needed to be send to the server and the
              server was too old to understand them).  See also the "max
              verbosity" caveat above when dealing with a daemon.

       <b>--debug=FLAGS</b>
              This option lets you have fine-grained control over the debug
              output you want to see.  An individual flag name may be
              followed by a level number, with 0 meaning to silence that
              output, 1 being the default output level, and higher numbers
              increasing the output of that flag (for those that support
              higher levels).  Use <b>--debug=help </b>to see all the available
              flag names, what they output, and what flag names are added
              for each increase in the verbose level.  Some examples:

                  rsync -avvv --debug=none src/ dest/
                  rsync -avA --del --debug=del2,acl src/ dest/

              Note that some debug messages will only be output when
              <b>--msgs2stderr </b>is specified, especially those pertaining to I/O
              and buffer debugging.

              This option was added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the
              server side might reject your attempts at fine-grained control
              (if one or more flags needed to be send to the server and the
              server was too old to understand them).  See also the "max
              verbosity" caveat above when dealing with a daemon.

       <b>--msgs2stderr</b>
              This option changes rsync to send all its output directly to
              stderr rather than to send messages to the client side via the
              protocol (which normally outputs info messages via stdout).
              This is mainly intended for debugging in order to avoid
              changing the data sent via the protocol, since the extra
              protocol data can change what is being tested.  The option
              does not affect the remote side of a transfer without using
              <b>--remote-option </b>-- e.g. <b>-M--msgs2stderr</b>.  Also keep in mind
              that a daemon connection does not have a stderr channel to
              send messages back to the client side, so if you are doing any
              daemon-transfer debugging using this option, you should start
              up a daemon using <b>--no-detach </b>so that you can see the stderr
              output on the daemon side.

              This option has the side-effect of making stderr output get
              line-buffered so that the merging of the output of 3 programs
              happens in a more readable manner.

       <b>-q, --quiet</b>
              This option decreases the amount of information you are given
              during the transfer, notably suppressing information messages
              from the remote server. This option is useful when invoking
              rsync from cron.

       <b>--no-motd</b>
              This option affects the information that is output by the
              client at the start of a daemon transfer.  This suppresses the
              message-of-the-day (MOTD) text, but it also affects the list
              of modules that the daemon sends in response to the "rsync
              host::" request (due to a limitation in the rsync protocol),
              so omit this option if you want to request the list of modules
              from the daemon.

       <b>-I, --ignore-times</b>
              Normally rsync will skip any files that are already the same
              size and have the same modification timestamp.  This option
              turns off this "quick check" behavior, causing all files to be
              updated.

       <b>--size-only</b>
              This modifies rsync’s "quick check" algorithm for finding
              files that need to be transferred, changing it from the
              default of transferring files with either a changed size or a
              changed last-modified time to just looking for files that have
              changed in size.  This is useful when starting to use rsync
              after using another mirroring system which may not preserve
              timestamps exactly.

       <b>--modify-window</b>
              When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as
              being equal if they differ by no more than the modify-window
              value.  This is normally 0 (for an exact match), but you may
              find it useful to set this to a larger value in some
              situations.  In particular, when transferring to or from an MS
              Windows FAT filesystem (which represents times with a 2-second
              resolution), <b>--modify-window=1 </b>is useful (allowing times to
              differ by up to 1 second).

       <b>-c, --checksum</b>
              This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been
              changed and are in need of a transfer.  Without this option,
              rsync uses a "quick check" that (by default) checks if each
              file’s size and time of last modification match between the
              sender and receiver.  This option changes this to compare a
              128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size.
              Generating the checksums means that both sides will expend a
              lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the
              transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done
              to transfer changed files), so this can slow things down
              significantly.

              The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the
              file-system scan that builds the list of the available files.
              The receiver generates its checksums when it is scanning for
              changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same
              size as the corresponding sender’s file:  files with either a
              changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.

              Note that rsync always verifies that each <i>transferred</i> file was
              correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a
              whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is
              transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer
              verification has nothing to do with this option’s
              before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?"
              check.

              For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the
              checksum used is MD5.  For older protocols, the checksum used
              is MD4.

       <b>-a, --archive</b>
              This is equivalent to <b>-rlptgoD</b>. It is a quick way of saying
              you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything
              (with -H being a notable omission).  The only exception to the
              above equivalence is when <b>--files-from </b>is specified, in which
              case <b>-r </b>is not implied.

              Note that <b>-a does not preserve hardlinks</b>, because finding
              multiply-linked files is expensive.  You must separately
              specify <b>-H</b>.

       --no-OPTION
              You may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing the
              option name with "no-".  Not all options may be prefixed with
              a "no-": only options that are implied by other options (e.g.
              <b>--no-D</b>, <b>--no-perms</b>) or have different defaults in various
              circumstances (e.g. <b>--no-whole-file</b>, <b>--no-blocking-io</b>,
              <b>--no-dirs</b>).  You may specify either the short or the long
              option name after the "no-" prefix (e.g. <b>--no-R </b>is the same as
              <b>--no-relative</b>).

              For example: if you want to use <b>-a </b>(<b>--archive</b>) but don’t want
              <b>-o </b>(<b>--owner</b>), instead of converting <b>-a </b>into <b>-rlptgD</b>, you could
              specify <b>-a --no-o </b>(or <b>-a --no-owner</b>).

              The order of the options is important:  if you specify <b>--no-r</b>
              <b>-a</b>, the <b>-r </b>option would end up being turned on, the opposite
              of <b>-a --no-r</b>.  Note also that the side-effects of the
              <b>--files-from </b>option are NOT positional, as it affects the
              default state of several options and slightly changes the
              meaning of <b>-a </b>(see the <b>--files-from </b>option for more details).

       <b>-r, --recursive</b>
              This tells rsync to copy directories recursively.  See also
              <b>--dirs </b>(<b>-d</b>).

              Beginning with rsync 3.0.0, the recursive algorithm used is
              now an incremental scan that uses much less memory than before
              and begins the transfer after the scanning of the first few
              directories have been completed.  This incremental scan only
              affects our recursion algorithm, and does not change a
              non-recursive transfer.  It is also only possible when both
              ends of the transfer are at least version 3.0.0.

              Some options require rsync to know the full file list, so
              these options disable the incremental recursion mode.  These
              include: <b>--delete-before</b>, <b>--delete-after</b>, <b>--prune-empty-dirs</b>,
              and <b>--delay-updates</b>.  Because of this, the default delete mode
              when you specify <b>--delete </b>is now <b>--delete-during </b>when both
              ends of the connection are at least 3.0.0 (use <b>--del </b>or
              <b>--delete-during </b>to request this improved deletion mode
              explicitly).  See also the <b>--delete-delay </b>option that is a
              better choice than using <b>--delete-after</b>.

              Incremental recursion can be disabled using the
              <b>--no-inc-recursive </b>option or its shorter <b>--no-i-r </b>alias.

       <b>-R, --relative</b>
              Use relative paths. This means that the full path names
              specified on the command line are sent to the server rather
              than just the last parts of the filenames. This is
              particularly useful when you want to send several different
              directories at the same time. For example, if you used this
              command:

                 rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              ... this would create a file named baz.c in /tmp/ on the
              remote machine. If instead you used

                 rsync -avR /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz.c would be created on the
              remote machine, preserving its full path.  These extra path
              elements are called "implied directories" (i.e. the "foo" and
              the "foo/bar" directories in the above example).

              Beginning with rsync 3.0.0, rsync always sends these implied
              directories as real directories in the file list, even if a
              path element is really a symlink on the sending side.  This
              prevents some really unexpected behaviors when copying the
              full path of a file that you didn’t realize had a symlink in
              its path.  If you want to duplicate a server-side symlink,
              include both the symlink via its path, and referent directory
              via its real path.  If you’re dealing with an older rsync on
              the sending side, you may need to use the <b>--no-implied-dirs</b>
              option.

              It is also possible to limit the amount of path information
              that is sent as implied directories for each path you specify.
              With a modern rsync on the sending side (beginning with
              2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into the source path,
              like this:

                 rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine.  (Note
              that the dot must be followed by a slash, so "/foo/." would
              not be abbreviated.)  For older rsync versions, you would need
              to use a chdir to limit the source path.  For example, when
              pushing files:

                 (cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/)

              (Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell,
              so that the "cd" command doesn’t remain in effect for future
              commands.)  If you’re pulling files from an older rsync, use
              this idiom (but only for a non-daemon transfer):

                 rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /foo; rsync" \
                     remote:bar/baz.c /tmp/

       <b>--no-implied-dirs</b>
              This option affects the default behavior of the <b>--relative</b>
              option.  When it is specified, the attributes of the implied
              directories from the source names are not included in the
              transfer.  This means that the corresponding path elements on
              the destination system are left unchanged if they exist, and
              any missing implied directories are created with default
              attributes.  This even allows these implied path elements to
              have big differences, such as being a symlink to a directory
              on the receiving side.

              For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told
              rsync to transfer the file "path/foo/file", the directories
              "path" and "path/foo" are implied when <b>--relative </b>is used.  If
              "path/foo" is a symlink to "bar" on the destination system,
              the receiving rsync would ordinarily delete "path/foo",
              recreate it as a directory, and receive the file into the new
              directory.  With <b>--no-implied-dirs</b>, the receiving rsync
              updates "path/foo/file" using the existing path elements,
              which means that the file ends up being created in "path/bar".
              Another way to accomplish this link preservation is to use the
              <b>--keep-dirlinks </b>option (which will also affect symlinks to
              directories in the rest of the transfer).

              When pulling files from an rsync older than 3.0.0, you may
              need to use this option if the sending side has a symlink in
              the path you request and you wish the implied directories to
              be transferred as normal directories.

       <b>-b, --backup</b>
              With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as
              each file is transferred or deleted.  You can control where
              the backup file goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended
              using the <b>--backup-dir </b>and <b>--suffix </b>options.

              Note that if you don’t specify <b>--backup-dir</b>, (1) the
              <b>--omit-dir-times </b>option will be implied, and (2) if <b>--delete</b>
              is also in effect (without <b>--delete-excluded</b>), rsync will add
              a "protect" filter-rule for the backup suffix to the end of
              all your existing excludes (e.g. <b>-f "P *~"</b>).  This will
              prevent previously backed-up files from being deleted.  Note
              that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may need
              to manually insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere
              higher up in the list so that it has a high enough priority to
              be effective (e.g., if your rules specify a trailing
              inclusion/exclusion of ’*’, the auto-added rule would never be
              reached).

       <b>--backup-dir=DIR</b>
              In combination with the <b>--backup </b>option, this tells rsync to
              store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving
              side.  This can be used for incremental backups.  You can
              additionally specify a backup suffix using the <b>--suffix </b>option
              (otherwise the files backed up in the specified directory will
              keep their original filenames).

              Note that if you specify a relative path, the backup directory
              will be relative to the destination directory, so you probably
              want to specify either an absolute path or a path that starts
              with "../".  If an rsync daemon is the receiver, the backup
              dir cannot go outside the module’s path hierarchy, so take
              extra care not to delete it or copy into it.

       <b>--suffix=SUFFIX</b>
              This option allows you to override the default backup suffix
              used with the <b>--backup </b>(<b>-b</b>) option. The default suffix is a ~
              if no -<b>-backup-dir </b>was specified, otherwise it is an empty
              string.

       <b>-u, --update</b>
              This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the
              destination and have a modified time that is newer than the
              source file.  (If an existing destination file has a
              modification time equal to the source file’s, it will be
              updated if the sizes are different.)

              Note that this does not affect the copying of dirs, symlinks,
              or other special files.  Also, a difference of file format
              between the sender and receiver is always considered to be
              important enough for an update, no matter what date is on the
              objects.  In other words, if the source has a directory where
              the destination has a file, the transfer would occur
              regardless of the timestamps.

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t
              affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it
              doesn’t affect deletions.  It just limits the files that the
              receiver requests to be transferred.

       <b>--inplace</b>
              This option changes how rsync transfers a file when its data
              needs to be updated: instead of the default method of creating
              a new copy of the file and moving it into place when it is
              complete, rsync instead writes the updated data directly to
              the destination file.

              This has several effects:

              o      Hard links are not broken.  This means the new data
                     will be visible through other hard links to the
                     destination file.  Moreover, attempts to copy differing
                     source files onto a multiply-linked destination file
                     will result in a "tug of war" with the destination data
                     changing back and forth.

              o      In-use binaries cannot be updated (either the OS will
                     prevent this from happening, or binaries that attempt
                     to swap-in their data will misbehave or crash).

              o      The file’s data will be in an inconsistent state during
                     the transfer and will be left that way if the transfer
                     is interrupted or if an update fails.

              o      A file that rsync cannot write to cannot be updated.
                     While a super user can update any file, a normal user
                     needs to be granted write permission for the open of
                     the file for writing to be successful.

              o      The efficiency of rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm may
                     be reduced if some data in the destination file is
                     overwritten before it can be copied to a position later
                     in the file.  This does not apply if you use <b>--backup</b>,
                     since rsync is smart enough to use the backup file as
                     the basis file for the transfer.

              WARNING: you should not use this option to update files that
              are being accessed by others, so be careful when choosing to
              use this for a copy.

              This option is useful for transferring large files with
              block-based changes or appended data, and also on systems that
              are disk bound, not network bound.  It can also help keep a
              copy-on-write filesystem snapshot from diverging the entire
              contents of a file that only has minor changes.

              The option implies <b>--partial </b>(since an interrupted transfer
              does not delete the file), but conflicts with <b>--partial-dir</b>
              and <b>--delay-updates</b>.  Prior to rsync 2.6.4 <b>--inplace </b>was also
              incompatible with <b>--compare-dest </b>and <b>--link-dest</b>.

       <b>--append</b>
              This causes rsync to update a file by appending data onto the
              end of the file, which presumes that the data that already
              exists on the receiving side is identical with the start of
              the file on the sending side.  If a file needs to be
              transferred and its size on the receiver is the same or longer
              than the size on the sender, the file is skipped.  This does
              not interfere with the updating of a file’s non-content
              attributes (e.g. permissions, ownership, etc.) when the file
              does not need to be transferred, nor does it affect the
              updating of any non-regular files.  Implies <b>--inplace</b>, but
              does not conflict with <b>--sparse </b>(since it is always extending
              a file’s length).

              The use of <b>--append </b>can be dangerous if you aren’t 100% sure
              that the files that are longer have only grown by the
              appending of data onto the end.  You should thus use
              include/exclude/filter rules to ensure that such a transfer is
              only affecting files that you know to be growing via appended
              data.

       <b>--append-verify</b>
              This works just like the <b>--append </b>option, but the existing
              data on the receiving side is included in the full-file
              checksum verification step, which will cause a file to be
              resent if the final verification step fails (rsync uses a
              normal, non-appending <b>--inplace </b>transfer for the resend).

              Note: prior to rsync 3.0.0, the <b>--append </b>option worked like
              <b>--append-verify</b>, so if you are interacting with an older rsync
              (or the transfer is using a protocol prior to 30), specifying
              either append option will initiate an <b>--append-verify</b>
              transfer.

       <b>-d, --dirs</b>
              Tell the sending side to include any directories that are
              encountered.  Unlike <b>--recursive</b>, a directory’s contents are
              not copied unless the directory name specified is "." or ends
              with a trailing slash (e.g. ".", "dir/.", "dir/", etc.).
              Without this option or the <b>--recursive </b>option, rsync will skip
              all directories it encounters (and output a message to that
              effect for each one).  If you specify both <b>--dirs </b>and
              <b>--recursive</b>, <b>--recursive </b>takes precedence.

              The <b>--dirs </b>option is implied by the <b>--files-from </b>option or the
              <b>--list-only </b>option (including an implied <b>--list-only </b>usage) if
              <b>--recursive </b>wasn’t specified (so that directories are seen in
              the listing).  Specify <b>--no-dirs </b>(or <b>--no-d</b>) if you want to
              turn this off.

              There is also a backward-compatibility helper option,
              <b>--old-dirs </b>(or <b>--old-d</b>) that tells rsync to use a hack of "-r
              --exclude=’/*/*’" to get an older rsync to list a single
              directory without recursing.

       <b>-l, --links</b>
              When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the
              destination.

       <b>-L, --copy-links</b>
              When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to
              (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink.  In older
              versions of rsync, this option also had the side-effect of
              telling the receiving side to follow symlinks, such as
              symlinks to directories.  In a modern rsync such as this one,
              you’ll need to specify <b>--keep-dirlinks </b>(<b>-K</b>) to get this extra
              behavior.  The only exception is when sending files to an
              rsync that is too old to understand <b>-K </b>-- in that case, the <b>-L</b>
              option will still have the side-effect of <b>-K </b>on that older
              receiving rsync.

       <b>--copy-unsafe-links</b>
              This tells rsync to copy the referent of symbolic links that
              point outside the copied tree.  Absolute symlinks are also
              treated like ordinary files, and so are any symlinks in the
              source path itself when <b>--relative </b>is used.  This option has
              no additional effect if <b>--copy-links </b>was also specified.

       <b>--safe-links</b>
              This tells rsync to ignore any symbolic links which point
              outside the copied tree. All absolute symlinks are also
              ignored. Using this option in conjunction with <b>--relative </b>may
              give unexpected results.

       <b>--munge-links</b>
              This option tells rsync to (1) modify all symlinks on the
              receiving side in a way that makes them unusable but
              recoverable (see below), or (2) to unmunge symlinks on the
              sending side that had been stored in a munged state.  This is
              useful if you don’t quite trust the source of the data to not
              try to slip in a symlink to a unexpected place.

              The way rsync disables the use of symlinks is to prefix each
              one with the string "/rsyncd-munged/".  This prevents the
              links from being used as long as that directory does not
              exist.  When this option is enabled, rsync will refuse to run
              if that path is a directory or a symlink to a directory.

              The option only affects the client side of the transfer, so if
              you need it to affect the server, specify it via
              <b>--remote-option</b>.  (Note that in a local transfer, the client
              side is the sender.)

              This option has no affect on a daemon, since the daemon
              configures whether it wants munged symlinks via its "munge
              symlinks" parameter.  See also the "munge-symlinks" perl
              script in the support directory of the source code.

       <b>-k, --copy-dirlinks</b>
              This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a
              directory as though it were a real directory.  This is useful
              if you don’t want symlinks to non-directories to be affected,
              as they would be using <b>--copy-links</b>.

              Without this option, if the sending side has replaced a
              directory with a symlink to a directory, the receiving side
              will delete anything that is in the way of the new symlink,
              including a directory hierarchy (as long as <b>--force </b>or
              <b>--delete </b>is in effect).

              See also <b>--keep-dirlinks </b>for an analogous option for the
              receiving side.

              <b>--copy-dirlinks </b>applies to all symlinks to directories in the
              source.  If you want to follow only a few specified symlinks,
              a trick you can use is to pass them as additional source args
              with a trailing slash, using <b>--relative </b>to make the paths
              match up right.  For example:

              rsync -r --relative src/./ src/./follow-me/ dest/

              This works because rsync calls <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a> on the source arg as
              given, and the trailing slash makes <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a> follow the
              symlink, giving rise to a directory in the file-list which
              overrides the symlink found during the scan of "src/./".

       <b>-K, --keep-dirlinks</b>
              This option causes the receiving side to treat a symlink to a
              directory as though it were a real directory, but only if it
              matches a real directory from the sender.  Without this
              option, the receiver’s symlink would be deleted and replaced
              with a real directory.

              For example, suppose you transfer a directory "foo" that
              contains a file "file", but "foo" is a symlink to directory
              "bar" on the receiver.  Without <b>--keep-dirlinks</b>, the receiver
              deletes symlink "foo", recreates it as a directory, and
              receives the file into the new directory.  With
              <b>--keep-dirlinks</b>, the receiver keeps the symlink and "file"
              ends up in "bar".

              One note of caution:  if you use <b>--keep-dirlinks</b>, you must
              trust all the symlinks in the copy!  If it is possible for an
              untrusted user to create their own symlink to any directory,
              the user could then (on a subsequent copy) replace the symlink
              with a real directory and affect the content of whatever
              directory the symlink references.  For backup copies, you are
              better off using something like a bind mount instead of a
              symlink to modify your receiving hierarchy.

              See also <b>--copy-dirlinks </b>for an analogous option for the
              sending side.

       <b>-H, --hard-links</b>
              This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the source
              and link together the corresponding files on the destination.
              Without this option, hard-linked files in the source are
              treated as though they were separate files.

              This option does NOT necessarily ensure that the pattern of
              hard links on the destination exactly matches that on the
              source.  Cases in which the destination may end up with extra
              hard links include the following:

              o      If the destination contains extraneous hard-links (more
                     linking than what is present in the source file list),
                     the copying algorithm will not break them explicitly.
                     However, if one or more of the paths have content
                     differences, the normal file-update process will break
                     those extra links (unless you are using the <b>--inplace</b>
                     option).

              o      If you specify a <b>--link-dest </b>directory that contains
                     hard links, the linking of the destination files
                     against the <b>--link-dest </b>files can cause some paths in
                     the destination to become linked together due to the
                     <b>--link-dest </b>associations.

              Note that rsync can only detect hard links between files that
              are inside the transfer set.  If rsync updates a file that has
              extra hard-link connections to files outside the transfer,
              that linkage will be broken.  If you are tempted to use the
              <b>--inplace </b>option to avoid this breakage, be very careful that
              you know how your files are being updated so that you are
              certain that no unintended changes happen due to lingering
              hard links (and see the <b>--inplace </b>option for more caveats).

              If incremental recursion is active (see <b>--recursive</b>), rsync
              may transfer a missing hard-linked file before it finds that
              another link for that contents exists elsewhere in the
              hierarchy.  This does not affect the accuracy of the transfer
              (i.e. which files are hard-linked together), just its
              efficiency (i.e. copying the data for a new, early copy of a
              hard-linked file that could have been found later in the
              transfer in another member of the hard-linked set of files).
              One way to avoid this inefficiency is to disable incremental
              recursion using the <b>--no-inc-recursive </b>option.

       <b>-p, --perms</b>
              This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination
              permissions to be the same as the source permissions.  (See
              also the <b>--chmod </b>option for a way to modify what rsync
              considers to be the source permissions.)

              When this option is <i>off</i>, permissions are set as follows:

              o      Existing files (including updated files) retain their
                     existing permissions, though the <b>--executability </b>option
                     might change just the execute permission for the file.

              o      New files get their "normal" permission bits set to the
                     source file’s permissions masked with the receiving
                     directory’s default permissions (either the receiving
                     process’s umask, or the permissions specified via the
                     destination directory’s default ACL), and their special
                     permission bits disabled except in the case where a new
                     directory inherits a setgid bit from its parent
                     directory.

              Thus, when <b>--perms </b>and <b>--executability </b>are both disabled,
              rsync’s behavior is the same as that of other file-copy
              utilities, such as <a href="cp.1.html">cp(1)</a> and <a href="tar.1.html">tar(1)</a>.

              In summary: to give destination files (both old and new) the
              source permissions, use <b>--perms</b>.  To give new files the
              destination-default permissions (while leaving existing files
              unchanged), make sure that the <b>--perms </b>option is off and use
              <b>--chmod=ugo=rwX </b>(which ensures that all non-masked bits get
              enabled).  If you’d care to make this latter behavior easier
              to type, you could define a popt alias for it, such as putting
              this line in the file ~/.popt (the following defines the <b>-Z</b>
              option, and includes --no-g to use the default group of the
              destination dir):

                 rsync alias -Z --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX

              You could then use this new option in a command such as this
              one:

                 rsync -avZ src/ dest/

              (Caveat: make sure that <b>-a </b>does not follow <b>-Z</b>, or it will
              re-enable the two "--no-*" options mentioned above.)

              The preservation of the destination’s setgid bit on
              newly-created directories when <b>--perms </b>is off was added in
              rsync 2.6.7.  Older rsync versions erroneously preserved the
              three special permission bits for newly-created files when
              <b>--perms </b>was off, while overriding the destination’s setgid bit
              setting on a newly-created directory.  Default ACL observance
              was added to the ACL patch for rsync 2.6.7, so older (or
              non-ACL-enabled) rsyncs use the umask even if default ACLs are
              present.  (Keep in mind that it is the version of the
              receiving rsync that affects these behaviors.)

       <b>-E, --executability</b>
              This option causes rsync to preserve the executability (or
              non-executability) of regular files when <b>--perms </b>is not
              enabled.  A regular file is considered to be executable if at
              least one ’x’ is turned on in its permissions.  When an
              existing destination file’s executability differs from that of
              the corresponding source file, rsync modifies the destination
              file’s permissions as follows:

              o      To make a file non-executable, rsync turns off all its
                     ’x’ permissions.

              o      To make a file executable, rsync turns on each ’x’
                     permission that has a corresponding ’r’ permission
                     enabled.

              If <b>--perms </b>is enabled, this option is ignored.

       <b>-A, --acls</b>
              This option causes rsync to update the destination ACLs to be
              the same as the source ACLs.  The option also implies <b>--perms</b>.

              The source and destination systems must have compatible ACL
              entries for this option to work properly.  See the
              <b>--fake-super </b>option for a way to backup and restore ACLs that
              are not compatible.

       <b>-X, --xattrs</b>
              This option causes rsync to update the destination extended
              attributes to be the same as the source ones.

              For systems that support extended-attribute namespaces, a copy
              being done by a super-user copies all namespaces except
              system.*.  A normal user only copies the user.* namespace.  To
              be able to backup and restore non-user namespaces as a normal
              user, see the <b>--fake-super </b>option.

              Note that this option does not copy rsyncs special xattr
              values (e.g. those used by <b>--fake-super</b>) unless you repeat the
              option (e.g. -XX).  This "copy all xattrs" mode cannot be used
              with <b>--fake-super</b>.

       <b>--chmod</b>
              This option tells rsync to apply one or more comma-separated
              "chmod" modes to the permission of the files in the transfer.
              The resulting value is treated as though it were the
              permissions that the sending side supplied for the file, which
              means that this option can seem to have no effect on existing
              files if <b>--perms </b>is not enabled.

              In addition to the normal parsing rules specified in the
              <a href="chmod.1.html">chmod(1)</a> manpage, you can specify an item that should only
              apply to a directory by prefixing it with a ’D’, or specify an
              item that should only apply to a file by prefixing it with a
              ’F’.  For example, the following will ensure that all
              directories get marked set-gid, that no files are
              other-writable, that both are user-writable and
              group-writable, and that both have consistent executability
              across all bits:

              --chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,Fo-w,+X

              Using octal mode numbers is also allowed:

              --chmod=D2775,F664

              It is also legal to specify multiple <b>--chmod </b>options, as each
              additional option is just appended to the list of changes to
              make.

              See the <b>--perms </b>and <b>--executability </b>options for how the
              resulting permission value can be applied to the files in the
              transfer.

       <b>-o, --owner</b>
              This option causes rsync to set the owner of the destination
              file to be the same as the source file, but only if the
              receiving rsync is being run as the super-user (see also the
              <b>--super </b>and <b>--fake-super </b>options).  Without this option, the
              owner of new and/or transferred files are set to the invoking
              user on the receiving side.

              The preservation of ownership will associate matching names by
              default, but may fall back to using the ID number in some
              circumstances (see also the <b>--numeric-ids </b>option for a full
              discussion).

       <b>-g, --group</b>
              This option causes rsync to set the group of the destination
              file to be the same as the source file.  If the receiving
              program is not running as the super-user (or if <b>--no-super </b>was
              specified), only groups that the invoking user on the
              receiving side is a member of will be preserved.  Without this
              option, the group is set to the default group of the invoking
              user on the receiving side.

              The preservation of group information will associate matching
              names by default, but may fall back to using the ID number in
              some circumstances (see also the <b>--numeric-ids </b>option for a
              full discussion).

       <b>--devices</b>
              This option causes rsync to transfer character and block
              device files to the remote system to recreate these devices.
              This option has no effect if the receiving rsync is not run as
              the super-user (see also the <b>--super </b>and <b>--fake-super</b>
              options).

       <b>--specials</b>
              This option causes rsync to transfer special files such as
              named sockets and fifos.

       <b>-D     </b>The <b>-D </b>option is equivalent to <b>--devices --specials</b>.

       <b>-t, --times</b>
              This tells rsync to transfer modification times along with the
              files and update them on the remote system.  Note that if this
              option is not used, the optimization that excludes files that
              have not been modified cannot be effective; in other words, a
              missing <b>-t </b>or <b>-a </b>will cause the next transfer to behave as if
              it used <b>-I</b>, causing all files to be updated (though rsync’s
              delta-transfer algorithm will make the update fairly efficient
              if the files haven’t actually changed, you’re much better off
              using <b>-t</b>).

       <b>-O, --omit-dir-times</b>
              This tells rsync to omit directories when it is preserving
              modification times (see <b>--times</b>).  If NFS is sharing the
              directories on the receiving side, it is a good idea to use
              <b>-O</b>.  This option is inferred if you use <b>--backup </b>without
              <b>--backup-dir</b>.

              This option also has the side-effect of avoiding early
              creation of directories in incremental recursion copies.  The
              default <b>--inc-recursive </b>copying normally does an early-create
              pass of all the sub-directories in a parent directory in order
              for it to be able to then set the modify time of the parent
              directory right away (without having to delay that until a
              bunch of recursive copying has finished).  This early-create
              idiom is not necessary if directory modify times are not being
              preserved, so it is skipped.  Since early-create directories
              don’t have accurate mode, mtime, or ownership, the use of this
              option can help when someone wants to avoid these
              partially-finished directories.

       <b>-J, --omit-link-times</b>
              This tells rsync to omit symlinks when it is preserving
              modification times (see <b>--times</b>).

       <b>--super</b>
              This tells the receiving side to attempt super-user activities
              even if the receiving rsync wasn’t run by the super-user.
              These activities include: preserving users via the <b>--owner</b>
              option, preserving all groups (not just the current user’s
              groups) via the <b>--groups </b>option, and copying devices via the
              <b>--devices </b>option.  This is useful for systems that allow such
              activities without being the super-user, and also for ensuring
              that you will get errors if the receiving side isn’t being run
              as the super-user.  To turn off super-user activities, the
              super-user can use <b>--no-super</b>.

       <b>--fake-super</b>
              When this option is enabled, rsync simulates super-user
              activities by saving/restoring the privileged attributes via
              special extended attributes that are attached to each file (as
              needed).  This includes the file’s owner and group (if it is
              not the default), the file’s device info (device &amp; special
              files are created as empty text files), and any permission
              bits that we won’t allow to be set on the real file (e.g.  the
              real file gets u-s,g-s,o-t for safety) or that would limit the
              owner’s access (since the real super-user can always
              access/change a file, the files we create can always be
              accessed/changed by the creating user).  This option also
              handles ACLs (if <b>--acls </b>was specified) and non-user extended
              attributes (if <b>--xattrs </b>was specified).

              This is a good way to backup data without using a super-user,
              and to store ACLs from incompatible systems.

              The <b>--fake-super </b>option only affects the side where the option
              is used.  To affect the remote side of a remote-shell
              connection, use the <b>--remote-option </b>(<b>-M</b>) option:

                rsync -av -M--fake-super /src/ host:/dest/

              For a local copy, this option affects both the source and the
              destination.  If you wish a local copy to enable this option
              just for the destination files, specify <b>-M--fake-super</b>.  If
              you wish a local copy to enable this option just for the
              source files, combine <b>--fake-super </b>with <b>-M--super</b>.

              This option is overridden by both <b>--super </b>and <b>--no-super</b>.

              See also the "fake super" setting in the daemon’s rsyncd.conf
              file.

       <b>-S, --sparse</b>
              Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less
              space on the destination.  Conflicts with <b>--inplace </b>because
              it’s not possible to overwrite data in a sparse fashion.

       <b>--preallocate</b>
              This tells the receiver to allocate each destination file to
              its eventual size before writing data to the file.  Rsync will
              only use the real filesystem-level preallocation support
              provided by Linux’s <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> system call or Cygwin’s
              <a href="../man3/posix_fallocate.3.html">posix_fallocate(3)</a>, not the slow glibc implementation that
              writes a zero byte into each block.

              Without this option, larger files may not be entirely
              contiguous on the filesystem, but with this option rsync will
              probably copy more slowly.  If the destination is not an
              extent-supporting filesystem (such as ext4, xfs, NTFS, etc.),
              this option may have no positive effect at all.

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              This makes rsync perform a trial run that doesn’t make any
              changes (and produces mostly the same output as a real run).
              It is most commonly used in combination with the <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              and/or <b>-i, --itemize-changes </b>options to see what an rsync
              command is going to do before one actually runs it.

              The output of <b>--itemize-changes </b>is supposed to be exactly the
              same on a dry run and a subsequent real run (barring
              intentional trickery and system call failures); if it isn’t,
              that’s a bug.  Other output should be mostly unchanged, but
              may differ in some areas.  Notably, a dry run does not send
              the actual data for file transfers, so <b>--progress </b>has no
              effect, the "bytes sent", "bytes received", "literal data",
              and "matched data" statistics are too small, and the "speedup"
              value is equivalent to a run where no file transfers were
              needed.

       <b>-W, --whole-file</b>
              With this option rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm is not used
              and the whole file is sent as-is instead.  The transfer may be
              faster if this option is used when the bandwidth between the
              source and destination machines is higher than the bandwidth
              to disk (especially when the "disk" is actually a networked
              filesystem).  This is the default when both the source and
              destination are specified as local paths, but only if no
              batch-writing option is in effect.

       <b>-x, --one-file-system</b>
              This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when
              recursing.  This does not limit the user’s ability to specify
              items to copy from multiple filesystems, just rsync’s
              recursion through the hierarchy of each directory that the
              user specified, and also the analogous recursion on the
              receiving side during deletion.  Also keep in mind that rsync
              treats a "bind" mount to the same device as being on the same
              filesystem.

              If this option is repeated, rsync omits all mount-point
              directories from the copy.  Otherwise, it includes an empty
              directory at each mount-point it encounters (using the
              attributes of the mounted directory because those of the
              underlying mount-point directory are inaccessible).

              If rsync has been told to collapse symlinks (via <b>--copy-links</b>
              or <b>--copy-unsafe-links</b>), a symlink to a directory on another
              device is treated like a mount-point.  Symlinks to
              non-directories are unaffected by this option.

       <b>--existing, --ignore-non-existing</b>
              This tells rsync to skip creating files (including
              directories) that do not exist yet on the destination.  If
              this option is combined with the <b>--ignore-existing </b>option, no
              files will be updated (which can be useful if all you want to
              do is delete extraneous files).

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t
              affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it
              doesn’t affect deletions.  It just limits the files that the
              receiver requests to be transferred.

       <b>--ignore-existing</b>
              This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on
              the destination (this does <i>not</i> ignore existing directories, or
              nothing would get done).  See also <b>--existing</b>.

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t
              affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it
              doesn’t affect deletions.  It just limits the files that the
              receiver requests to be transferred.

              This option can be useful for those doing backups using the
              <b>--link-dest </b>option when they need to continue a backup run
              that got interrupted.  Since a <b>--link-dest </b>run is copied into
              a new directory hierarchy (when it is used properly), using
              <b>--ignore existing </b>will ensure that the already-handled files
              don’t get tweaked (which avoids a change in permissions on the
              hard-linked files).  This does mean that this option is only
              looking at the existing files in the destination hierarchy
              itself.

       <b>--remove-source-files</b>
              This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files
              (meaning non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and
              have been successfully duplicated on the receiving side.

              Note that you should only use this option on source files that
              are quiescent.  If you are using this to move files that show
              up in a particular directory over to another host, make sure
              that the finished files get renamed into the source directory,
              not directly written into it, so that rsync can’t possibly
              transfer a file that is not yet fully written.  If you can’t
              first write the files into a different directory, you should
              use a naming idiom that lets rsync avoid transferring files
              that are not yet finished (e.g. name the file "foo.new" when
              it is written, rename it to "foo" when it is done, and then
              use the option <b>--exclude='*.new' </b>for the rsync transfer).

              Starting with 3.1.0, rsync will skip the sender-side removal
              (and output an error) if the file’s size or modify time has
              not stayed unchanged.

       <b>--delete</b>
              This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving
              side (ones that aren’t on the sending side), but only for the
              directories that are being synchronized.  You must have asked
              rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. "dir" or "dir/")
              without using a wildcard for the directory’s contents (e.g.
              "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync
              thus gets a request to transfer individual files, not the
              files’ parent directory.  Files that are excluded from the
              transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless you use
              the <b>--delete-excluded </b>option or mark the rules as only
              matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude
              modifiers in the FILTER RULES section).

              Prior to rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless
              <b>--recursive </b>was enabled.  Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will
              also occur when <b>--dirs </b>(<b>-d</b>) is enabled, but only for
              directories whose contents are being copied.

              This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly!  It is a
              very good idea to first try a run using the <b>--dry-run </b>option
              (<b>-n</b>) to see what files are going to be deleted.

              If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion
              of any files at the destination will be automatically
              disabled. This is to prevent temporary filesystem failures
              (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from causing a
              massive deletion of files on the destination.  You can
              override this with the <b>--ignore-errors </b>option.

              The <b>--delete </b>option may be combined with one of the
              --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as
              <b>--delete-excluded</b>.  However, if none of the --delete-WHEN
              options are specified, rsync will choose the <b>--delete-during</b>
              algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0 or newer, and the
              <b>--delete-before </b>algorithm when talking to an older rsync.  See
              also <b>--delete-delay </b>and <b>--delete-after</b>.

       <b>--delete-before</b>
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done
              before the transfer starts.  See <b>--delete </b>(which is implied)
              for more details on file-deletion.

              Deleting before the transfer is helpful if the filesystem is
              tight for space and removing extraneous files would help to
              make the transfer possible.  However, it does introduce a
              delay before the start of the transfer, and this delay might
              cause the transfer to timeout (if <b>--timeout </b>was specified).
              It also forces rsync to use the old, non-incremental recursion
              algorithm that requires rsync to scan all the files in the
              transfer into memory at once (see <b>--recursive</b>).

       <b>--delete-during, --del</b>
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done
              incrementally as the transfer happens.  The per-directory
              delete scan is done right before each directory is checked for
              updates, so it behaves like a more efficient <b>--delete-before</b>,
              including doing the deletions prior to any per-directory
              filter files being updated.  This option was first added in
              rsync version 2.6.4.  See <b>--delete </b>(which is implied) for more
              details on file-deletion.

       <b>--delete-delay</b>
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be
              computed during the transfer (like <b>--delete-during</b>), and then
              removed after the transfer completes.  This is useful when
              combined with <b>--delay-updates </b>and/or <b>--fuzzy</b>, and is more
              efficient than using <b>--delete-after </b>(but can behave
              differently, since <b>--delete-after </b>computes the deletions in a
              separate pass after all updates are done).  If the number of
              removed files overflows an internal buffer, a temporary file
              will be created on the receiving side to hold the names (it is
              removed while open, so you shouldn’t see it during the
              transfer).  If the creation of the temporary file fails, rsync
              will try to fall back to using <b>--delete-after </b>(which it cannot
              do if <b>--recursive </b>is doing an incremental scan).  See <b>--delete</b>
              (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.

       <b>--delete-after</b>
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done
              after the transfer has completed.  This is useful if you are
              sending new per-directory merge files as a part of the
              transfer and you want their exclusions to take effect for the
              delete phase of the current transfer.  It also forces rsync to
              use the old, non-incremental recursion algorithm that requires
              rsync to scan all the files in the transfer into memory at
              once (see <b>--recursive</b>).  See <b>--delete </b>(which is implied) for
              more details on file-deletion.

       <b>--delete-excluded</b>
              In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that
              are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete
              any files on the receiving side that are excluded (see
              <b>--exclude</b>).  See the FILTER RULES section for a way to make
              individual exclusions behave this way on the receiver, and for
              a way to protect files from <b>--delete-excluded</b>.  See <b>--delete</b>
              (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.

       <b>--ignore-missing-args</b>
              When rsync is first processing the explicitly requested source
              files (e.g. command-line arguments or <b>--files-from </b>entries),
              it is normally an error if the file cannot be found.  This
              option suppresses that error, and does not try to transfer the
              file.  This does not affect subsequent vanished-file errors if
              a file was initially found to be present and later is no
              longer there.

       <b>--delete-missing-args</b>
              This option takes the behavior of (the implied)
              <b>--ignore-missing-args </b>option a step farther:  each missing arg
              will become a deletion request of the corresponding
              destination file on the receiving side (should it exist).  If
              the destination file is a non-empty directory, it will only be
              successfully deleted if --force or --delete are in effect.
              Other than that, this option is independent of any other type
              of delete processing.

              The missing source files are represented by special file-list
              entries which display as a "*missing" entry in the <b>--list-only</b>
              output.

       <b>--ignore-errors</b>
              Tells <b>--delete </b>to go ahead and delete files even when there
              are I/O errors.

       <b>--force</b>
              This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when
              it is to be replaced by a non-directory.  This is only
              relevant if deletions are not active (see <b>--delete </b>for
              details).

              Note for older rsync versions: <b>--force </b>used to still be
              required when using <b>--delete-after</b>, and it used to be
              non-functional unless the <b>--recursive </b>option was also enabled.

       <b>--max-delete=NUM</b>
              This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or
              directories.  If that limit is exceeded, all further deletions
              are skipped through the end of the transfer.  At the end,
              rsync outputs a warning (including a count of the skipped
              deletions) and exits with an error code of 25 (unless some
              more important error condition also occurred).

              Beginning with version 3.0.0, you may specify <b>--max-delete=0</b>
              to be warned about any extraneous files in the destination
              without removing any of them.  Older clients interpreted this
              as "unlimited", so if you don’t know what version the client
              is, you can use the less obvious <b>--max-delete=-1 </b>as a
              backward-compatible way to specify that no deletions be
              allowed (though really old versions didn’t warn when the limit
              was exceeded).

       <b>--max-size=SIZE</b>
              This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is larger
              than the specified SIZE. The SIZE value can be suffixed with a
              string to indicate a size multiplier, and may be a fractional
              value (e.g. "<b>--max-size=1.5m</b>").

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t
              affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it
              doesn’t affect deletions.  It just limits the files that the
              receiver requests to be transferred.

              The suffixes are as follows: "K" (or "KiB") is a kibibyte
              (1024), "M" (or "MiB") is a mebibyte (1024*1024), and "G" (or
              "GiB") is a gibibyte (1024*1024*1024).  If you want the
              multiplier to be 1000 instead of 1024, use "KB", "MB", or
              "GB".  (Note: lower-case is also accepted for all values.)
              Finally, if the suffix ends in either "+1" or "-1", the value
              will be offset by one byte in the indicated direction.

              Examples: --max-size=1.5mb-1 is 1499999 bytes, and
              --max-size=2g+1 is 2147483649 bytes.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow
              <b>--max-size=0</b>.

       <b>--min-size=SIZE</b>
              This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is
              smaller than the specified SIZE, which can help in not
              transferring small, junk files.  See the <b>--max-size </b>option for
              a description of SIZE and other information.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow
              <b>--min-size=0</b>.

       <b>-B, --block-size=BLOCKSIZE</b>
              This forces the block size used in rsync’s delta-transfer
              algorithm to a fixed value.  It is normally selected based on
              the size of each file being updated.  See the technical report
              for details.

       <b>-e, --rsh=COMMAND</b>
              This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell
              program to use for communication between the local and remote
              copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is configured to use ssh by
              default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.

              If this option is used with <b>[user@]host::module/path</b>, then the
              remote shell <i>COMMAND</i> will be used to run an rsync daemon on
              the remote host, and all data will be transmitted through that
              remote shell connection, rather than through a direct socket
              connection to a running rsync daemon on the remote host.  See
              the section "USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL
              CONNECTION" above.

              Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that
              COMMAND is presented to rsync as a single argument.  You must
              use spaces (not tabs or other whitespace) to separate the
              command and args from each other, and you can use single-
              and/or double-quotes to preserve spaces in an argument (but
              not backslashes).  Note that doubling a single-quote inside a
              single-quoted string gives you a single-quote; likewise for
              double-quotes (though you need to pay attention to which
              quotes your shell is parsing and which quotes rsync is
              parsing).  Some examples:

                  -e 'ssh -p 2234'
                  -e 'ssh -o "ProxyCommand nohup ssh firewall nc -w1 %h %p"'

              (Note that ssh users can alternately customize site-specific
              connect options in their .ssh/config file.)

              You can also choose the remote shell program using the
              RSYNC_RSH environment variable, which accepts the same range
              of values as <b>-e</b>.

              See also the <b>--blocking-io </b>option which is affected by this
              option.

       <b>--rsync-path=PROGRAM</b>
              Use this to specify what program is to be run on the remote
              machine to start-up rsync.  Often used when rsync is not in
              the default remote-shell’s path (e.g.
              --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).  Note that PROGRAM is run
              with the help of a shell, so it can be any program, script, or
              command sequence you’d care to run, so long as it does not
              corrupt the standard-in &amp; standard-out that rsync is using to
              communicate.

              One tricky example is to set a different default directory on
              the remote machine for use with the <b>--relative </b>option.  For
              instance:

                  rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /a/b &amp;&amp; rsync" host:c/d /e/

       <b>-M, --remote-option=OPTION</b>
              This option is used for more advanced situations where you
              want certain effects to be limited to one side of the transfer
              only.  For instance, if you want to pass <b>--log-file=FILE </b>and
              <b>--fake-super </b>to the remote system, specify it like this:

                  rsync -av -M --log-file=foo -M--fake-super src/ dest/

              If you want to have an option affect only the local side of a
              transfer when it normally affects both sides, send its
              negation to the remote side.  Like this:

                  rsync -av -x -M--no-x src/ dest/

              Be cautious using this, as it is possible to toggle an option
              that will cause rsync to have a different idea about what data
              to expect next over the socket, and that will make it fail in
              a cryptic fashion.

              Note that it is best to use a separate <b>--remote-option </b>for
              each option you want to pass.  This makes your useage
              compatible with the <b>--protect-args </b>option.  If that option is
              off, any spaces in your remote options will be split by the
              remote shell unless you take steps to protect them.

              When performing a local transfer, the "local" side is the
              sender and the "remote" side is the receiver.

              Note some versions of the popt option-parsing library have a
              bug in them that prevents you from using an adjacent arg with
              an equal in it next to a short option letter (e.g.
              -M--log-file=/tmp/foo.  If this bug affects your version of
              popt, you can use the version of popt that is included with
              rsync.

       <b>-C, --cvs-exclude</b>
              This is a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of
              files that you often don’t want to transfer between systems.
              It uses a similar algorithm to CVS to determine if a file
              should be ignored.

              The exclude list is initialized to exclude the following items
              (these initial items are marked as perishable -- see the
              FILTER RULES section):

                     RCS SCCS CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.* tags TAGS
                     .make.state .nse_depinfo *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old
                     *.bak *.BAK *.orig *.rej .del-* *.a *.olb *.o *.obj
                     *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc *.ln core .svn/ .git/ .hg/ .bzr/

              then, files listed in a $HOME/.cvsignore are added to the list
              and any files listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable
              (all cvsignore names are delimited by whitespace).

              Finally, any file is ignored if it is in the same directory as
              a .cvsignore file and matches one of the patterns listed
              therein.  Unlike rsync’s filter/exclude files, these patterns
              are split on whitespace.  See the <b>cvs</b>(1) manual for more
              information.

              If you’re combining <b>-C </b>with your own <b>--filter </b>rules, you
              should note that these CVS excludes are appended at the end of
              your own rules, regardless of where the <b>-C </b>was placed on the
              command-line.  This makes them a lower priority than any rules
              you specified explicitly.  If you want to control where these
              CVS excludes get inserted into your filter rules, you should
              omit the <b>-C </b>as a command-line option and use a combination of
              <b>--filter=:C </b>and <b>--filter=-C </b>(either on your command-line or by
              putting the ":C" and "-C" rules into a filter file with your
              other rules).  The first option turns on the per-directory
              scanning for the .cvsignore file.  The second option does a
              one-time import of the CVS excludes mentioned above.

       <b>-f, --filter=RULE</b>
              This option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude
              certain files from the list of files to be transferred. This
              is most useful in combination with a recursive transfer.

              You may use as many <b>--filter </b>options on the command line as
              you like to build up the list of files to exclude.  If the
              filter contains whitespace, be sure to quote it so that the
              shell gives the rule to rsync as a single argument.  The text
              below also mentions that you can use an underscore to replace
              the space that separates a rule from its arg.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this
              option.

       <b>-F     </b>The <b>-F </b>option is a shorthand for adding two <b>--filter </b>rules to
              your command.  The first time it is used is a shorthand for
              this rule:

                 --filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'

              This tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files
              that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their
              rules to filter the files in the transfer.  If <b>-F </b>is repeated,
              it is a shorthand for this rule:

                 --filter='exclude .rsync-filter'

              This filters out the .rsync-filter files themselves from the
              transfer.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on how
              these options work.

       <b>--exclude=PATTERN</b>
              This option is a simplified form of the <b>--filter </b>option that
              defaults to an exclude rule and does not allow the full
              rule-parsing syntax of normal filter rules.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this
              option.

       <b>--exclude-from=FILE</b>
              This option is related to the <b>--exclude </b>option, but it
              specifies a FILE that contains exclude patterns (one per
              line).  Blank lines in the file and lines starting with ’;’ or
              ’#’ are ignored.  If <i>FILE</i> is <b>-</b>, the list will be read from
              standard input.

       <b>--include=PATTERN</b>
              This option is a simplified form of the <b>--filter </b>option that
              defaults to an include rule and does not allow the full
              rule-parsing syntax of normal filter rules.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this
              option.

       <b>--include-from=FILE</b>
              This option is related to the <b>--include </b>option, but it
              specifies a FILE that contains include patterns (one per
              line).  Blank lines in the file and lines starting with ’;’ or
              ’#’ are ignored.  If <i>FILE</i> is <b>-</b>, the list will be read from
              standard input.

       <b>--files-from=FILE</b>
              Using this option allows you to specify the exact list of
              files to transfer (as read from the specified FILE or <b>- </b>for
              standard input).  It also tweaks the default behavior of rsync
              to make transferring just the specified files and directories
              easier:

              o      The <b>--relative </b>(<b>-R</b>) option is implied, which preserves
                     the path information that is specified for each item in
                     the file (use <b>--no-relative </b>or <b>--no-R </b>if you want to
                     turn that off).

              o      The <b>--dirs </b>(<b>-d</b>) option is implied, which will create
                     directories specified in the list on the destination
                     rather than noisily skipping them (use <b>--no-dirs </b>or
                     <b>--no-d </b>if you want to turn that off).

              o      The <b>--archive </b>(<b>-a</b>) option’s behavior does not imply
                     <b>--recursive </b>(<b>-r</b>), so specify it explicitly, if you want
                     it.

              o      These side-effects change the default state of rsync,
                     so the position of the <b>--files-from </b>option on the
                     command-line has no bearing on how other options are
                     parsed (e.g. <b>-a </b>works the same before or after
                     <b>--files-from</b>, as does <b>--no-R </b>and all other options).

              The filenames that are read from the FILE are all relative to
              the source dir -- any leading slashes are removed and no ".."
              references are allowed to go higher than the source dir.  For
              example, take this command:

                 rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup

              If /tmp/foo contains the string "bin" (or even "/bin"), the
              /usr/bin directory will be created as /backup/bin on the
              remote host.  If it contains "bin/" (note the trailing slash),
              the immediate contents of the directory would also be sent
              (without needing to be explicitly mentioned in the file --
              this began in version 2.6.4).  In both cases, if the <b>-r </b>option
              was enabled, that dir’s entire hierarchy would also be
              transferred (keep in mind that <b>-r </b>needs to be specified
              explicitly with <b>--files-from</b>, since it is not implied by <b>-a</b>).
              Also note that the effect of the (enabled by default)
              <b>--relative </b>option is to duplicate only the path info that is
              read from the file -- it does not force the duplication of the
              source-spec path (/usr in this case).

              In addition, the <b>--files-from </b>file can be read from the remote
              host instead of the local host if you specify a "host:" in
              front of the file (the host must match one end of the
              transfer).  As a short-cut, you can specify just a prefix of
              ":" to mean "use the remote end of the transfer".  For
              example:

                 rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy

              This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list
              file that was located on the remote "src" host.

              If the <b>--iconv </b>and <b>--protect-args </b>options are specified and
              the <b>--files-from </b>filenames are being sent from one host to
              another, the filenames will be translated from the sending
              host’s charset to the receiving host’s charset.

              NOTE: sorting the list of files in the --files-from input
              helps rsync to be more efficient, as it will avoid re-visiting
              the path elements that are shared between adjacent entries.
              If the input is not sorted, some path elements (implied
              directories) may end up being scanned multiple times, and
              rsync will eventually unduplicate them after they get turned
              into file-list elements.

       <b>-0, --from0</b>
              This tells rsync that the rules/filenames it reads from a file
              are terminated by a null (’\0’) character, not a NL, CR, or
              CR+LF.  This affects <b>--exclude-from</b>, <b>--include-from</b>,
              <b>--files-from</b>, and any merged files specified in a <b>--filter</b>
              rule.  It does not affect <b>--cvs-exclude </b>(since all names read
              from a .cvsignore file are split on whitespace).

       <b>-s, --protect-args</b>
              This option sends all filenames and most options to the remote
              rsync without allowing the remote shell to interpret them.
              This means that spaces are not split in names, and any
              non-wildcard special characters are not translated (such as ~,
              $, ;, &amp;, etc.).  Wildcards are expanded on the remote host by
              rsync (instead of the shell doing it).

              If you use this option with <b>--iconv</b>, the args related to the
              remote side will also be translated from the local to the
              remote character-set.  The translation happens before
              wild-cards are expanded.  See also the <b>--files-from </b>option.

              You may also control this option via the RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS
              environment variable.  If this variable has a non-zero value,
              this option will be enabled by default, otherwise it will be
              disabled by default.  Either state is overridden by a manually
              specified positive or negative version of this option (note
              that <b>--no-s </b>and <b>--no-protect-args </b>are the negative versions).
              Since this option was first introduced in 3.0.0, you’ll need
              to make sure it’s disabled if you ever need to interact with a
              remote rsync that is older than that.

              Rsync can also be configured (at build time) to have this
              option enabled by default (with is overridden by both the
              environment and the command-line).  This option will
              eventually become a new default setting at some
              as-yet-undetermined point in the future.

       <b>-T, --temp-dir=DIR</b>
              This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a scratch directory
              when creating temporary copies of the files transferred on the
              receiving side.  The default behavior is to create each
              temporary file in the same directory as the associated
              destination file.  Beginning with rsync 3.1.1, the temp-file
              names inside the specified DIR will not be prefixed with an
              extra dot (though they will still have a random suffix added).

              This option is most often used when the receiving disk
              partition does not have enough free space to hold a copy of
              the largest file in the transfer.  In this case (i.e. when the
              scratch directory is on a different disk partition), rsync
              will not be able to rename each received temporary file over
              the top of the associated destination file, but instead must
              copy it into place.  Rsync does this by copying the file over
              the top of the destination file, which means that the
              destination file will contain truncated data during this copy.
              If this were not done this way (even if the destination file
              were first removed, the data locally copied to a temporary
              file in the destination directory, and then renamed into
              place) it would be possible for the old file to continue
              taking up disk space (if someone had it open), and thus there
              might not be enough room to fit the new version on the disk at
              the same time.

              If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage
              of disk space, you may wish to combine it with the
              <b>--delay-updates </b>option, which will ensure that all copied
              files get put into subdirectories in the destination
              hierarchy, awaiting the end of the transfer.  If you don’t
              have enough room to duplicate all the arriving files on the
              destination partition, another way to tell rsync that you
              aren’t overly concerned about disk space is to use the
              <b>--partial-dir </b>option with a relative path; because this tells
              rsync that it is OK to stash off a copy of a single file in a
              subdir in the destination hierarchy, rsync will use the
              partial-dir as a staging area to bring over the copied file,
              and then rename it into place from there. (Specifying a
              <b>--partial-dir </b>with an absolute path does not have this
              side-effect.)

       <b>-y, --fuzzy</b>
              This option tells rsync that it should look for a basis file
              for any destination file that is missing.  The current
              algorithm looks in the same directory as the destination file
              for either a file that has an identical size and
              modified-time, or a similarly-named file.  If found, rsync
              uses the fuzzy basis file to try to speed up the transfer.

              If the option is repeated, the fuzzy scan will also be done in
              any matching alternate destination directories that are
              specified via <b>--compare-dest</b>, <b>--copy-dest</b>, or <b>--link-dest</b>.

              Note that the use of the <b>--delete </b>option might get rid of any
              potential fuzzy-match files, so either use <b>--delete-after </b>or
              specify some filename exclusions if you need to prevent this.

       <b>--compare-dest=DIR</b>
              This option instructs rsync to use <i>DIR</i> on the destination
              machine as an additional hierarchy to compare destination
              files against doing transfers (if the files are missing in the
              destination directory).  If a file is found in <i>DIR</i> that is
              identical to the sender’s file, the file will NOT be
              transferred to the destination directory.  This is useful for
              creating a sparse backup of just files that have changed from
              an earlier backup.  This option is typically used to copy into
              an empty (or newly created) directory.

              Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <b>--compare-dest</b>
              directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search
              the list in the order specified for an exact match.  If a
              match is found that differs only in attributes, a local copy
              is made and the attributes updated.  If a match is not found,
              a basis file from one of the <i>DIR</i>s will be selected to try to
              speed up the transfer.

              If <i>DIR</i> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination
              directory.  See also <b>--copy-dest </b>and <b>--link-dest</b>.

              NOTE: beginning with version 3.1.0, rsync will remove a file
              from a non-empty destination hierarchy if an exact match is
              found in one of the compare-dest hierarchies (making the end
              result more closely match a fresh copy).

       <b>--copy-dest=DIR</b>
              This option behaves like <b>--compare-dest</b>, but rsync will also
              copy unchanged files found in <i>DIR</i> to the destination directory
              using a local copy.  This is useful for doing transfers to a
              new destination while leaving existing files intact, and then
              doing a flash-cutover when all files have been successfully
              transferred.

              Multiple <b>--copy-dest </b>directories may be provided, which will
              cause rsync to search the list in the order specified for an
              unchanged file.  If a match is not found, a basis file from
              one of the <i>DIR</i>s will be selected to try to speed up the
              transfer.

              If <i>DIR</i> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination
              directory.  See also <b>--compare-dest </b>and <b>--link-dest</b>.

       <b>--link-dest=DIR</b>
              This option behaves like <b>--copy-dest</b>, but unchanged files are
              hard linked from <i>DIR</i> to the destination directory.  The files
              must be identical in all preserved attributes (e.g.
              permissions, possibly ownership) in order for the files to be
              linked together.  An example:

                rsync -av --link-dest=$PWD/prior_dir host:src_dir/ new_dir/

              If file’s aren’t linking, double-check their attributes.  Also
              check if some attributes are getting forced outside of rsync’s
              control, such a mount option that squishes root to a single
              user, or mounts a removable drive with generic ownership (such
              as OS X’s "Ignore ownership on this volume" option).

              Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple <b>--link-dest </b>directories
              may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in
              the order specified for an exact match.  If a match is found
              that differs only in attributes, a local copy is made and the
              attributes updated.  If a match is not found, a basis file
              from one of the <i>DIR</i>s will be selected to try to speed up the
              transfer.

              This option works best when copying into an empty destination
              hierarchy, as existing files may get their attributes tweaked,
              and that can affect alternate destination files via
              hard-links.  Also, itemizing of changes can get a bit muddled.
              Note that prior to version 3.1.0, an alternate-directory exact
              match would never be found (nor linked into the destination)
              when a destination file already exists.

              Note that if you combine this option with <b>--ignore-times</b>,
              rsync will not link any files together because it only links
              identical files together as a substitute for transferring the
              file, never as an additional check after the file is updated.

              If <i>DIR</i> is a relative path, it is relative to the destination
              directory.  See also <b>--compare-dest </b>and <b>--copy-dest</b>.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 2.6.1 had a bug that could
              prevent <b>--link-dest </b>from working properly for a non-super-user
              when <b>-o </b>was specified (or implied by <b>-a</b>).  You can work-around
              this bug by avoiding the <b>-o </b>option when sending to an old
              rsync.

       <b>-z, --compress</b>
              With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent
              to the destination machine, which reduces the amount of data
              being transmitted -- something that is useful over a slow
              connection.

              Note that this option typically achieves better compression
              ratios than can be achieved by using a compressing remote
              shell or a compressing transport because it takes advantage of
              the implicit information in the matching data blocks that are
              not explicitly sent over the connection.  This matching-data
              compression comes at a cost of CPU, though, and can be
              disabled by repeating the <b>-z </b>option, but only if both sides
              are at least version 3.1.1.

              Note that if your version of rsync was compiled with an
              external zlib (instead of the zlib that comes packaged with
              rsync) then it will not support the old-style compression,
              only the new-style (repeated-option) compression.  In the
              future this new-style compression will likely become the
              default.

              The client rsync requests new-style compression on the server
              via the <b>--new-compress </b>option, so if you see that option
              rejected it means that the server is not new enough to support
              <b>-zz</b>.  Rsync also accepts the <b>--old-compress </b>option for a
              future time when new-style compression becomes the default.

              See the <b>--skip-compress </b>option for the default list of file
              suffixes that will not be compressed.

       <b>--compress-level=NUM</b>
              Explicitly set the compression level to use (see <b>--compress</b>)
              instead of letting it default.  If NUM is non-zero, the
              <b>--compress </b>option is implied.

       <b>--skip-compress=LIST</b>
              Override the list of file suffixes that will not be
              compressed.  The <b>LIST </b>should be one or more file suffixes
              (without the dot) separated by slashes (/).

              You may specify an empty string to indicate that no file
              should be skipped.

              Simple character-class matching is supported: each must
              consist of a list of letters inside the square brackets (e.g.
              no special classes, such as "[:alpha:]", are supported, and
              ’-’ has no special meaning).

              The characters asterisk (*) and question-mark (?) have no
              special meaning.

              Here’s an example that specifies 6 suffixes to skip (since 1
              of the 5 rules matches 2 suffixes):

                  --skip-compress=gz/jpg/mp[34]/7z/bz2

              The default list of suffixes that will not be compressed is
              this (in this version of rsync):

              <b>7z ace avi bz2 deb gpg gz iso jpeg jpg lz lzma lzo mov mp3 mp4</b>
              <b>ogg png rar rpm rzip tbz tgz tlz txz xz z zip</b>

              This list will be replaced by your <b>--skip-compress </b>list in all
              but one situation: a copy from a daemon rsync will add your
              skipped suffixes to its list of non-compressing files (and its
              list may be configured to a different default).

       <b>--numeric-ids</b>
              With this option rsync will transfer numeric group and user
              IDs rather than using user and group names and mapping them at
              both ends.

              By default rsync will use the username and groupname to
              determine what ownership to give files. The special uid 0 and
              the special group 0 are never mapped via user/group names even
              if the <b>--numeric-ids </b>option is not specified.

              If a user or group has no name on the source system or it has
              no match on the destination system, then the numeric ID from
              the source system is used instead.  See also the comments on
              the "use chroot" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage for
              information on how the chroot setting affects rsync’s ability
              to look up the names of the users and groups and what you can
              do about it.

       <b>--usermap=STRING, --groupmap=STRING</b>
              These options allow you to specify users and groups that
              should be mapped to other values by the receiving side.  The
              <b>STRING </b>is one or more <b>FROM</b>:<b>TO </b>pairs of values separated by
              commas.  Any matching <b>FROM </b>value from the sender is replaced
              with a <b>TO </b>value from the receiver.  You may specify usernames
              or user IDs for the <b>FROM </b>and <b>TO </b>values, and the <b>FROM </b>value may
              also be a wild-card string, which will be matched against the
              sender’s names (wild-cards do NOT match against ID numbers,
              though see below for why a ’*’ matches everything).  You may
              instead specify a range of ID numbers via an inclusive range:
              LOW-HIGH.  For example:

                --usermap=0-99:nobody,wayne:admin,*:normal --groupmap=usr:1,1:usr

              The first match in the list is the one that is used.  You
              should specify all your user mappings using a single <b>--usermap</b>
              option, and/or all your group mappings using a single
              <b>--groupmap </b>option.

              Note that the sender’s name for the 0 user and group are not
              transmitted to the receiver, so you should either match these
              values using a 0, or use the names in effect on the receiving
              side (typically "root").  All other <b>FROM </b>names match those in
              use on the sending side.  All <b>TO </b>names match those in use on
              the receiving side.

              Any IDs that do not have a name on the sending side are
              treated as having an empty name for the purpose of matching.
              This allows them to be matched via a "*" or using an empty
              name.  For instance:

                --usermap=:nobody --groupmap=*:nobody

              When the <b>--numeric-ids </b>option is used, the sender does not
              send any names, so all the IDs are treated as having an empty
              name.  This means that you will need to specify numeric <b>FROM</b>
              values if you want to map these nameless IDs to different
              values.

              For the <b>--usermap </b>option to have any effect, the <b>-o </b>(<b>--owner</b>)
              option must be used (or implied), and the receiver will need
              to be running as a super-user (see also the <b>--fake-super</b>
              option).  For the <b>--groupmap </b>option to have any effect, the <b>-g</b>
              (<b>--groups</b>) option must be used (or implied), and the receiver
              will need to have permissions to set that group.

       <b>--chown=USER:GROUP</b>
              This option forces all files to be owned by USER with group
              GROUP.  This is a simpler interface than using <b>--usermap </b>and
              <b>--groupmap </b>directly, but it is implemented using those options
              internally, so you cannot mix them.  If either the USER or
              GROUP is empty, no mapping for the omitted user/group will
              occur.  If GROUP is empty, the trailing colon may be omitted,
              but if USER is empty, a leading colon must be supplied.

              If you specify "--chown=foo:bar, this is exactly the same as
              specifying "--usermap=*:foo --groupmap=*:bar", only easier.

       <b>--timeout=TIMEOUT</b>
              This option allows you to set a maximum I/O timeout in
              seconds. If no data is transferred for the specified time then
              rsync will exit. The default is 0, which means no timeout.

       <b>--contimeout</b>
              This option allows you to set the amount of time that rsync
              will wait for its connection to an rsync daemon to succeed.
              If the timeout is reached, rsync exits with an error.

       <b>--address</b>
              By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when
              connecting to an rsync daemon.  The <b>--address </b>option allows
              you to specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.
              See also this option in the <b>--daemon </b>mode section.

       <b>--port=PORT</b>
              This specifies an alternate TCP port number to use rather than
              the default of 873.  This is only needed if you are using the
              double-colon (::) syntax to connect with an rsync daemon
              (since the URL syntax has a way to specify the port as a part
              of the URL).  See also this option in the <b>--daemon </b>mode
              section.

       <b>--sockopts</b>
              This option can provide endless fun for people who like to
              tune their systems to the utmost degree. You can set all sorts
              of socket options which may make transfers faster (or
              slower!). Read the man page for the setsockopt() system call
              for details on some of the options you may be able to set. By
              default no special socket options are set. This only affects
              direct socket connections to a remote rsync daemon.  This
              option also exists in the <b>--daemon </b>mode section.

       <b>--blocking-io</b>
              This tells rsync to use blocking I/O when launching a remote
              shell transport.  If the remote shell is either rsh or remsh,
              rsync defaults to using blocking I/O, otherwise it defaults to
              using non-blocking I/O.  (Note that ssh prefers non-blocking
              I/O.)

       <b>--outbuf=MODE</b>
              This sets the output buffering mode.  The mode can be None
              (aka Unbuffered), Line, or Block (aka Full).  You may specify
              as little as a single letter for the mode, and use upper or
              lower case.

              The main use of this option is to change Full buffering to
              Line buffering when rsync’s output is going to a file or pipe.

       <b>-i, --itemize-changes</b>
              Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being
              made to each file, including attribute changes.  This is
              exactly the same as specifying <b>--out-format='%i %n%L'</b>.  If you
              repeat the option, unchanged files will also be output, but
              only if the receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can
              use <b>-vv </b>with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on
              the output of other verbose messages).

              The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long.
              The general format is like the string <b>YXcstpoguax</b>, where <b>Y </b>is
              replaced by the type of update being done, <b>X </b>is replaced by
              the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that
              may be output if they are being modified.

              The update types that replace the <b>Y </b>are as follows:

              o      A <b>&lt; </b>means that a file is being transferred to the
                     remote host (sent).

              o      A <b>&gt; </b>means that a file is being transferred to the local
                     host (received).

              o      A <b>c </b>means that a local change/creation is occurring for
                     the item (such as the creation of a directory or the
                     changing of a symlink, etc.).

              o      A <b>h </b>means that the item is a hard link to another item
                     (requires <b>--hard-links</b>).

              o      A <b>. </b>means that the item is not being updated (though it
                     might have attributes that are being modified).

              o      A <b>* </b>means that the rest of the itemized-output area
                     contains a message (e.g. "deleting").

              The file-types that replace the <b>X </b>are: <b>f </b>for a file, a <b>d </b>for a
              directory, an <b>L </b>for a symlink, a <b>D </b>for a device, and a <b>S </b>for a
              special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).

              The other letters in the string above are the actual letters
              that will be output if the associated attribute for the item
              is being updated or a "." for no change.  Three exceptions to
              this are: (1) a newly created item replaces each letter with a
              "+", (2) an identical item replaces the dots with spaces, and
              (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this
              can happen when talking to an older rsync).

              The attribute that is associated with each letter is as
              follows:

              o      A <b>c </b>means either that a regular file has a different
                     checksum (requires <b>--checksum</b>) or that a symlink,
                     device, or special file has a changed value.  Note that
                     if you are sending files to an rsync prior to 3.0.1,
                     this change flag will be present only for
                     checksum-differing regular files.

              o      A <b>s </b>means the size of a regular file is different and
                     will be updated by the file transfer.

              o      A <b>t </b>means the modification time is different and is
                     being updated to the sender’s value (requires <b>--times</b>).
                     An alternate value of <b>T </b>means that the modification
                     time will be set to the transfer time, which happens
                     when a file/symlink/device is updated without <b>--times</b>
                     and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can’t
                     set its time.  (Note: when using an rsync 3.0.0 client,
                     you might see the <b>s </b>flag combined with <b>t </b>instead of the
                     proper <b>T </b>flag for this time-setting failure.)

              o      A <b>p </b>means the permissions are different and are being
                     updated to the sender’s value (requires <b>--perms</b>).

              o      An <b>o </b>means the owner is different and is being updated
                     to the sender’s value (requires <b>--owner </b>and super-user
                     privileges).

              o      A <b>g </b>means the group is different and is being updated
                     to the sender’s value (requires <b>--group </b>and the
                     authority to set the group).

              o      The <b>u </b>slot is reserved for future use.

              o      The <b>a </b>means that the ACL information changed.

              o      The <b>x </b>means that the extended attribute information
                     changed.

              One other output is possible:  when deleting files, the "%i"
              will output the string "*deleting" for each item that is being
              removed (assuming that you are talking to a recent enough
              rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting them as a
              verbose message).

       <b>--out-format=FORMAT</b>
              This allows you to specify exactly what the rsync client
              outputs to the user on a per-update basis.  The format is a
              text string containing embedded single-character escape
              sequences prefixed with a percent (%) character.   A default
              format of "%n%L" is assumed if either <b>--info=name </b>or <b>-v </b>is
              specified (this tells you just the name of the file and, if
              the item is a link, where it points).  For a full list of the
              possible escape characters, see the "log format" setting in
              the rsyncd.conf manpage.

              Specifying the <b>--out-format </b>option implies the <b>--info=name</b>
              option, which will mention each file, dir, etc. that gets
              updated in a significant way (a transferred file, a recreated
              symlink/device, or a touched directory).  In addition, if the
              itemize-changes escape (%i) is included in the string (e.g. if
              the <b>--itemize-changes </b>option was used), the logging of names
              increases to mention any item that is changed in any way (as
              long as the receiving side is at least 2.6.4).  See the
              <b>--itemize-changes </b>option for a description of the output of
              "%i".

              Rsync will output the out-format string prior to a file’s
              transfer unless one of the transfer-statistic escapes is
              requested, in which case the logging is done at the end of the
              file’s transfer.  When this late logging is in effect and
              <b>--progress </b>is also specified, rsync will also output the name
              of the file being transferred prior to its progress
              information (followed, of course, by the out-format output).

       <b>--log-file=FILE</b>
              This option causes rsync to log what it is doing to a file.
              This is similar to the logging that a daemon does, but can be
              requested for the client side and/or the server side of a
              non-daemon transfer.  If specified as a client option,
              transfer logging will be enabled with a default format of "%i
              %n%L".  See the <b>--log-file-format </b>option if you wish to
              override this.

              Here’s a example command that requests the remote side to log
              what is happening:

                rsync -av --remote-option=--log-file=/tmp/rlog src/ dest/

              This is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is
              closing unexpectedly.

       <b>--log-file-format=FORMAT</b>
              This allows you to specify exactly what per-update logging is
              put into the file specified by the <b>--log-file </b>option (which
              must also be specified for this option to have any effect).
              If you specify an empty string, updated files will not be
              mentioned in the log file.  For a list of the possible escape
              characters, see the "log format" setting in the rsyncd.conf
              manpage.

              The default FORMAT used if <b>--log-file </b>is specified and this
              option is not is ’%i %n%L’.

       <b>--stats</b>
              This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the
              file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective rsync’s
              delta-transfer algorithm is for your data.  This option is
              equivalent to <b>--info=stats2 </b>if combined with 0 or 1 <b>-v</b>
              options, or <b>--info=stats3 </b>if combined with 2 or more <b>-v</b>
              options.

              The current statistics are as follows:

              o      <b>Number of files </b>is the count of all "files" (in the
                     generic sense), which includes directories, symlinks,
                     etc.  The total count will be followed by a list of
                     counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).  For
                     example: "(reg: 5, dir: 3, link: 2, dev: 1, special:
                     1)" lists the totals for regular files, directories,
                     symlinks, devices, and special files.  If any of value
                     is 0, it is completely omitted from the list.

              o      <b>Number of created files </b>is the count of how many
                     "files" (generic sense) were created (as opposed to
                     updated).  The total count will be followed by a list
                     of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).

              o      <b>Number of deleted files </b>is the count of how many
                     "files" (generic sense) were created (as opposed to
                     updated).  The total count will be followed by a list
                     of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).  Note
                     that this line is only output if deletions are in
                     effect, and only if protocol 31 is being used (the
                     default for rsync 3.1.x).

              o      <b>Number of regular files transferred </b>is the count of
                     normal files that were updated via rsync’s
                     delta-transfer algorithm, which does not include dirs,
                     symlinks, etc.  Note that rsync 3.1.0 added the word
                     "regular" into this heading.

              o      <b>Total file size </b>is the total sum of all file sizes in
                     the transfer.  This does not count any size for
                     directories or special files, but does include the size
                     of symlinks.

              o      <b>Total transferred file size </b>is the total sum of all
                     files sizes for just the transferred files.

              o      <b>Literal data </b>is how much unmatched file-update data we
                     had to send to the receiver for it to recreate the
                     updated files.

              o      <b>Matched data </b>is how much data the receiver got locally
                     when recreating the updated files.

              o      <b>File list size </b>is how big the file-list data was when
                     the sender sent it to the receiver.  This is smaller
                     than the in-memory size for the file list due to some
                     compressing of duplicated data when rsync sends the
                     list.

              o      <b>File list generation time </b>is the number of seconds that
                     the sender spent creating the file list.  This requires
                     a modern rsync on the sending side for this to be
                     present.

              o      <b>File list transfer time </b>is the number of seconds that
                     the sender spent sending the file list to the receiver.

              o      <b>Total bytes sent </b>is the count of all the bytes that
                     rsync sent from the client side to the server side.

              o      <b>Total bytes received </b>is the count of all non-message
                     bytes that rsync received by the client side from the
                     server side.  "Non-message" bytes means that we don’t
                     count the bytes for a verbose message that the server
                     sent to us, which makes the stats more consistent.

       <b>-8, --8-bit-output</b>
              This tells rsync to leave all high-bit characters unescaped in
              the output instead of trying to test them to see if they’re
              valid in the current locale and escaping the invalid ones.
              All control characters (but never tabs) are always escaped,
              regardless of this option’s setting.

              The escape idiom that started in 2.6.7 is to output a literal
              backslash (\) and a hash (#), followed by exactly 3 octal
              digits.  For example, a newline would output as "\#012".  A
              literal backslash that is in a filename is not escaped unless
              it is followed by a hash and 3 digits (0-9).

       <b>-h, --human-readable</b>
              Output numbers in a more human-readable format.  There are 3
              possible levels:  (1) output numbers with a separator between
              each set of 3 digits (either a comma or a period, depending on
              if the decimal point is represented by a period or a comma);
              (2) output numbers in units of 1000 (with a character suffix
              for larger units -- see below); (3) output numbers in units of
              1024.

              The default is human-readable level 1.  Each <b>-h </b>option
              increases the level by one.  You can take the level down to 0
              (to output numbers as pure digits) by specifing the
              <b>--no-human-readable </b>(<b>--no-h</b>) option.

              The unit letters that are appended in levels 2 and 3 are: K
              (kilo), M (mega), G (giga), or T (tera).  For example, a
              1234567-byte file would output as 1.23M in level-2 (assuming
              that a period is your local decimal point).

              Backward compatibility note:  versions of rsync prior to 3.1.0
              do not support human-readable level 1, and they default to
              level 0.  Thus, specifying one or two <b>-h </b>options will behave
              in a comparable manner in old and new versions as long as you
              didn’t specify a <b>--no-h </b>option prior to one or more <b>-h</b>
              options.  See the <b>--list-only </b>option for one difference.

       <b>--partial</b>
              By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file
              if the transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances it is
              more desirable to keep partially transferred files. Using the
              <b>--partial </b>option tells rsync to keep the partial file which
              should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much
              faster.

       <b>--partial-dir=DIR</b>
              A better way to keep partial files than the <b>--partial </b>option
              is to specify a <i>DIR</i> that will be used to hold the partial data
              (instead of writing it out to the destination file).  On the
              next transfer, rsync will use a file found in this dir as data
              to speed up the resumption of the transfer and then delete it
              after it has served its purpose.

              Note that if <b>--whole-file </b>is specified (or implied), any
              partial-dir file that is found for a file that is being
              updated will simply be removed (since rsync is sending files
              without using rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm).

              Rsync will create the <i>DIR</i> if it is missing (just the last dir
              -- not the whole path).  This makes it easy to use a relative
              path (such as "<b>--partial-dir=.rsync-partial</b>") to have rsync
              create the partial-directory in the destination file’s
              directory when needed, and then remove it again when the
              partial file is deleted.

              If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will
              add an exclude rule at the end of all your existing excludes.
              This will prevent the sending of any partial-dir files that
              may exist on the sending side, and will also prevent the
              untimely deletion of partial-dir items on the receiving side.
              An example: the above <b>--partial-dir </b>option would add the
              equivalent of "<b>-f '-p .rsync-partial/'</b>" at the end of any
              other filter rules.

              If you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to
              add your own exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir
              because (1) the auto-added rule may be ineffective at the end
              of your other rules, or (2) you may wish to override rsync’s
              exclude choice.  For instance, if you want to make rsync
              clean-up any left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around,
              you should specify <b>--delete-after </b>and add a "risk" filter
              rule, e.g.  <b>-f 'R .rsync-partial/'</b>.  (Avoid using
              <b>--delete-before </b>or <b>--delete-during </b>unless you don’t need rsync
              to use any of the left-over partial-dir data during the
              current run.)

              IMPORTANT: the <b>--partial-dir </b>should not be writable by other
              users or it is a security risk.  E.g. AVOID "/tmp".

              You can also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR
              environment variable.  Setting this in the environment does
              not force <b>--partial </b>to be enabled, but rather it affects where
              partial files go when <b>--partial </b>is specified.  For instance,
              instead of using <b>--partial-dir=.rsync-tmp </b>along with
              <b>--progress</b>, you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp in your
              environment and then just use the <b>-P </b>option to turn on the use
              of the .rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers.  The only times
              that the <b>--partial </b>option does not look for this environment
              value are (1) when <b>--inplace </b>was specified (since <b>--inplace</b>
              conflicts with <b>--partial-dir</b>), and (2) when <b>--delay-updates</b>
              was specified (see below).

              For the purposes of the daemon-config’s "refuse options"
              setting, <b>--partial-dir </b>does <i>not</i> imply <b>--partial</b>.  This is so
              that a refusal of the <b>--partial </b>option can be used to disallow
              the overwriting of destination files with a partial transfer,
              while still allowing the safer idiom provided by
              <b>--partial-dir</b>.

       <b>--delay-updates</b>
              This option puts the temporary file from each updated file
              into a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at
              which time all the files are renamed into place in rapid
              succession.  This attempts to make the updating of the files a
              little more atomic.  By default the files are placed into a
              directory named ".~tmp~" in each file’s destination directory,
              but if you’ve specified the <b>--partial-dir </b>option, that
              directory will be used instead.  See the comments in the
              <b>--partial-dir </b>section for a discussion of how this ".~tmp~"
              dir will be excluded from the transfer, and what you can do if
              you want rsync to cleanup old ".~tmp~" dirs that might be
              lying around.  Conflicts with <b>--inplace </b>and <b>--append</b>.

              This option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit
              per file transferred) and also requires enough free disk space
              on the receiving side to hold an additional copy of all the
              updated files.  Note also that you should not use an absolute
              path to <b>--partial-dir </b>unless (1) there is no chance of any of
              the files in the transfer having the same name (since all the
              updated files will be put into a single directory if the path
              is absolute) and (2) there are no mount points in the
              hierarchy (since the delayed updates will fail if they can’t
              be renamed into place).

              See also the "atomic-rsync" perl script in the "support"
              subdir for an update algorithm that is even more atomic (it
              uses <b>--link-dest </b>and a parallel hierarchy of files).

       <b>-m, --prune-empty-dirs</b>
              This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty
              directories from the file-list, including nested directories
              that have no non-directory children.  This is useful for
              avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless directories when
              the sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of files
              using include/exclude/filter rules.

              Note that the use of transfer rules, such as the <b>--min-size</b>
              option, does not affect what goes into the file list, and thus
              does not leave directories empty, even if none of the files in
              a directory match the transfer rule.

              Because the file-list is actually being pruned, this option
              also affects what directories get deleted when a delete is
              active.  However, keep in mind that excluded files and
              directories can prevent existing items from being deleted due
              to an exclude both hiding source files and protecting
              destination files.  See the perishable filter-rule option for
              how to avoid this.

              You can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from
              the file-list by using a global "protect" filter.  For
              instance, this option would ensure that the directory
              "emptydir" was kept in the file-list:

              --filter ’protect emptydir/’

              Here’s an example that copies all .pdf files in a hierarchy,
              only creating the necessary destination directories to hold
              the .pdf files, and ensures that any superfluous files and
              directories in the destination are removed (note the hide
              filter of non-directories being used instead of an exclude):

              rsync -avm --del --include=’*.pdf’ -f ’hide,! */’ src/ dest

              If you didn’t want to remove superfluous destination files,
              the more time-honored options of "<b>--include='*/'</b>
              <b>--exclude='*'</b>" would work fine in place of the hide-filter (if
              that is more natural to you).

       <b>--progress</b>
              This option tells rsync to print information showing the
              progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user something to
              watch.  With a modern rsync this is the same as specifying
              <b>--info=flist2,name,progress</b>, but any user-supplied settings
              for those info flags takes precedence (e.g. "--info=flist0
              --progress").

              While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a
              progress line that looks like this:

                    782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04

              In this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes
              or 63% of the sender’s file, which is being reconstructed at a
              rate of 110.64 kilobytes per second, and the transfer will
              finish in 4 seconds if the current rate is maintained until
              the end.

              These statistics can be misleading if rsync’s delta-transfer
              algorithm is in use.  For example, if the sender’s file
              consists of the basis file followed by additional data, the
              reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the
              receiver gets to the literal data, and the transfer will
              probably take much longer to finish than the receiver
              estimated as it was finishing the matched part of the file.

              When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress
              line with a summary line that looks like this:

                    1,238,099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfr#5, to-chk=169/396)

              In this example, the file was 1,238,099 bytes long in total,
              the average rate of transfer for the whole file was 146.38
              kilobytes per second over the 8 seconds that it took to
              complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file during the
              current rsync session, and there are 169 more files for the
              receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not)
              remaining out of the 396 total files in the file-list.

              In an incremental recursion scan, rsync won’t know the total
              number of files in the file-list until it reaches the ends of
              the scan, but since it starts to transfer files during the
              scan, it will display a line with the text "ir-chk" (for
              incremental recursion check) instead of "to-chk" until the
              point that it knows the full size of the list, at which point
              it will switch to using "to-chk".  Thus, seeing "ir-chk" lets
              you know that the total count of files in the file list is
              still going to increase (and each time it does, the count of
              files left to check  will increase by the number of the files
              added to the list).

       <b>-P     </b>The <b>-P </b>option is equivalent to <b>--partial --progress</b>.  Its
              purpose is to make it much easier to specify these two options
              for a long transfer that may be interrupted.

              There is also a <b>--info=progress2 </b>option that outputs
              statistics based on the whole transfer, rather than individual
              files.  Use this flag without outputting a filename (e.g.
              avoid <b>-v </b>or specify <b>--info=name0</b>) if you want to see how the
              transfer is doing without scrolling the screen with a lot of
              names.  (You don’t need to specify the <b>--progress </b>option in
              order to use <b>--info=progress2</b>.)

       <b>--password-file=FILE</b>
              This option allows you to provide a password for accessing an
              rsync daemon via a file or via standard input if <b>FILE </b>is <b>-</b>.
              The file should contain just the password on the first line
              (all other lines are ignored).  Rsync will exit with an error
              if <b>FILE </b>is world readable or if a root-run rsync command finds
              a non-root-owned file.

              This option does not supply a password to a remote shell
              transport such as ssh; to learn how to do that, consult the
              remote shell’s documentation.  When accessing an rsync daemon
              using a remote shell as the transport, this option only comes
              into effect after the remote shell finishes its authentication
              (i.e. if you have also specified a password in the daemon’s
              config file).

       <b>--list-only</b>
              This option will cause the source files to be listed instead
              of transferred.  This option is inferred if there is a single
              source arg and no destination specified, so its main uses are:
              (1) to turn a copy command that includes a destination arg
              into a file-listing command, or (2) to be able to specify more
              than one source arg (note: be sure to include the
              destination).  Caution: keep in mind that a source arg with a
              wild-card is expanded by the shell into multiple args, so it
              is never safe to try to list such an arg without using this
              option.  For example:

                  rsync -av --list-only foo* dest/

              Starting with rsync 3.1.0, the sizes output by <b>--list-only </b>are
              affected by the <b>--human-readable </b>option.  By default they will
              contain digit separators, but higher levels of readability
              will output the sizes with unit suffixes.  Note also that the
              column width for the size output has increased from 11 to 14
              characters for all human-readable levels.  Use <b>--no-h </b>if you
              want just digits in the sizes, and the old column width of 11
              characters.

              Compatibility note:  when requesting a remote listing of files
              from an rsync that is version 2.6.3 or older, you may
              encounter an error if you ask for a non-recursive listing.
              This is because a file listing implies the <b>--dirs </b>option w/o
              <b>--recursive</b>, and older rsyncs don’t have that option.  To
              avoid this problem, either specify the <b>--no-dirs </b>option (if
              you don’t need to expand a directory’s content), or turn on
              recursion and exclude the content of subdirectories: <b>-r</b>
              <b>--exclude='/*/*'</b>.

       <b>--bwlimit=RATE</b>
              This option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate
              for the data sent over the socket, specified in units per
              second.  The RATE value can be suffixed with a string to
              indicate a size multiplier, and may be a fractional value
              (e.g.  "<b>--bwlimit=1.5m</b>").  If no suffix is specified, the
              value will be assumed to be in units of 1024 bytes (as if "K"
              or "KiB" had been appended).  See the <b>--max-size </b>option for a
              description of all the available suffixes. A value of zero
              specifies no limit.

              For backward-compatibility reasons, the rate limit will be
              rounded to the nearest KiB unit, so no rate smaller than 1024
              bytes per second is possible.

              Rsync writes data over the socket in blocks, and this option
              both limits the size of the blocks that rsync writes, and
              tries to keep the average transfer rate at the requested
              limit.  Some "burstiness" may be seen where rsync writes out a
              block of data and then sleeps to bring the average rate into
              compliance.

              Due to the internal buffering of data, the <b>--progress </b>option
              may not be an accurate reflection on how fast the data is
              being sent.  This is because some files can show up as being
              rapidly sent when the data is quickly buffered, while other
              can show up as very slow when the flushing of the output
              buffer occurs.  This may be fixed in a future version.

       <b>--write-batch=FILE</b>
              Record a file that can later be applied to another identical
              destination with <b>--read-batch</b>. See the "BATCH MODE" section
              for details, and also the <b>--only-write-batch </b>option.

       <b>--only-write-batch=FILE</b>
              Works like <b>--write-batch</b>, except that no updates are made on
              the destination system when creating the batch.  This lets you
              transport the changes to the destination system via some other
              means and then apply the changes via <b>--read-batch</b>.

              Note that you can feel free to write the batch directly to
              some portable media: if this media fills to capacity before
              the end of the transfer, you can just apply that partial
              transfer to the destination and repeat the whole process to
              get the rest of the changes (as long as you don’t mind a
              partially updated destination system while the multi-update
              cycle is happening).

              Also note that you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to
              a remote system because this allows the batched data to be
              diverted from the sender into the batch file without having to
              flow over the wire to the receiver (when pulling, the sender
              is remote, and thus can’t write the batch).

       <b>--read-batch=FILE</b>
              Apply all of the changes stored in FILE, a file previously
              generated by <b>--write-batch</b>.  If <i>FILE</i> is <b>-</b>, the batch data will
              be read from standard input.  See the "BATCH MODE" section for
              details.

       <b>--protocol=NUM</b>
              Force an older protocol version to be used.  This is useful
              for creating a batch file that is compatible with an older
              version of rsync.  For instance, if rsync 2.6.4 is being used
              with the <b>--write-batch </b>option, but rsync 2.6.3 is what will be
              used to run the <b>--read-batch </b>option, you should use
              "--protocol=28" when creating the batch file to force the
              older protocol version to be used in the batch file (assuming
              you can’t upgrade the rsync on the reading system).

       <b>--iconv=CONVERT_SPEC</b>
              Rsync can convert filenames between character sets using this
              option.  Using a CONVERT_SPEC of "." tells rsync to look up
              the default character-set via the locale setting.
              Alternately, you can fully specify what conversion to do by
              giving a local and a remote charset separated by a comma in
              the order <b>--iconv=LOCAL,REMOTE</b>, e.g.  <b>--iconv=utf8,iso88591</b>.
              This order ensures that the option will stay the same whether
              you’re pushing or pulling files.  Finally, you can specify
              either <b>--no-iconv </b>or a CONVERT_SPEC of "-" to turn off any
              conversion.  The default setting of this option is
              site-specific, and can also be affected via the RSYNC_ICONV
              environment variable.

              For a list of what charset names your local iconv library
              supports, you can run "iconv --list".

              If you specify the <b>--protect-args </b>option (<b>-s</b>), rsync will
              translate the filenames you specify on the command-line that
              are being sent to the remote host.  See also the <b>--files-from</b>
              option.

              Note that rsync does not do any conversion of names in filter
              files (including include/exclude files).  It is up to you to
              ensure that you’re specifying matching rules that can match on
              both sides of the transfer.  For instance, you can specify
              extra include/exclude rules if there are filename differences
              on the two sides that need to be accounted for.

              When you pass an <b>--iconv </b>option to an rsync daemon that allows
              it, the daemon uses the charset specified in its "charset"
              configuration parameter regardless of the remote charset you
              actually pass.  Thus, you may feel free to specify just the
              local charset for a daemon transfer (e.g. <b>--iconv=utf8</b>).

       <b>-4, --ipv4 </b>or <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
              Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating sockets.  This
              only affects sockets that rsync has direct control over, such
              as the outgoing socket when directly contacting an rsync
              daemon.  See also these options in the <b>--daemon </b>mode section.

              If rsync was complied without support for IPv6, the <b>--ipv6</b>
              option will have no effect.  The <b>--version </b>output will tell
              you if this is the case.

       <b>--checksum-seed=NUM</b>
              Set the checksum seed to the integer NUM.  This 4 byte
              checksum seed is included in each block and MD4 file checksum
              calculation (the more modern MD5 file checksums don’t use a
              seed).  By default the checksum seed is generated by the
              server and defaults to the current time() .  This option is
              used to set a specific checksum seed, which is useful for
              applications that want repeatable block checksums, or in the
              case where the user wants a more random checksum seed.
              Setting NUM to 0 causes rsync to use the default of time() for
              checksum seed.

<h2><a id="DAEMON_OPTIONS" href="#DAEMON_OPTIONS"></a>DAEMON OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The options allowed when starting an rsync daemon are as follows:

       <b>--daemon</b>
              This tells rsync that it is to run as a daemon.  The daemon
              you start running may be accessed using an rsync client using
              the <b>host::module </b>or <b>rsync://host/module/ </b>syntax.

              If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it
              is being run via inetd, otherwise it will detach from the
              current terminal and become a background daemon.  The daemon
              will read the config file (rsyncd.conf) on each connect made
              by a client and respond to requests accordingly.  See the
              <a href="../man5/rsyncd.conf.5.html">rsyncd.conf(5)</a> man page for more details.

       <b>--address</b>
              By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when run as
              a daemon with the <b>--daemon </b>option.  The <b>--address </b>option
              allows you to specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to
              bind to.  This makes virtual hosting possible in conjunction
              with the <b>--config </b>option.  See also the "address" global
              option in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

       <b>--bwlimit=RATE</b>
              This option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate
              for the data the daemon sends over the socket.  The client can
              still specify a smaller <b>--bwlimit </b>value, but no larger value
              will be allowed.  See the client version of this option
              (above) for some extra details.

       <b>--config=FILE</b>
              This specifies an alternate config file than the default.
              This is only relevant when <b>--daemon </b>is specified.  The default
              is /etc/rsyncd.conf unless the daemon is running over a remote
              shell program and the remote user is not the super-user; in
              that case the default is rsyncd.conf in the current directory
              (typically $HOME).

       <b>-M, --dparam=OVERRIDE</b>
              This option can be used to set a daemon-config parameter when
              starting up rsync in daemon mode.  It is equivalent to adding
              the parameter at the end of the global settings prior to the
              first module’s definition.  The parameter names can be
              specified without spaces, if you so desire.  For instance:

                  rsync --daemon -M pidfile=/path/rsync.pid

       <b>--no-detach</b>
              When running as a daemon, this option instructs rsync to not
              detach itself and become a background process.  This option is
              required when running as a service on Cygwin, and may also be
              useful when rsync is supervised by a program such as
              <b>daemontools </b>or AIX’s <b>System Resource Controller</b>.  <b>--no-detach</b>
              is also recommended when rsync is run under a debugger.  This
              option has no effect if rsync is run from inetd or sshd.

       <b>--port=PORT</b>
              This specifies an alternate TCP port number for the daemon to
              listen on rather than the default of 873.  See also the "port"
              global option in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

       <b>--log-file=FILE</b>
              This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given log-file
              name instead of using the "log file" setting in the config
              file.

       <b>--log-file-format=FORMAT</b>
              This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given FORMAT
              string instead of using the "log format" setting in the config
              file.  It also enables "transfer logging" unless the string is
              empty, in which case transfer logging is turned off.

       <b>--sockopts</b>
              This overrides the <b>socket options </b>setting in the rsyncd.conf
              file and has the same syntax.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              This option increases the amount of information the daemon
              logs during its startup phase.  After the client connects, the
              daemon’s verbosity level will be controlled by the options
              that the client used and the "max verbosity" setting in the
              module’s config section.

       <b>-4, --ipv4 </b>or <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
              Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating the incoming
              sockets that the rsync daemon will use to listen for
              connections.  One of these options may be required in older
              versions of Linux to work around an IPv6 bug in the kernel (if
              you see an "address already in use" error when nothing else is
              using the port, try specifying <b>--ipv6 </b>or <b>--ipv4 </b>when starting
              the daemon).

              If rsync was complied without support for IPv6, the <b>--ipv6</b>
              option will have no effect.  The <b>--version </b>output will tell
              you if this is the case.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              When specified after <b>--daemon</b>, print a short help page
              describing the options available for starting an rsync daemon.

<h2><a id="FILTER_RULES" href="#FILTER_RULES"></a>FILTER RULES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The filter rules allow for flexible selection of which files to
       transfer (include) and which files to skip (exclude).  The rules
       either directly specify include/exclude patterns or they specify a
       way to acquire more include/exclude patterns (e.g. to read them from
       a file).

       As the list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks
       each name to be transferred against the list of include/exclude
       patterns in turn, and the first matching pattern is acted on:  if it
       is an exclude pattern, then that file is skipped; if it is an include
       pattern then that filename is not skipped; if no matching pattern is
       found, then the filename is not skipped.

       Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the
       command-line.  Filter rules have the following syntax:

              RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]
              RULE,MODIFIERS [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]

       You have your choice of using either short or long RULE names, as
       described below.  If you use a short-named rule, the ’,’ separating
       the RULE from the MODIFIERS is optional.  The PATTERN or FILENAME
       that follows (when present) must come after either a single space or
       an underscore (_).  Here are the available rule prefixes:

              <b>exclude, - </b>specifies an exclude pattern.
              <b>include, + </b>specifies an include pattern.
              <b>merge, . </b>specifies a merge-file to read for more rules.
              <b>dir-merge, : </b>specifies a per-directory merge-file.
              <b>hide, H </b>specifies a pattern for hiding files from the
              transfer.
              <b>show, S </b>files that match the pattern are not hidden.
              <b>protect, P </b>specifies a pattern for protecting files from
              deletion.
              <b>risk, R </b>files that match the pattern are not protected.
              <b>clear, ! </b>clears the current include/exclude list (takes no
              arg)

       When rules are being read from a file, empty lines are ignored, as
       are comment lines that start with a "#".

       Note that the <b>--include</b>/<b>--exclude </b>command-line options do not allow
       the full range of rule parsing as described above -- they only allow
       the specification of include/exclude patterns plus a "!" token to
       clear the list (and the normal comment parsing when rules are read
       from a file).  If a pattern does not begin with "- " (dash, space) or
       "+ " (plus, space), then the rule will be interpreted as if "+ " (for
       an include option) or "- " (for an exclude option) were prefixed to
       the string.  A <b>--filter </b>option, on the other hand, must always
       contain either a short or long rule name at the start of the rule.

       Note also that the <b>--filter</b>, <b>--include</b>, and <b>--exclude </b>options take
       one rule/pattern each. To add multiple ones, you can repeat the
       options on the command-line, use the merge-file syntax of the
       <b>--filter </b>option, or the <b>--include-from</b>/<b>--exclude-from </b>options.

<h2><a id="INCLUDE/EXCLUDE_PATTERN_RULES" href="#INCLUDE/EXCLUDE_PATTERN_RULES"></a>INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       You can include and exclude files by specifying patterns using the
       "+", "-", etc. filter rules (as introduced in the FILTER RULES
       section above).  The include/exclude rules each specify a pattern
       that is matched against the names of the files that are going to be
       transferred.  These patterns can take several forms:

       o      if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a
              particular spot in the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is
              matched against the end of the pathname.  This is similar to a
              leading ^ in regular expressions.  Thus "/foo" would match a
              name of "foo" at either the "root of the transfer" (for a
              global rule) or in the merge-file’s directory (for a
              per-directory rule).  An unqualified "foo" would match a name
              of "foo" anywhere in the tree because the algorithm is applied
              recursively from the top down; it behaves as if each path
              component gets a turn at being the end of the filename.  Even
              the unanchored "sub/foo" would match at any point in the
              hierarchy where a "foo" was found within a directory named
              "sub".  See the section on ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS
              for a full discussion of how to specify a pattern that matches
              at the root of the transfer.

       o      if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a
              directory, not a regular file, symlink, or device.

       o      rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard
              matching by checking if the pattern contains one of these
              three wildcard characters: ’*’, ’?’, and ’[’ .

       o      a ’*’ matches any path component, but it stops at slashes.

       o      use ’**’ to match anything, including slashes.

       o      a ’?’ matches any character except a slash (/).

       o      a ’[’ introduces a character class, such as [a-z] or
              [[:alpha:]].

       o      in a wildcard pattern, a backslash can be used to escape a
              wildcard character, but it is matched literally when no
              wildcards are present.  This means that there is an extra
              level of backslash removal when a pattern contains wildcard
              characters compared to a pattern that has none.  e.g. if you
              add a wildcard to "foo\bar" (which matches the backslash) you
              would need to use "foo\\bar*" to avoid the "\b" becoming just
              "b".

       o      if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) or a
              "**", then it is matched against the full pathname, including
              any leading directories. If the pattern doesn’t contain a / or
              a "**", then it is matched only against the final component of
              the filename.  (Remember that the algorithm is applied
              recursively so "full filename" can actually be any portion of
              a path from the starting directory on down.)

       o      a trailing "dir_name/***" will match both the directory (as if
              "dir_name/" had been specified) and everything in the
              directory (as if "dir_name/**" had been specified).  This
              behavior was added in version 2.6.7.

       Note that, when using the <b>--recursive </b>(<b>-r</b>) option (which is implied
       by <b>-a</b>), every subcomponent of every path is visited from the top
       down, so include/exclude patterns get applied recursively to each
       subcomponent’s full name (e.g. to include "/foo/bar/baz" the
       subcomponents "/foo" and "/foo/bar" must not be excluded).  The
       exclude patterns actually short-circuit the directory traversal stage
       when rsync finds the files to send.  If a pattern excludes a
       particular parent directory, it can render a deeper include pattern
       ineffectual because rsync did not descend through that excluded
       section of the hierarchy.  This is particularly important when using
       a trailing ’*’ rule.  For instance, this won’t work:

              + /some/path/this-file-will-not-be-found
              + /file-is-included
              - *

       This fails because the parent directory "some" is excluded by the ’*’
       rule, so rsync never visits any of the files in the "some" or
       "some/path" directories.  One solution is to ask for all directories
       in the hierarchy to be included by using a single rule: "+ */" (put
       it somewhere before the "- *" rule), and perhaps use the
       <b>--prune-empty-dirs </b>option.  Another solution is to add specific
       include rules for all the parent dirs that need to be visited.  For
       instance, this set of rules works fine:

              + /some/
              + /some/path/
              + /some/path/this-file-is-found
              + /file-also-included
              - *

       Here are some examples of exclude/include matching:

       o      "- *.o" would exclude all names matching *.o

       o      "- /foo" would exclude a file (or directory) named foo in the
              transfer-root directory

       o      "- foo/" would exclude any directory named foo

       o      "- /foo/*/bar" would exclude any file named bar which is at
              two levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root
              directory

       o      "- /foo/**/bar" would exclude any file named bar two or more
              levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root
              directory

       o      The combination of "+ */", "+ *.c", and "- *" would include
              all directories and C source files but nothing else (see also
              the <b>--prune-empty-dirs </b>option)

       o      The combination of "+ foo/", "+ foo/bar.c", and "- *" would
              include only the foo directory and foo/bar.c (the foo
              directory must be explicitly included or it would be excluded
              by the "*")

       The following modifiers are accepted after a "+" or "-":

       o      A <b>/ </b>specifies that the include/exclude rule should be matched
              against the absolute pathname of the current item.  For
              example, "-/ /etc/passwd" would exclude the passwd file any
              time the transfer was sending files from the "/etc" directory,
              and "-/ subdir/foo" would always exclude "foo" when it is in a
              dir named "subdir", even if "foo" is at the root of the
              current transfer.

       o      A <b>! </b>specifies that the include/exclude should take effect if
              the pattern fails to match.  For instance, "-! */" would
              exclude all non-directories.

       o      A <b>C </b>is used to indicate that all the global CVS-exclude rules
              should be inserted as excludes in place of the "-C".  No arg
              should follow.

       o      An <b>s </b>is used to indicate that the rule applies to the sending
              side.  When a rule affects the sending side, it prevents files
              from being transferred.  The default is for a rule to affect
              both sides unless <b>--delete-excluded </b>was specified, in which
              case default rules become sender-side only.  See also the hide
              (H) and show (S) rules, which are an alternate way to specify
              sending-side includes/excludes.

       o      An <b>r </b>is used to indicate that the rule applies to the
              receiving side.  When a rule affects the receiving side, it
              prevents files from being deleted.  See the <b>s </b>modifier for
              more info.  See also the protect (P) and risk (R) rules, which
              are an alternate way to specify receiver-side
              includes/excludes.

       o      A <b>p </b>indicates that a rule is perishable, meaning that it is
              ignored in directories that are being deleted.  For instance,
              the <b>-C </b>option’s default rules that exclude things like "CVS"
              and "*.o" are marked as perishable, and will not prevent a
              directory that was removed on the source from being deleted on
              the destination.

<h2><a id="MERGE-FILE_FILTER_RULES" href="#MERGE-FILE_FILTER_RULES"></a>MERGE-FILE FILTER RULES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       You can merge whole files into your filter rules by specifying either
       a merge (.) or a dir-merge (:) filter rule (as introduced in the
       FILTER RULES section above).

       There are two kinds of merged files -- single-instance (’.’) and
       per-directory (’:’).  A single-instance merge file is read one time,
       and its rules are incorporated into the filter list in the place of
       the "." rule.  For per-directory merge files, rsync will scan every
       directory that it traverses for the named file, merging its contents
       when the file exists into the current list of inherited rules.  These
       per-directory rule files must be created on the sending side because
       it is the sending side that is being scanned for the available files
       to transfer.  These rule files may also need to be transferred to the
       receiving side if you want them to affect what files don’t get
       deleted (see PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE below).

       Some examples:

              merge /etc/rsync/default.rules
              . /etc/rsync/default.rules
              dir-merge .per-dir-filter
              dir-merge,n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes
              :n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes

       The following modifiers are accepted after a merge or dir-merge rule:

       o      A <b>- </b>specifies that the file should consist of only exclude
              patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file
              comments.

       o      A <b>+ </b>specifies that the file should consist of only include
              patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file
              comments.

       o      A <b>C </b>is a way to specify that the file should be read in a
              CVS-compatible manner.  This turns on ’n’, ’w’, and ’-’, but
              also allows the list-clearing token (!) to be specified.  If
              no filename is provided, ".cvsignore" is assumed.

       o      A <b>e </b>will exclude the merge-file name from the transfer; e.g.
              "dir-merge,e .rules" is like "dir-merge .rules" and "-
              .rules".

       o      An <b>n </b>specifies that the rules are not inherited by
              subdirectories.

       o      A <b>w </b>specifies that the rules are word-split on whitespace
              instead of the normal line-splitting.  This also turns off
              comments.  Note: the space that separates the prefix from the
              rule is treated specially, so "- foo + bar" is parsed as two
              rules (assuming that prefix-parsing wasn’t also disabled).

       o      You may also specify any of the modifiers for the "+" or "-"
              rules (above) in order to have the rules that are read in from
              the file default to having that modifier set (except for the <b>!</b>
              modifier, which would not be useful).  For instance, "merge,-/
              .excl" would treat the contents of .excl as absolute-path
              excludes, while "dir-merge,s .filt" and ":sC" would each make
              all their per-directory rules apply only on the sending side.
              If the merge rule specifies sides to affect (via the <b>s </b>or <b>r</b>
              modifier or both), then the rules in the file must not specify
              sides (via a modifier or a rule prefix such as <b>hide</b>).

       Per-directory rules are inherited in all subdirectories of the
       directory where the merge-file was found unless the ’n’ modifier was
       used.  Each subdirectory’s rules are prefixed to the inherited
       per-directory rules from its parents, which gives the newest rules a
       higher priority than the inherited rules.  The entire set of
       dir-merge rules are grouped together in the spot where the merge-file
       was specified, so it is possible to override dir-merge rules via a
       rule that got specified earlier in the list of global rules.  When
       the list-clearing rule ("!") is read from a per-directory file, it
       only clears the inherited rules for the current merge file.

       Another way to prevent a single rule from a dir-merge file from being
       inherited is to anchor it with a leading slash.  Anchored rules in a
       per-directory merge-file are relative to the merge-file’s directory,
       so a pattern "/foo" would only match the file "foo" in the directory
       where the dir-merge filter file was found.

       Here’s an example filter file which you’d specify via <b>--filter=".</b>
       <b>file":</b>

              merge /home/user/.global-filter
              - *.gz
              dir-merge .rules
              + *.[ch]
              - *.o

       This will merge the contents of the /home/user/.global-filter file at
       the start of the list and also turns the ".rules" filename into a
       per-directory filter file.  All rules read in prior to the start of
       the directory scan follow the global anchoring rules (i.e. a leading
       slash matches at the root of the transfer).

       If a per-directory merge-file is specified with a path that is a
       parent directory of the first transfer directory, rsync will scan all
       the parent dirs from that starting point to the transfer directory
       for the indicated per-directory file.  For instance, here is a common
       filter (see <b>-F</b>):

              --filter=': /.rsync-filter'

       That rule tells rsync to scan for the file .rsync-filter in all
       directories from the root down through the parent directory of the
       transfer prior to the start of the normal directory scan of the file
       in the directories that are sent as a part of the transfer.  (Note:
       for an rsync daemon, the root is always the same as the module’s
       "path".)

       Some examples of this pre-scanning for per-directory files:

              rsync -avF /src/path/ /dest/dir
              rsync -av --filter=': ../../.rsync-filter' /src/path/
              /dest/dir
              rsync -av --filter=': .rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir

       The first two commands above will look for ".rsync-filter" in "/" and
       "/src" before the normal scan begins looking for the file in
       "/src/path" and its subdirectories.  The last command avoids the
       parent-dir scan and only looks for the ".rsync-filter" files in each
       directory that is a part of the transfer.

       If you want to include the contents of a ".cvsignore" in your
       patterns, you should use the rule ":C", which creates a dir-merge of
       the .cvsignore file, but parsed in a CVS-compatible manner.  You can
       use this to affect where the <b>--cvs-exclude </b>(<b>-C</b>) option’s inclusion of
       the per-directory .cvsignore file gets placed into your rules by
       putting the ":C" wherever you like in your filter rules.  Without
       this, rsync would add the dir-merge rule for the .cvsignore file at
       the end of all your other rules (giving it a lower priority than your
       command-line rules).  For example:

              cat &lt;&lt;EOT | rsync -avC --filter='. -' a/ b
              + foo.o
              :C
              - *.old
              EOT
              rsync -avC --include=foo.o -f :C --exclude='*.old' a/ b

       Both of the above rsync commands are identical.  Each one will merge
       all the per-directory .cvsignore rules in the middle of the list
       rather than at the end.  This allows their dir-specific rules to
       supersede the rules that follow the :C instead of being subservient
       to all your rules.  To affect the other CVS exclude rules (i.e. the
       default list of exclusions, the contents of $HOME/.cvsignore, and the
       value of $CVSIGNORE) you should omit the <b>-C </b>command-line option and
       instead insert a "-C" rule into your filter rules; e.g.
       "<b>--filter=-C</b>".

       You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the "!"
       filter rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above).  The
       "current" list is either the global list of rules (if the rule is
       encountered while parsing the filter options) or a set of
       per-directory rules (which are inherited in their own sub-list, so a
       subdirectory can use this to clear out the parent’s rules).
</pre>
<h2><a id="ANCHORING_INCLUDE/EXCLUDE_PATTERNS" href="#ANCHORING_INCLUDE/EXCLUDE_PATTERNS"></a>ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at
       the "root of the transfer" (as opposed to per-directory patterns,
       which are anchored at the merge-file’s directory).  If you think of
       the transfer as a subtree of names that are being sent from sender to
       receiver, the transfer-root is where the tree starts to be duplicated
       in the destination directory.  This root governs where patterns that
       start with a / match.

       Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the
       trailing slash on a source path or changing your use of the
       <b>--relative </b>option affects the path you need to use in your matching
       (in addition to changing how much of the file tree is duplicated on
       the destination host).  The following examples demonstrate this.

       Let’s say that we want to match two source files, one with an
       absolute path of "/home/me/foo/bar", and one with a path of
       "/home/you/bar/baz".  Here is how the various command choices differ
       for a 2-source transfer:

              Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest
              +/- pattern: /me/foo/bar
              +/- pattern: /you/bar/baz
              Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz

              Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me/ /home/you/ /dest
              +/- pattern: /foo/bar               (note missing "me")
              +/- pattern: /bar/baz               (note missing "you")
              Target file: /dest/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/bar/baz

              Example cmd: rsync -a --relative /home/me/ /home/you /dest
              +/- pattern: /home/me/foo/bar       (note full path)
              +/- pattern: /home/you/bar/baz      (ditto)
              Target file: /dest/home/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/home/you/bar/baz

              Example cmd: cd /home; rsync -a --relative me/foo you/ /dest
              +/- pattern: /me/foo/bar      (starts at specified path)
              +/- pattern: /you/bar/baz     (ditto)
              Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz

       The easiest way to see what name you should filter is to just look at
       the output when using <b>--verbose </b>and put a / in front of the name (use
       the <b>--dry-run </b>option if you’re not yet ready to copy any files).

<h2><a id="PER-DIRECTORY_RULES_AND_DELETE" href="#PER-DIRECTORY_RULES_AND_DELETE"></a>PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Without a delete option, per-directory rules are only relevant on the
       sending side, so you can feel free to exclude the merge files
       themselves without affecting the transfer.  To make this easy, the
       ’e’ modifier adds this exclude for you, as seen in these two
       equivalent commands:

              rsync -av --filter=': .excl' --exclude=.excl host:src/dir
              /dest
              rsync -av --filter=':e .excl' host:src/dir /dest

       However, if you want to do a delete on the receiving side AND you
       want some files to be excluded from being deleted, you’ll need to be
       sure that the receiving side knows what files to exclude.  The
       easiest way is to include the per-directory merge files in the
       transfer and use <b>--delete-after</b>, because this ensures that the
       receiving side gets all the same exclude rules as the sending side
       before it tries to delete anything:

              rsync -avF --delete-after host:src/dir /dest

       However, if the merge files are not a part of the transfer, you’ll
       need to either specify some global exclude rules (i.e. specified on
       the command line), or you’ll need to maintain your own per-directory
       merge files on the receiving side.  An example of the first is this
       (assume that the remote .rules files exclude themselves):

       rsync -av --filter=’: .rules’ --filter=’. /my/extra.rules’
          --delete host:src/dir /dest

       In the above example the extra.rules file can affect both sides of
       the transfer, but (on the sending side) the rules are subservient to
       the rules merged from the .rules files because they were specified
       after the per-directory merge rule.

       In one final example, the remote side is excluding the .rsync-filter
       files from the transfer, but we want to use our own .rsync-filter
       files to control what gets deleted on the receiving side.  To do this
       we must specifically exclude the per-directory merge files (so that
       they don’t get deleted) and then put rules into the local files to
       control what else should not get deleted.  Like one of these
       commands:

           rsync -av --filter=':e /.rsync-filter' --delete \
               host:src/dir /dest
           rsync -avFF --delete host:src/dir /dest

<h2><a id="BATCH_MODE" href="#BATCH_MODE"></a>BATCH MODE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Batch mode can be used to apply the same set of updates to many
       identical systems. Suppose one has a tree which is replicated on a
       number of hosts.  Now suppose some changes have been made to this
       source tree and those changes need to be propagated to the other
       hosts. In order to do this using batch mode, rsync is run with the
       write-batch option to apply the changes made to the source tree to
       one of the destination trees.  The write-batch option causes the
       rsync client to store in a "batch file" all the information needed to
       repeat this operation against other, identical destination trees.

       Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file
       status, checksum, and data block generation more than once when
       updating multiple destination trees. Multicast transport protocols
       can be used to transfer the batch update files in parallel to many
       hosts at once, instead of sending the same data to every host
       individually.

       To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync
       with the read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch
       file, and the destination tree.  Rsync updates the destination tree
       using the information stored in the batch file.

       For your convenience, a script file is also created when the
       write-batch option is used:  it will be named the same as the batch
       file with ".sh" appended.  This script file contains a command-line
       suitable for updating a destination tree using the associated batch
       file. It can be executed using a Bourne (or Bourne-like) shell,
       optionally passing in an alternate destination tree pathname which is
       then used instead of the original destination path.  This is useful
       when the destination tree path on the current host differs from the
       one used to create the batch file.

       Examples:

              $ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ /adest/dir/
              $ scp foo* remote:
              $ ssh remote ./foo.sh /bdest/dir/

              $ rsync --write-batch=foo -a /source/dir/ /adest/dir/
              $ ssh remote rsync --read-batch=- -a /bdest/dir/ &lt;foo

       In these examples, rsync is used to update /adest/dir/ from
       /source/dir/ and the information to repeat this operation is stored
       in "foo" and "foo.sh".  The host "remote" is then updated with the
       batched data going into the directory /bdest/dir.  The differences
       between the two examples reveals some of the flexibility you have in
       how you deal with batches:

       o      The first example shows that the initial copy doesn’t have to
              be local -- you can push or pull data to/from a remote host
              using either the remote-shell syntax or rsync daemon syntax,
              as desired.

       o      The first example uses the created "foo.sh" file to get the
              right rsync options when running the read-batch command on the
              remote host.

       o      The second example reads the batch data via standard input so
              that the batch file doesn’t need to be copied to the remote
              machine first.  This example avoids the foo.sh script because
              it needed to use a modified <b>--read-batch </b>option, but you could
              edit the script file if you wished to make use of it (just be
              sure that no other option is trying to use standard input,
              such as the "<b>--exclude-from=-</b>" option).

       Caveats:

       The read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is
       updating to be identical to the destination tree that was used to
       create the batch update fileset.  When a difference between the
       destination trees is encountered the update might be discarded with a
       warning (if the file appears to be up-to-date already) or the
       file-update may be attempted and then, if the file fails to verify,
       the update discarded with an error.  This means that it should be
       safe to re-run a read-batch operation if the command got interrupted.
       If you wish to force the batched-update to always be attempted
       regardless of the file’s size and date, use the <b>-I </b>option (when
       reading the batch).  If an error occurs, the destination tree will
       probably be in a partially updated state. In that case, rsync can be
       used in its regular (non-batch) mode of operation to fix up the
       destination tree.

       The rsync version used on all destinations must be at least as new as
       the one used to generate the batch file.  Rsync will die with an
       error if the protocol version in the batch file is too new for the
       batch-reading rsync to handle.  See also the <b>--protocol </b>option for a
       way to have the creating rsync generate a batch file that an older
       rsync can understand.  (Note that batch files changed format in
       version 2.6.3, so mixing versions older than that with newer versions
       will not work.)

       When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain
       options to match the data in the batch file if you didn’t set them to
       the same as the batch-writing command.  Other options can (and
       should) be changed.  For instance <b>--write-batch </b>changes to
       <b>--read-batch</b>, <b>--files-from </b>is dropped, and the
       <b>--filter</b>/<b>--include</b>/<b>--exclude </b>options are not needed unless one of the
       <b>--delete </b>options is specified.

       The code that creates the BATCH.sh file transforms any
       filter/include/exclude options into a single list that is appended as
       a "here" document to the shell script file.  An advanced user can use
       this to modify the exclude list if a change in what gets deleted by
       <b>--delete </b>is desired.  A normal user can ignore this detail and just
       use the shell script as an easy way to run the appropriate
       <b>--read-batch </b>command for the batched data.

       The original batch mode in rsync was based on "rsync+", but the
       latest version uses a new implementation.

<h2><a id="SYMBOLIC_LINKS" href="#SYMBOLIC_LINKS"></a>SYMBOLIC LINKS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic
       link in the source directory.

       By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all.  A message
       "skipping non-regular" file is emitted for any symlinks that exist.

       If <b>--links </b>is specified, then symlinks are recreated with the same
       target on the destination.  Note that <b>--archive </b>implies <b>--links</b>.

       If <b>--copy-links </b>is specified, then symlinks are "collapsed" by
       copying their referent, rather than the symlink.

       Rsync can also distinguish "safe" and "unsafe" symbolic links.  An
       example where this might be used is a web site mirror that wishes to
       ensure that the rsync module that is copied does not include symbolic
       links to <b>/etc/passwd </b>in the public section of the site.  Using
       <b>--copy-unsafe-links </b>will cause any links to be copied as the file
       they point to on the destination.  Using <b>--safe-links </b>will cause
       unsafe links to be omitted altogether.  (Note that you must specify
       <b>--links </b>for <b>--safe-links </b>to have any effect.)

       Symbolic links are considered unsafe if they are absolute symlinks
       (start with <b>/</b>), empty, or if they contain enough ".." components to
       ascend from the directory being copied.

       Here’s a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted.  The
       list is in order of precedence, so if your combination of options
       isn’t mentioned, use the first line that is a complete subset of your
       options:

       <b>--copy-links</b>
              Turn all symlinks into normal files (leaving no symlinks for
              any other options to affect).

       <b>--links --copy-unsafe-links</b>
              Turn all unsafe symlinks into files and duplicate all safe
              symlinks.

       <b>--copy-unsafe-links</b>
              Turn all unsafe symlinks into files, noisily skip all safe
              symlinks.

       <b>--links --safe-links</b>
              Duplicate safe symlinks and skip unsafe ones.

       <b>--links</b>
              Duplicate all symlinks.

<h2><a id="DIAGNOSTICS" href="#DIAGNOSTICS"></a>DIAGNOSTICS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little
       cryptic. The one that seems to cause the most confusion is "protocol
       version mismatch -- is your shell clean?".

       This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote
       shell facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is
       using for its transport. The way to diagnose this problem is to run
       your remote shell like this:

              ssh remotehost /bin/true &gt; out.dat

       then look at out.dat. If everything is working correctly then out.dat
       should be a zero length file. If you are getting the above error from
       rsync then you will probably find that out.dat contains some text or
       data. Look at the contents and try to work out what is producing it.
       The most common cause is incorrectly configured shell startup scripts
       (such as .cshrc or .profile) that contain output statements for
       non-interactive logins.

       If you are having trouble debugging filter patterns, then try
       specifying the <b>-vv </b>option.  At this level of verbosity rsync will
       show why each individual file is included or excluded.

              The CVSIGNORE environment variable supplements any ignore
              patterns in .cvsignore files. See the <b>--cvs-exclude </b>option for
              more details.

       <b>RSYNC_ICONV</b>
              Specify a default <b>--iconv </b>setting using this environment

       <b>RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS</b>
              Specify a non-zero numeric value if you want the

              value to make sure that it is disabled by default. (First
              supported in 3.1.0.)

       <b>RSYNC_RSH</b>
              The RSYNC_RSH environment variable allows you to override the
              default shell used as the transport for rsync.  Command line
              options are permitted after the command name, just as in the
              <b>-e </b>option.

       <b>RSYNC_PROXY</b>
              The RSYNC_PROXY environment variable allows you to redirect
              your rsync client to use a web proxy when connecting to a
              rsync daemon. You should set RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port
              pair.

       <b>RSYNC_PASSWORD</b>
              Setting RSYNC_PASSWORD to the required password allows you to
              run authenticated rsync connections to an rsync daemon without
              user intervention. Note that this does not supply a password

       <b>USER </b>or <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The USER or LOGNAME environment variables are used to
              determine the default username sent to an rsync daemon.  If
              neither is set, the username defaults to "nobody".

       times are transferred as *nix time_t values

       When transferring to FAT filesystems rsync may re-sync unmodified
       files.  See the comments on the <b>--modify-window </b>option.

       file permissions, devices, etc. are transferred as native numerical
       values

       see also the comments on the <b>--delete </b>option

       The options <b>--server </b>and <b>--sender </b>are used internally by rsync, and
       should never be typed by a user under normal circumstances.  Some
       awareness of these options may be needed in certain scenarios, such
       as when setting up a login that can only run an rsync command.  For
       instance, the support directory of the rsync distribution has an
       example script named rrsync (for restricted rsync) that can be used
       with a restricted ssh login.
