       <b>inotifywatch </b>listens for filesystem events using Linux's <a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a>
       interface, then outputs a summary count of the events received on
       each file or directory.
</pre>

       <b>inotifywatch </b>will output a table on standard out with one column for
       each type of event and one row for each watched file or directory.
       The table will show the amount of times each event occurred for each
       watched file or directory.  Output can be sorted by a particular
       event using the <b>-a </b>or <b>-d </b>options.

       Some diagnostic information will be output on standard error.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Output some helpful usage information.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              Output some extra information on standard error during
              execution.

       <b>@&lt;file&gt;</b>
              When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the
              specified file from being watched.  The file must be specified
              with a relative or absolute path according to whether a
              relative or absolute path is given for watched directories.
              If a specific path is explicitly both included and excluded,
              it will always be watched.

              <b>Note: </b>If you need to watch a directory or file whose name
              starts with @, give the absolute path.

       <b>--fromfile &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename
              per line.  If filenames begin with @ they are excluded as
              described above.  If &lt;file&gt; is `-', filenames are read from
              standard input.  Use this option if you need to watch too many
              files to pass in as command line arguments.

       <b>-z, --zero</b>
              Output table rows and columns even if all elements are zero.
              By default, rows and columns are only output if they contain
              non-zero elements.  Using this option when watching for every
              event on a lot of files can result in a <i>lot</i> of output!

       <b>--exclude &lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Do not process any events whose filename matches the specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case sensitive.

       <b>--excludei &lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Do not process any events whose filename matches the specified
              POSIX extended regular expression, case insensitive.

       <b>-r, --recursive</b>
              Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as
              arguments.  Watches will be set up recursively to an unlimited
              depth.  Symbolic links are not traversed.  If new directories
              are created within watched directories they will automatically
              be watched.

              <b>Warning: </b>If you use this option while watching the root
              directory of a large tree, it may take quite a while until all
              inotify watches are established, and events will not be
              received in this time.  Also, since one inotify watch will be
              established per subdirectory, it is possible that the maximum
              amount of inotify watches per user will be reached.  The
              default maximum is 8192; it can be increased by writing to
              <b>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches</b>.

       <b>-t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Listen only for the specified amount of seconds.  If not
              specified, inotifywatch will gather statistics until receiving
              an interrupt signal by (for example) pressing CONTROL-C at the
              console.

       <b>-e &lt;event&gt;, --event &lt;event&gt;</b>
              Listen for specific event(s) only.  The events which can be
              listened for are listed in the <b>EVENTS </b>section.  This option
              can be specified more than once.  If omitted, all events are
              listened for.

       <b>-a &lt;event&gt;, --ascending &lt;event&gt;</b>
              Sort output ascending by event counts for the specified event.
              Sortable events include `total' and all the events listed in
              the <b>EVENTS </b>section except `move' and `close' (you must use
              `moved_to', `moved_from', `close_write' or `close_nowrite'
              instead).  The default is to sort descending by `total'.

       <b>-d &lt;event&gt;, --descending &lt;event&gt;</b>
              Sort output descending by event counts for the specified
              event.  Sortable events include `total' and all the events
              listed in the <b>EVENTS </b>section except `move' and `close' (you
              must use `moved_to', `moved_from', `close_write' or
              `close_nowrite' instead).  The default is to sort descending
              by `total'.

<h2><a id="EVENTS" href="#EVENTS"></a>EVENTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The following events are valid for use with the <b>-e </b>option:

       <b>access </b>A watched file or a file within a watched directory was read
              from.

       <b>modify </b>A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
              written to.

       <b>attrib </b>The metadata of a watched file or a file within a watched
              directory was modified.  This includes timestamps, file
              permissions, extended attributes etc.

       <b>close_write</b>
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
              closed, after being opened in writeable mode.  This does not
              necessarily imply the file was written to.

       <b>close_nowrite</b>
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
              closed, after being opened in read-only mode.

       <b>close  </b>A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
              closed, regardless of how it was opened.  Note that this is
              actually implemented simply by listening for both <b>close_write</b>
              and <b>close_nowrite, </b>hence all close events received will be
              output as one of these, not <b>CLOSE.</b>

       <b>open   </b>A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
              opened.

       <b>moved_to</b>
              A file or directory was moved into a watched directory.  This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the
              same directory.

       <b>moved_from</b>
              A file or directory was moved from a watched directory.  This
              event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the
              same directory.

       <b>move   </b>A file or directory was moved from or to a watched directory.
              Note that this is actually implemented simply by listening for
              both <b>moved_to </b>and <b>moved_from, </b>hence all close events received
              will be output as one or both of these, not <b>MOVE.</b>

       <b>move_self</b>
              A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the
              file or directory is no longer being watched.

       <b>create </b>A file or directory was created within a watched directory.

       <b>delete </b>A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.

       <b>delete_self</b>
              A watched file or directory was deleted.  After this event the
              file or directory is no longer being watched.  Note that this
              event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened
              for.

       <b>unmount</b>
              The filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides
              was unmounted.  After this event the file or directory is no
              longer being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if
              it is not explicitly being listened to.

<h2><a id="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code
       which can cause events to be missed if they occur in a directory
       immediately after that directory is created.  This is probably not
       fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
