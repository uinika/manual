       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and
       horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on the system,
       along with their full command lines, as well as viewing them as a
       process tree, selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at
       once.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
       entering their PIDs.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       <b>-d --delay=DELAY</b>
              Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds

       <b>-C --no-color --no-colour</b>
              Start htop in monochrome mode

       <b>-h --help</b>
              Display a help message and exit

       <b>-p --pid=PID,PID...</b>
              Show only the given PIDs

       <b>-s --sort-key COLUMN</b>
              Sort by this column (use --sort-key help for a column list)

       <b>-u --user=USERNAME</b>
              Show only the processes of a given user

       <b>-v --version</b>
              Output version information and exit

       The following commands are supported while in htop:

       <b>Up, Alt-k</b>
            Select (hightlight) the previous process in the process list.
            Scroll the list if necessary.

       <b>Down, Alt-j</b>
            Select (hightlight) the next process in the process list. Scroll
            the list if necessary.

       <b>Left, Alt-h</b>
            Scroll the process list left.

       <b>Right, Alt-l</b>
            Scroll the process list right.

       <b>PgUp, PgDn</b>
            Scroll the process list up or down one window.

       <b>Home </b>Scroll to the top of the process list and select the first
            process.

       <b>End  </b>Scroll to the bottom of the process list and select the last
            process.

       <b>Ctrl-A, ^</b>
            Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e.
            beginning of line).

       <b>Ctrl-E, $</b>
            Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).

       <b>Space</b>
            Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple
            processes, like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged
            processes, instead of the currently highlighted one.

       <b>U    </b>Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).

       <b>s    </b>Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing
            this key will attach it to the currently selected process,
            presenting a live update of system calls issued by the process.

       <b>l    </b>Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed,
            pressing this key will display the list of file descriptors
            opened by the process.

       <b>F1, h, ?</b>
            Go to the help screen

       <b>F2, S</b>
            Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters
            displayed at the top of the screen, set various display options,
            choose among color schemes, and select which columns are
            displayed, in which order.

       <b>F3, /</b>
            Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed
            processes. The currently selected (highlighted) command will
            update as you type. While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle
            through matching occurrences.

       <b>F4, \</b>
            Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command
            line and only processes whose names match will be shown. To
            cancel filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc.

       <b>F5, t</b>
            Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the
            relations between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch
            between tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a
            sort view will exit tree view.

       <b>F6   </b>On sorted view, select a field for sorting, also accessible
            through &lt; and &gt;.  The current sort field is indicated by a
            highlight in the header.  On tree view, expand or collapse the
            current subtree. A "+" indicator in the tree node indicates that
            it is collapsed.

       <b>F7, ]</b>
            Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice'
            value).  This can only be done by the superuser.

       <b>F8, [</b>
            Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)

       <b>F9, k</b>
            "Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to
            one or a group of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the
            signal to all tagged processes.  If none is tagged, sends to the
            currently selected process.

       <b>F10, q</b>
            Quit

       <b>I    </b>Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to
            decreasing, and vice-versa.

       <b>+, - </b>When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a
            subtree is collapsed a "+" sign shows to the left of the process
            name.

       <b>a (on multiprocessor machines)</b>
            Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.

       <b>u    </b>Show only processes owned by a specified user.

       <b>M    </b>Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).

       <b>P    </b>Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).

       <b>T    </b>Sort by time (top compatibility key).

       <b>F    </b>"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently
            selected process to move in the list, make the selection bar
            follow it. This is useful for monitoring a process: this way,
            you can keep a process always visible on screen. When a movement
            key is used, "follow" loses effect.

       <b>K    </b>Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to
            be displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>H    </b>Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently
            than ordinary processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems),
            this can hide threads from userspace processes in the process
            list. (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>p    </b>Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is
            a toggle key.)

       <b>Ctrl-L</b>
            Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.

       <b>Numbers</b>
            PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will
            be moved to it.

       The following columns can display data about each process. A value of
       '-' in all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your
       system, or currently unimplemented in htop. The names below are the

       <b>STIME (STIME+)</b>
            The system CPU time, which is the amount of time the kernel has
            spent executing system calls on behalf of the process, measured
            in clock ticks.

       <b>CUTIME (CUTIME+)</b>
            The children's user CPU time, which is the amount of time the

       <b>NICE (NI)</b>
            The nice value of a process, from 19 (low priority) to -20 (high
            priority). A high value means the process is being nice, letting

<h2><a id="CONFIG_FILE" href="#CONFIG_FILE"></a>CONFIG FILE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       By default htop reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path
       ~/.config/htop/htoprc -- the configuration file is overwritten by
       htop's in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-
       edited. If no user configuration exists htop tries to read the
       system-wide configuration from ${prefix}/etc/htoprc and as a last
       resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults.

       You may override the location of the configuration file using the
       $HTOPRC environment variable (so you can have multiple configurations
       for different machines that share the same home directory, for
       example).
</pre>
<h2><a id="MEMORY_SIZES" href="#MEMORY_SIZES"></a>MEMORY SIZES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Memory sizes in htop are displayed as they are in tools from the GNU
       Coreutils (when ran with the --human-readable option). This means
       that sizes are printed in powers of 1024. (e.g., 1023M = 1072693248
       Bytes)

       The decision to use this convention was made in order to conserve
       screen space and make memory size representations consistent
       throughout htop.
