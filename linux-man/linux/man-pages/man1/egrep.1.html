       <b>grep </b>searches for <i>PATTERN</i> in each <i>FILE</i>.  A <i>FILE</i> of “<b>-</b>” stands for
       standard input.  If no <i>FILE</i> is given, recursive searches examine the
       working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By
       default, <b>grep </b>prints the matching lines.

       In addition, the variant programs <b>egrep </b>and <b>fgrep </b>are the same as
       <b>grep -E </b>and <b>grep -F</b>, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,
       but are provided for backward compatibility.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
   <b>Generic Program Information</b>
       <b>--help </b>Output a usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Output the version number of <b>grep </b>and exit.

   <b>Matcher Selection</b>
       <b>-E</b>, <b>--extended-regexp</b>
              Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as an extended regular expression (ERE, see
              below).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fixed-strings</b>
              Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a list of fixed strings (instead of
              regular expressions), separated by newlines, any of which is
              to be matched.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--basic-regexp</b>
              Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a basic regular expression (BRE, see
              below).  This is the default.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--perl-regexp</b>
              Interpret the pattern as a Perl-compatible regular expression
              (PCRE).  This is experimental and <b>grep -P </b>may warn of
              unimplemented features.

   <b>Matching Control</b>
       <b>-e </b><i>PATTERN</i>, <b>--regexp=</b><i>PATTERN</i>
              Use <i>PATTERN</i> as the pattern.  If this option is used multiple
              times or is combined with the <b>-f </b>(<b>--file</b>) option, search for
              all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a
              pattern beginning with “-”.

       <b>-f </b><i>FILE</i>, <b>--file=</b><i>FILE</i>
              Obtain patterns from <i>FILE</i>, one per line.  If this option is
              used multiple times or is combined with the <b>-e </b>(<b>--regexp</b>)
              option, search for all patterns given.  The empty file
              contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
              Ignore case distinctions, so that characters that differ only
              in case match each other.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match</b>
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--word-regexp</b>
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole
              words.  The test is that the matching substring must either be
              at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word
              constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the
              end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
              character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits,
              and the underscore.  This option has no effect if <b>-x </b>is also
              specified.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--line-regexp</b>
              Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.
              For a regular expression pattern, this is like parenthesizing
              the pattern and then surrounding it with <b>^ </b>and <b>$</b>.

       <b>-y     </b>Obsolete synonym for <b>-i</b>.

   <b>General Output Control</b>
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
              lines for each input file.  With the <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match </b>option
              (see below), count non-matching lines.

       <b>--color</b>[<b>=</b><i>WHEN</i>], <b>--colour</b>[<b>=</b><i>WHEN</i>]
              Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines,
              context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with
              escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.
              The colors are defined by the environment variable
              <b>GREP_COLORS</b>.  The deprecated environment variable <b>GREP_COLOR</b>
              is still supported, but its setting does not have priority.
              <i>WHEN</i> is <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--files-without-match</b>
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input
              file from which no output would normally have been printed.
              The scanning will stop on the first match.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--files-with-matches</b>
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input
              file from which output would normally have been printed.  The
              scanning will stop on the first match.

       <b>-m </b><i>NUM</i>, <b>--max-count=</b><i>NUM</i>
              Stop reading a file after <i>NUM</i> matching lines.  If the input is
              standard input from a regular file, and <i>NUM</i> matching lines are
              output, <b>grep </b>ensures that the standard input is positioned to
              just after the last matching line before exiting, regardless
              of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a
              calling process to resume a search.  When <b>grep </b>stops after <i>NUM</i>
              matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.  When
              the <b>-c </b>or <b>--count </b>option is also used, <b>grep </b>does not output a
              count greater than <i>NUM</i>.  When the <b>-v </b>or <b>--invert-match </b>option
              is also used, <b>grep </b>stops after outputting <i>NUM</i> non-matching
              lines.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only-matching</b>
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line,
              with each such part on a separate output line.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit
              immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an
              error was detected.  Also see the <b>-s </b>or <b>--no-messages </b>option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-messages</b>
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

   <b>Output Line Prefix Control</b>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--byte-offset</b>
              Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before
              each line of output.  If <b>-o </b>(<b>--only-matching</b>) is specified,
              print the offset of the matching part itself.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--with-filename</b>
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when
              there is more than one file to search.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-filename</b>
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the
              default when there is only one file (or only standard input)
              to search.

       <b>--label=</b><i>LABEL</i>
              Display input actually coming from standard input as input
              coming from file <i>LABEL</i>.  This is especially useful when
              implementing tools like <b>zgrep</b>, e.g., <b>gzip -cd foo.gz | grep</b>
              <b>--label=foo -H something</b>.  See also the <b>-H </b>option.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--line-number</b>
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within
              its input file.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--initial-tab</b>
              Make sure that the first character of actual line content lies
              on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.
              This is useful with options that prefix their output to the
              actual content: <b>-H</b>,<b>-n</b>, and <b>-b</b>.  In order to improve the
              probability that lines from a single file will all start at
              the same column, this also causes the line number and byte
              offset (if present) to be printed in a minimum size field
              width.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unix-byte-offsets</b>
              Report Unix-style byte offsets.  This switch causes <b>grep </b>to
              report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
              file, i.e., with CR characters stripped off.  This will
              produce results identical to running <b>grep </b>on a Unix machine.
              This option has no effect unless <b>-b </b>option is also used; it
              has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--null</b>
              Output a zero byte (the ASCII <b>NUL </b>character) instead of the
              character that normally follows a file name.  For example,
              <b>grep -lZ </b>outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of
              the usual newline.  This option makes the output unambiguous,
              even in the presence of file names containing unusual
              characters like newlines.  This option can be used with
              commands like <b>find -print0</b>, <b>perl -0</b>, <b>sort -z</b>, and <b>xargs -0 </b>to
              process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline
              characters.

   <b>Context Line Control</b>
       <b>-A </b><i>NUM</i>, <b>--after-context=</b><i>NUM</i>
              Print <i>NUM</i> lines of trailing context after matching lines.
              Places a line containing a group separator (<b>--</b>) between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the <b>-o </b>or <b>--only-matching</b>
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       <b>-B </b><i>NUM</i>, <b>--before-context=</b><i>NUM</i>
              Print <i>NUM</i> lines of leading context before matching lines.
              Places a line containing a group separator (<b>--</b>) between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the <b>-o </b>or <b>--only-matching</b>
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       <b>-C </b><i>NUM</i>, <b>-</b><i>NUM</i>, <b>--context=</b><i>NUM</i>
              Print <i>NUM</i> lines of output context.  Places a line containing a
              group separator (<b>--</b>) between contiguous groups of matches.
              With the <b>-o </b>or <b>--only-matching </b>option, this has no effect and
              a warning is given.

   <b>File and Directory Selection</b>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--text</b>
              Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent
              to the <b>--binary-files=text </b>option.

       <b>--binary-files=</b><i>TYPE</i>
              If a file's data or metadata indicate that the file contains
              binary data, assume that the file is of type <i>TYPE</i>.  Non-text
              bytes indicate binary data; these are either output bytes that
              are improperly encoded for the current locale, or null input
              bytes when the <b>-z </b>option is not given.

              By default, <i>TYPE</i> is <b>binary</b>, and when <b>grep </b>discovers that a
              file is binary it suppresses any further output, and instead
              outputs either a one-line message saying that a binary file
              matches, or no message if there is no match.

              If <i>TYPE</i> is <b>without-match</b>, when <b>grep </b>discovers that a file is
              binary it assumes that the rest of the file does not match;
              this is equivalent to the <b>-I </b>option.

              If <i>TYPE</i> is <b>text</b>, <b>grep </b>processes a binary file as if it were
              text; this is equivalent to the <b>-a </b>option.

              When <i>type</i> is <b>binary</b>, <b>grep </b>may treat non-text bytes as line
              terminators even without the <b>-z </b>option.  This means choosing
              <b>binary </b>versus <b>text </b>can affect whether a pattern matches a
              file.  For example, when <i>type</i> is <b>binary </b>the pattern <b>q$ might</b>
              match <b>q </b>immediately followed by a null byte, even though this
              is not matched when <i>type</i> is <b>text</b>.  Conversely, when <i>type</i> is
              <b>binary </b>the pattern <b>. </b>(period) might not match a null byte.

              <i>Warning:</i> The <b>-a </b>option might output binary garbage, which can
              have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the
              terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.  On the
              other hand, when reading files whose text encodings are
              unknown, it can be helpful to use <b>-a </b>or to set <b>LC_ALL='C' </b>in
              the environment, in order to find more matches even if the
              matches are unsafe for direct display.

       <b>-D </b><i>ACTION</i>, <b>--devices=</b><i>ACTION</i>
              If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use <i>ACTION</i> to
              process it.  By default, <i>ACTION</i> is <b>read</b>, which means that
              devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If
              <i>ACTION</i> is <b>skip</b>, devices are silently skipped.

       <b>-d </b><i>ACTION</i>, <b>--directories=</b><i>ACTION</i>
              If an input file is a directory, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.  By
              default, <i>ACTION</i> is <b>read</b>, i.e., read directories just as if
              they were ordinary files.  If <i>ACTION</i> is <b>skip</b>, silently skip
              directories.  If <i>ACTION</i> is <b>recurse</b>, read all files under each
              directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they
              are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the <b>-r </b>option.

       <b>--exclude=</b><i>GLOB</i>
              Skip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches the
              pattern <i>GLOB</i>, using wildcard matching; a name suffix is either
              the whole name, or any suffix starting after a <b>/ </b>and before a
              +non-<b>/</b>.  When searching recursively, skip any subfile whose
              base name matches <i>GLOB</i>; the base name is the part after the
              last <b>/</b>.  A pattern can use <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and <b>[</b>...<b>]  </b>as wildcards, and
              <b>\ </b>to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.

       <b>--exclude-from=</b><i>FILE</i>
              Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs
              read from <i>FILE</i> (using wildcard matching as described under
              <b>--exclude</b>).

       <b>--exclude-dir=</b><i>GLOB</i>
              Skip any command-line directory with a name suffix that
              matches the pattern <i>GLOB</i>.  When searching recursively, skip
              any subdirectory whose base name matches <i>GLOB</i>.  Ignore any
              redundant trailing slashes in <i>GLOB</i>.

       <b>-I     </b>Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data;
              this is equivalent to the <b>--binary-files=without-match </b>option.

       <b>--include=</b><i>GLOB</i>
              Search only files whose base name matches <i>GLOB</i> (using wildcard
              matching as described under <b>--exclude</b>).

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following
              symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  Note
              that if no file operand is given, grep searches the working
              directory.  This is equivalent to the <b>-d recurse </b>option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--dereference-recursive</b>
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow all
              symbolic links, unlike <b>-r</b>.

   <b>Other Options</b>
       <b>--line-buffered</b>
              Use line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance
              penalty.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--binary</b>
              Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-
              Windows, <b>grep </b>guesses whether a file is text or binary as
              described for the <b>--binary-files </b>option.  If <b>grep </b>decides the
              file is a text file, it strips the CR characters from the
              original file contents (to make regular expressions with <b>^ </b>and
              <b>$ </b>work correctly).  Specifying <b>-U </b>overrules this guesswork,
              causing all files to be read and passed to the matching
              mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF
              pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some regular
              expressions to fail.  This option has no effect on platforms
              other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--null-data</b>
              Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each
              terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of
              a newline.  Like the <b>-Z </b>or <b>--null </b>option, this option can be
              used with commands like <b>sort -z </b>to process arbitrary file
              names.

<h2><a id="REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS"></a>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
       Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
       expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller
       expressions.

       <b>grep </b>understands three different versions of regular expression
       syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE) and “perl” (PCRE).  In GNU
       <b>grep </b>there is no difference in available functionality between basic
       and extended syntaxes.  In other implementations, basic regular
       expressions are less powerful.  The following description applies to
       extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular
       expressions are summarized afterwards.  Perl-compatible regular
       expressions give additional functionality, and are documented in
       pcresyntax(3) and pcrepattern(3), but work only if PCRE is available
       in the system.

       The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that
       match a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and
       digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-
       character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a
       backslash.

       The period <b>. </b>matches any single character.

   <b>Character Classes and Bracket Expressions</b>
       A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed by <b>[ </b>and <b>]</b>.  It
       matches any single character in that list; if the first character of
       the list is the caret <b>^ </b>then it matches any character <i>not</i> in the
       list.  For example, the regular expression <b>[0123456789] </b>matches any
       single digit.

       Within a bracket expression, a <i>range expression</i> consists of two
       characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any single character
       that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's
       collating sequence and character set.  For example, in the default C
       locale, <b>[a-d] </b>is equivalent to <b>[abcd]</b>.  Many locales sort characters
       in dictionary order, and in these locales <b>[a-d] </b>is typically not
       equivalent to <b>[abcd]</b>; it might be equivalent to <b>[aBbCcDd]</b>, for
       example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket
       expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the <b>LC_ALL</b>
       environment variable to the value <b>C</b>.

       Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within
       bracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self explanatory,
       and they are <b>[:alnum:]</b>, <b>[:alpha:]</b>, <b>[:cntrl:]</b>, <b>[:digit:]</b>, <b>[:graph:]</b>,
       <b>[:lower:]</b>, <b>[:print:]</b>, <b>[:punct:]</b>, <b>[:space:]</b>, <b>[:upper:]</b>, and
       <b>[:xdigit:].  </b>For example, <b>[[:alnum:]] </b>means the character class of
       numbers and letters in the current locale.  In the C locale and ASCII
       character set encoding, this is the same as <b>[0-9A-Za-z]</b>.  (Note that
       the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and
       must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket
       expression.)  Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside
       bracket expressions.  To include a literal <b>] </b>place it first in the
       list.  Similarly, to include a literal <b>^ </b>place it anywhere but first.
       Finally, to include a literal <b>- </b>place it last.

   <b>Anchoring</b>
       The caret <b>^ </b>and the dollar sign <b>$ </b>are meta-characters that
       respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
       line.

   <b>The Backslash Character and Special Expressions</b>
       The symbols <b>\&lt; </b>and <b>\&gt; </b>respectively match the empty string at the
       beginning and end of a word.  The symbol <b>\b </b>matches the empty string
       at the edge of a word, and <b>\B </b>matches the empty string provided it's
       <i>not</i> at the edge of a word.  The symbol <b>\w </b>is a synonym for
       <b>[_[:alnum:]] </b>and <b>\W </b>is a synonym for <b>[^_[:alnum:]]</b>.

   <b>Repetition</b>
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
       operators:
       <b>?      </b>The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       <b>*      </b>The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       <b>+      </b>The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       <b>{</b><i>n</i><b>}    </b>The preceding item is matched exactly <i>n</i> times.
       <b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,}   </b>The preceding item is matched <i>n</i> or more times.
       <b>{,</b><i>m</i><b>}   </b>The preceding item is matched at most <i>m</i> times.  This is a GNU
              extension.
       <b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>}  </b>The preceding item is matched at least <i>n</i> times, but not more
              than <i>m</i> times.

   <b>Concatenation</b>
       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
       expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
       that respectively match the concatenated expressions.

   <b>Alternation</b>
       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator <b>|</b>; the
       resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
       alternate expression.

   <b>Precedence</b>
       Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
       precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be enclosed in
       parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a
       subexpression.

   <b>Back References and Subexpressions</b>
       The back-reference <b>\</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a single digit, matches the
       substring previously matched by the <i>n</i>th parenthesized subexpression
       of the regular expression.

   <b>Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions</b>
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters <b>?</b>, <b>+</b>, <b>{</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b>
       lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions <b>\?</b>,
       <b>\+</b>, <b>\{</b>, <b>\|</b>, <b>\(</b>, and <b>\)</b>.

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The behavior of <b>grep </b>is affected by the following environment
       variables.

       The locale for category <b>LC_</b><i>foo</i> is specified by examining the three
       environment variables <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_</b><i>foo</i>, <b>LANG</b>, in that order.  The first
       of these variables that is set specifies the locale.  For example, if
       <b>LC_ALL </b>is not set, but <b>LC_MESSAGES </b>is set to <b>pt_BR</b>, then the
       Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the <b>LC_MESSAGES </b>category.
       The C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set,
       if the locale catalog is not installed, or if <b>grep </b>was not compiled
       with national language support (NLS).  The shell command <b>locale -a</b>
       lists locales that are currently available.

       <b>GREP_OPTIONS</b>
              This variable specifies default options to be placed in front
              of any explicit options.  As this causes problems when writing
              portable scripts, this feature will be removed in a future
              release of <b>grep</b>, and <b>grep </b>warns if it is used.  Please use an
              alias or script instead.

       <b>GREP_COLOR</b>
              This variable specifies the color used to highlight matched
              (non-empty) text.  It is deprecated in favor of <b>GREP_COLORS</b>,
              but still supported.  The <b>mt</b>, <b>ms</b>, and <b>mc </b>capabilities of
              <b>GREP_COLORS </b>have priority over it.  It can only specify the
              color used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any
              matching line (a selected line when the <b>-v </b>command-line option
              is omitted, or a context line when <b>-v </b>is specified).  The
              default is <b>01;31</b>, which means a bold red foreground text on
              the terminal's default background.

       <b>GREP_COLORS</b>
              Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight
              various parts of the output.  Its value is a colon-separated
              list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 </b>with the <b>rv</b>
              and <b>ne </b>boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).  Supported
              capabilities are as follows.

              <b>sl=    </b>SGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching
                     lines when the <b>-v </b>command-line option is omitted, or
                     non-matching lines when <b>-v </b>is specified).  If however
                     the boolean <b>rv </b>capability and the <b>-v </b>command-line
                     option are both specified, it applies to context
                     matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e.,
                     the terminal's default color pair).

              <b>cx=    </b>SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-
                     matching lines when the <b>-v </b>command-line option is
                     omitted, or matching lines when <b>-v </b>is specified).  If
                     however the boolean <b>rv </b>capability and the <b>-v </b>command-
                     line option are both specified, it applies to selected
                     non-matching lines instead.  The default is empty
                     (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              <b>rv     </b>Boolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of the
                     <b>sl= </b>and <b>cx= </b>capabilities when the <b>-v </b>command-line
                     option is specified.  The default is false (i.e., the
                     capability is omitted).

              <b>mt=01;31</b>
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any
                     matching line (i.e., a selected line when the <b>-v</b>
                     command-line option is omitted, or a context line when
                     <b>-v </b>is specified).  Setting this is equivalent to
                     setting both <b>ms= </b>and <b>mc= </b>at once to the same value.
                     The default is a bold red text foreground over the
                     current line background.

              <b>ms=01;31</b>
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a selected
                     line.  (This is only used when the <b>-v </b>command-line
                     option is omitted.)  The effect of the <b>sl= </b>(or <b>cx= </b>if
                     <b>rv</b>) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current
                     line background.

              <b>mc=01;31</b>
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a context
                     line.  (This is only used when the <b>-v </b>command-line
                     option is specified.)  The effect of the <b>cx= </b>(or <b>sl= </b>if
                     <b>rv</b>) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current
                     line background.

              <b>fn=35  </b>SGR substring for file names prefixing any content
                     line.  The default is a magenta text foreground over
                     the terminal's default background.

              <b>ln=32  </b>SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content
                     line.  The default is a green text foreground over the
                     terminal's default background.

              <b>bn=32  </b>SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content
                     line.  The default is a green text foreground over the
                     terminal's default background.

              <b>se=36  </b>SGR substring for separators that are inserted between
                     selected line fields (<b>:</b>), between context line fields,
                     (<b>-</b>), and between groups of adjacent lines when nonzero
                     context is specified (<b>--</b>).  The default is a cyan text
                     foreground over the terminal's default background.

              <b>ne     </b>Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line
                     using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (<b>\33[K</b>) each time a
                     colorized item ends.  This is needed on terminals on
                     which EL is not supported.  It is otherwise useful on
                     terminals for which the <b>back_color_erase </b>(<b>bce</b>) boolean
                     terminfo capability does not apply, when the chosen
                     highlight colors do not affect the background, or when
                     EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.  The default
                     is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no <b>=</b>...  part.  They are
              omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when
              specified.

              See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the
              documentation of the text terminal that is used for permitted
              values and their meaning as character attributes.  These
              substring values are integers in decimal representation and
              can be concatenated with semicolons.  <b>grep </b>takes care of
              assembling the result into a complete SGR sequence (<b>\33[</b>...<b>m</b>).
              Common values to concatenate include <b>1 </b>for bold, <b>4 </b>for
              underline, <b>5 </b>for blink, <b>7 </b>for inverse, <b>39 </b>for default
              foreground color, <b>30 </b>to <b>37 </b>for foreground colors, <b>90 </b>to <b>97 </b>for
              16-color mode foreground colors, <b>38;5;0 </b>to <b>38;5;255 </b>for
              88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, <b>49 </b>for default
              background color, <b>40 </b>to <b>47 </b>for background colors, <b>100 </b>to <b>107</b>
              for 16-color mode background colors, and <b>48;5;0 </b>to <b>48;5;255</b>
              for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

       <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_COLLATE</b>, <b>LANG</b>
              These variables specify the locale for the <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
              category, which determines the collating sequence used to
              interpret range expressions like <b>[a-z]</b>.

       <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b>, <b>LANG</b>
              These variables specify the locale for the <b>LC_CTYPE </b>category,
              which determines the type of characters, e.g., which
              characters are whitespace.  This category also determines the
              character encoding, that is, whether text is encoded in UTF-8,
              ASCII, or some other encoding.  In the C or POSIX locale, all
              characters are encoded as a single byte and every byte is a
              valid character.

       <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>, <b>LANG</b>
              These variables specify the locale for the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
              category, which determines the language that <b>grep </b>uses for
              messages.  The default C locale uses American English
              messages.

       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
              If set, <b>grep </b>behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, <b>grep</b>
              behaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX requires that
              options that follow file names must be treated as file names;
              by default, such options are permuted to the front of the
              operand list and are treated as options.  Also, POSIX requires
              that unrecognized options be diagnosed as “illegal”, but since
              they are not really against the law the default is to diagnose
              them as “invalid”.  <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>also disables
              <b>_</b><i>N</i><b>_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</b>, described below.

       <b>_</b><i>N</i><b>_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</b>
              (Here <i>N</i> is <b>grep</b>'s numeric process ID.)  If the <i>i</i>th character
              of this environment variable's value is <b>1</b>, do not consider the
              <i>i</i>th operand of <b>grep </b>to be an option, even if it appears to be
              one.  A shell can put this variable in the environment for
              each command it runs, specifying which operands are the
              results of file name wildcard expansion and therefore should
              not be treated as options.  This behavior is available only
              with the GNU C library, and only when <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>is not
              set.

       Large  repetition counts in the <b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>} </b>construct may cause <b>grep </b>to use
