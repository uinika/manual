       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>calculates shared library dependencies for executables
       named in its arguments. The dependencies are added to the
       substitution variables file <b>debian/substvars </b>as variable names
       <b>shlibs:</b><i>dependency-field</i> where <i>dependency-field</i> is a dependency field
       name. Any other variables starting with <b>shlibs: </b>are removed from the
       file.

       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>has two possible sources of information to generate
       dependency information. Either <i>symbols</i> files or <i>shlibs</i> files. For
       each binary that <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>analyzes, it finds out the list of
       libraries that it's linked with.  Then, for each library, it looks up
       either the <i>symbols</i> file, or the <i>shlibs</i> file (if the former doesn't
       exist or if debian/shlibs.local contains the relevant dependency).
       Both files are supposed to be provided by the library package and
       should thus be available as
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/<i>package</i>.<i>symbols</i> or
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/<i>package</i>.<i>shlibs</i>. The package name is
       identified in two steps: find the library file on the system (looking
       in the same directories that <b>ld.so </b>would use), then use <b>dpkg -S</b>
       <i>library-file</i> to lookup the package providing the library.

   <b>Symbols files</b>
       Symbols files contain finer-grained dependency information by
       providing the minimum dependency for each symbol that the library
       exports. The script tries to find a symbols file associated to a
       library package in the following places (first match is used):

       debian/*/DEBIAN/symbols
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>.  They are generated
              by <a href="dpkg-gensymbols.1.html">dpkg-gensymbols(1)</a>.  They are only used if the library is
              found in a package's build tree. The symbols file in that
              build tree takes precedence over symbols files from other
              binary packages.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i>

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/<i>package</i>.symbols
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
              <i>arch</i> is the architecture of the current system (obtained by
              <b>dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH</b>).

       Output from “<b>dpkg-query --control-path </b><i>package</i> symbols”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by <b>--admindir</b>, those files are located in
              /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.

       While scanning the symbols used by all binaries, <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>
       remembers the (biggest) minimal version needed for each library. At
       the end of the process, it is able to write out the minimal
       dependency for every library used (provided that the information of
       the <i>symbols</i> files are accurate).

       As a safe-guard measure, a symbols file can provide a
       <b>Build-Depends-Package </b>meta-information field and <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>will
       extract the minimal version required by the corresponding package in
       the <b>Build-Depends </b>field and use this version if it's higher than the
       minimal version computed by scanning symbols.

   <b>Shlibs files</b>
       Shlibs files associate directly a library to a dependency (without
       looking at the symbols). It's thus often stronger than really needed
       but very safe and easy to handle.

       The dependencies for a library are looked up in several places. The
       first file providing information for the library of interest is used:

       debian/shlibs.local
              Package-local overriding shared library dependency
              information.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.

       debian/*/DEBIAN/shlibs
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>.  They are only used
              if the library is found in a package's build tree. The shlibs
              file in that build tree takes precedence over shlibs files
              from other binary packages.

       Output from “<b>dpkg-query --control-path </b><i>package</i> shlibs”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by <b>--admindir</b>, those files are located in
              /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default
              Per-system default shared library dependency information.

       The extracted dependencies are then directly used (except if they are
       filtered out because they have been identified as duplicate, or as
       weaker than another dependency).
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>interprets non-option arguments as executable names,
       just as if they'd been supplied as <b>-e</b><i>executable</i>.

       <b>-e</b><i>executable</i>
              Include dependencies appropriate for the shared libraries
              required by <i>executable</i>.  This option can be used multiple
              times.

       <b>-l</b><i>directory</i>
              Prepend <i>directory</i> to the list of directories to search for
              private shared libraries (since dpkg 1.17.0). This option can
              be used multiple times.

              Note: Use this option instead of setting <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, as
              that environment variable is used to control the run-time
              linker and abusing it to set the shared library paths at
              build-time can be problematic when cross-compiling for
              example.

       <b>-d</b><i>dependency-field</i>
              Add dependencies to be added to the control file dependency
              field <i>dependency-field</i>.  (The dependencies for this field are
              placed in the variable <b>shlibs:</b><i>dependency-field</i>.)

              The <b>-d</b><i>dependency-field</i> option takes effect for all executables
              after the option, until the next <b>-d</b><i>dependency-field</i>.  The
              default <i>dependency-field</i> is <b>Depends</b>.

              If the same dependency entry (or set of alternatives) appears
              in more than one of the recognized dependency field names
              <b>Pre-Depends</b>, <b>Depends</b>, <b>Recommends</b>, <b>Enhances </b>or <b>Suggests </b>then
              <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>will automatically remove the dependency from
              all fields except the one representing the most important
              dependencies.

       <b>-p</b><i>varname-prefix</i>
              Start substitution variables with <i>varname-prefix</i><b>: </b>instead of
              <b>shlibs:</b>.  Likewise, any existing substitution variables
              starting with <i>varname-prefix</i><b>: </b>(rather than <b>shlibs:</b>) are
              removed from the substitution variables file.

       <b>-O</b>[<i>filename</i>]
              Print substitution variable settings to standard output (or
              <i>filename</i> if specified, since dpkg 1.17.2), rather than being
              added to the substitution variables file (<b>debian/substvars </b>by
              default).

       <b>-t</b><i>type</i> Prefer shared library dependency information tagged for the
              given package type. If no tagged information is available,
              falls back to untagged information. The default package type
              is <b>deb</b>. Shared library dependency information is tagged for a
              given type by prefixing it with the name of the type, a colon,
              and whitespace.

       <b>-L</b><i>local-shlibs-file</i>
              Read overriding shared library dependency information from
              <i>local-shlibs-file</i> instead of <b>debian/shlibs.local</b>.

       <b>-T</b><i>substvars-file</i>
              Write substitution variables in <i>substvars-file</i>; the default is
              <b>debian/substvars</b>.

       <b>-v     </b>Enable verbose mode (since dpkg 1.14.8).  Numerous messages
              are displayed to explain what <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>does.

       <b>-x</b><i>package</i>
              Exclude the package from the generated dependencies (since
              dpkg 1.14.8).  This is useful to avoid self-dependencies for
              packages which provide ELF binaries (executables or library
              plugins) using a library contained in the same package. This
              option can be used multiple times to exclude several packages.

       <b>-S</b><i>package-build-dir</i>
              Look into <i>package-build-dir</i> first when trying to find a
              library (since dpkg 1.14.15).  This is useful when the source
              package builds multiple flavors of the same library and you
              want to ensure that you get the dependency from a given binary
              package. You can use this option multiple times: directories
              will be tried in the same order before directories of other
              binary packages.

       <b>-I</b><i>package-build-dir</i>
              Ignore <i>package-build-dir</i> when looking for shlibs, symbols, and
              shared library files (since dpkg 1.18.5).  You can use this
              option multiple times.

       <b>--ignore-missing-info</b>
              Do not fail if dependency information can't be found for a
              shared library (since dpkg 1.14.8).  Usage of this option is
              discouraged, all libraries should provide dependency
              information (either with shlibs files, or with symbols files)
              even if they are not yet used by other packages.

       <b>--warnings=</b><i>value</i>
              <i>value</i> is a bit field defining the set of warnings that can be
              emitted by <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>(since dpkg 1.14.17).  Bit 0
              (value=1) enables the warning “symbol <i>sym</i> used by <i>binary</i> found
              in none of the libraries”, bit 1 (value=2) enables the warning
              “package could avoid a useless dependency” and bit 2 (value=4)
              enables the warning “<i>binary</i> should not be linked against
              <i>library</i>”.  The default <i>value</i> is 3: the first two warnings are
              active by default, the last one is not. Set <i>value</i> to 7 if you
              want all warnings to be active.

       <b>--admindir=</b><i>dir</i>
              Change the location of the <b>dpkg </b>database (since dpkg 1.14.0).
              The default location is <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the version and exit.

   <b>Warnings</b>
       Since <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>analyzes the set of symbols used by each binary
       of the generated package, it is able to emit warnings in several
       cases. They inform you of things that can be improved in the package.
       In most cases, those improvements concern the upstream sources
       directly. By order of decreasing importance, here are the various
       warnings that you can encounter:

       <b>symbol </b><i>sym</i> <b>used by </b><i>binary</i> <b>found in none of the libraries.</b>
              The indicated symbol has not been found in the libraries
              linked with the binary. The <i>binary</i> is most likely a library
              and it needs to be linked with an additional library during
              the build process (option <b>-l</b><i>library</i> of the linker).

       <i>binary</i> <b>contains an unresolvable reference to symbol </b><i>sym</i><b>: it's</b>
       <b>probably a plugin</b>
              The indicated symbol has not been found in the libraries
              linked with the binary. The <i>binary</i> is most likely a plugin and
              the symbol is probably provided by the program that loads this
              plugin. In theory a plugin doesn't have any SONAME but this
              binary does have one and as such it could not be clearly
              identified as such. However the fact that the binary is stored
              in a non-public directory is a strong indication that's it's
              not a normal shared library. If the binary is really a plugin,
              then disregard this warning. But there's always the
              possibility that it's a real library and that programs linking
              to it are using an RPATH so that the dynamic loader finds it.
              In that case, the library is broken and needs to be fixed.

       <b>package could avoid a useless dependency if </b><i>binary</i> <b>was not linked</b>
       <b>against </b><i>library</i> <b>(it uses none of the library's symbols)</b>
              None of the <i>binaries</i> that are linked with <i>library</i> use any of
              the symbols provided by the library. By fixing all the
              binaries, you would avoid the dependency associated to this
              library (unless the same dependency is also generated by
              another library that is really used).

       <b>package could avoid a useless dependency if </b><i>binaries</i> <b>were not linked</b>
       <b>against </b><i>library</i> <b>(they use none of the library's symbols)</b>
              Exactly the same as the above warning, but for multiple
              binaries.

       <i>binary</i> <b>should not be linked against </b><i>library</i> <b>(it uses none of the</b>
       <b>library's symbols)</b>
              The <i>binary</i> is linked to a library that it doesn't need. It's
              not a problem but some small performance improvements in
              binary load time can be obtained by not linking this library
              to this binary. This warning checks the same information as
              the previous one but does it for each binary instead of doing
              the check globally on all binaries analyzed.

   <b>Errors</b>
       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>will fail if it can't find a public library used by a
       binary or if this library has no associated dependency information
       (either shlibs file or symbols file). A public library has a SONAME
       and is versioned (libsomething.so.<i>X</i>). A private library (like a
       plugin) should not have a SONAME and doesn't need to be versioned.

       <b>couldn't find library </b><i>library-soname</i> <b>needed by </b><i>binary</i> <b>(its RPATH is</b>
       <b>'</b><i>rpath</i><b>')</b>
              The <i>binary</i> uses a library called <i>library-soname</i> but
              <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>has been unable to find the library.
              <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>creates a list of directories to check as
              following: directories listed in the RPATH of the binary,
              directories added by the <b>-l </b>option, directories listed in the
              <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH </b>environment variable, cross multiarch
              directories (ex. /lib/arm64-linux-gnu, /usr/lib/arm64-linux-
              gnu), standard public directories (/lib, /usr/lib),
              directories listed in /etc/ld.so.conf, and obsolete multilib
              directories (/lib32, /usr/lib32, /lib64, /usr/lib64).  Then it
              checks those directories in the package's build tree of the
              binary being analyzed, in the packages' build trees indicated
              with the <b>-S </b>command-line option, in other packages' build
              trees that contains a DEBIAN/shlibs or DEBIAN/symbols file and
              finally in the root directory.  If the library is not found in
              any of those directories, then you get this error.

              If the library not found is in a private directory of the same
              package, then you want to add the directory with <b>-l</b>. If it's
              in another binary package being built, you want to make sure
              that the shlibs/symbols file of this package is already
              created and that <b>-l </b>contains the appropriate directory if it
              also is in a private directory.

       <b>no dependency information found for </b><i>library-file</i> <b>(used by </b><i>binary</i><b>).</b>
              The library needed by <i>binary</i> has been found by <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>
              in <i>library-file</i> but <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>has been unable to find any
              dependency information for that library. To find out the
              dependency, it has tried to map the library to a Debian
              package with the help of <b>dpkg -S </b><i>library-file</i>.  Then it
              checked the corresponding shlibs and symbols files in
              /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/, and in the various package's
              build trees (debian/*/DEBIAN/).

              This failure can be caused by a bad or missing shlibs or
              symbols file in the package of the library. It might also
              happen if the library is built within the same source package
              and if the shlibs files has not yet been created (in which
              case you must fix debian/rules to create the shlibs before
              calling <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>). Bad RPATH can also lead to the
              library being found under a non-canonical name (example:
              /usr/lib/openoffice.org/../lib/libssl.so.0.9.8 instead of
              /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8) that's not associated to any
              package, <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>tries to work around this by trying to
              fallback on a canonical name (using <a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath(3)</a>) but it might
              not always work. It's always best to clean up the RPATH of the
              binary to avoid problems.

              Calling <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>in verbose mode (<b>-v</b>) will provide much
              more information about where it tried to find the dependency
              information. This might be useful if you don't understand why
              it's giving you this error.
