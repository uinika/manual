       This manual page describes the GNU version of <b>tbl</b>, which is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  <b>tbl </b>compiles descriptions of
       tables embedded within <b>troff </b>input files into commands that are
       understood by <b>troff</b>.  Normally, it should be invoked using the <b>-t</b>
       option of <b>groff.  </b>It is highly compatible with Unix <b>tbl</b>.  The output
       generated by GNU <b>tbl </b>cannot be processed with Unix <b>troff</b>; it must be
       processed with GNU <b>troff</b>.  If no files are given on the command line
       or a filename of <b>- </b>is given, the standard input is read.

       <b>-C     </b>Enable compatibility mode to recognize <b>.TS </b>and <b>.TE </b>even when
              followed by a character other than space or newline.  Leader
              characters (\a) are handled as interpreted.

       <b>-v     </b>Print the version number.

<h2><a id="LANGUAGE_OVERVIEW" href="#LANGUAGE_OVERVIEW"></a>LANGUAGE OVERVIEW  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>tbl </b>expects to find table descriptions wrapped in the <b>.TS </b>(table
       start) and <b>.TE </b>(table end) macros.  Within each such table sections,
       another table can be defined by using the request <b>.T&amp; </b>before the
       final command <b>.TE</b>.  Each table definition has the following
       structure:

       <i>Global options</i>
              This is optional.  This table part can use several of these
              options distributed in 1 or more lines.  The <i>global option</i>
              <i>part</i> must always be finished by a <b>semi-colon ; .</b>

       <i>Table format specification</i>
              This part must be given, it is not optional.  It determines
              the number of columns (cells) of the table.  Moreover each
              cell is classified by being central, left adjusted, or
              numerical, etc.  This specification can have several lines,
              but must be finished by a <b>dot .  </b>at the end of the last line.
              After each cell definition, <i>column specifiers</i> can be appended,
              but that's optional.

       Cells are separated by a tab character by default.  That can be
       changed by the <i>global option</i> <b>tbl(</b><i>c</i><b>)</b>, where <i>c</i> is an arbitrary
       character.
</pre>
<h2><a id="SIMPLE_EXAMPLES" href="#SIMPLE_EXAMPLES"></a>SIMPLE EXAMPLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The easiest table definition is.
              .TS
              c c c .
              This is   centered
              Well,     this also
              .TE
       By using <b>c c c</b>, each cell in the whole table will be centered.  The
       separating character is here the default <i>tab</i>.

       The result is

              This     is    centered

              Well,   this     also

       This definition is identical to
              .TS
              tab(@);
              ccc.
              This@is@centered
              Well,@this@also
              .TE
       Here, the separating tab character is changed to the letter <b>@</b>.

       Moreover a title can be added and the centering directions can be
       changed to many other formats:
              .TS
              tab(@);
              c s s
              l c n .
              Title
              left@centers@123
              another@number@75
              .TE
       The result is

                       Title
              left      centers   123
              another   number     75
       Here <b>l </b>means <i>left-justified</i>, and <b>n </b>means <i>numerical</i>, which is here
       <i>right-justified</i>.

   <b>Global options</b>
       The line immediately following the <b>.TS </b>macro may contain any of the
       following global options (ignoring the case of characters – Unix tbl
       only accepts options with all characters lowercase or all characters
       uppercase), separated by spaces, tabs, or commas:

       <b>allbox </b>Enclose each item of the table in a box.

       <b>box    </b>Enclose the table in a box.

       <b>center </b>Center the table (default is left-justified).  The alternative
              keyword name <b>centre </b>is also recognized (this is a GNU tbl
              extension).

       <b>decimalpoint(</b><i>c</i><b>)</b>
              Set the character to be recognized as the decimal point in
              numeric columns (GNU tbl only).

       <b>delim(</b><i>xy</i><b>)</b>
              Use <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> as start and end delimiters for <a href="eqn.1.html">eqn(1)</a>.

       <b>doublebox</b>
              Enclose the table in a double box.

       <b>doubleframe</b>
              Same as doublebox (GNU tbl only).

       <b>expand </b>Make the table as wide as the current line length (providing a
              column separation factor).  Ignored if one or more ‘x’ column
              specifiers are used (see below).

              In case the sum of the column widths is larger than the
              current line length, the column separation factor is set to
              zero; such tables extend into the right margin, and there is
              no column separation at all.

       <b>frame  </b>Same as box (GNU tbl only).

       <b>linesize(</b><i>n</i><b>)</b>
              Set lines or rules (e.g. from <b>box</b>) in <i>n</i>-point type.

       <b>nokeep </b>Don't use diversions to prevent page breaks (GNU tbl only).
              Normally <b>tbl </b>attempts to prevent undesirable breaks in boxed
              tables by using diversions.  This can sometimes interact badly
              with macro packages own use of diversions, when footnotes, for
              example, are used.

       <b>nospaces</b>
              Ignore leading and trailing spaces in data items (GNU tbl
              only).

       <b>nowarn </b>Turn off warnings related to tables exceeding the current line
              width (GNU tbl only).

       <b>tab(</b><i>x</i><b>) </b>Use the character <i>x</i> instead of a tab to separate items in a
              line of input data.

       The global options must end with a semicolon.  There might be
       whitespace between an option and its argument in parentheses.

   <b>Table format specification</b>
       After global options come lines describing the format of each line of
       the table.  Each such format line describes one line of the table
       itself, except that the last format line (which you must end with a
       period) describes all remaining lines of the table.  A single-key
       character describes each column of each line of the table.  Key
       characters can be separated by spaces or tabs.  You may run format
       specifications for multiple lines together on the same line by
       separating them with commas.

       You may follow each key character with specifiers that determine the
       font and point size of the corresponding item, that determine column
       width, inter-column spacing, etc.

       The longest format line defines the number of columns in the table;
       missing format descriptors at the end of format lines are assumed to
       be <b>L</b>.  Extra columns in the data (which have no corresponding format
       entry) are ignored.

       The available key characters are:

       <b>a</b>,<b>A    </b>Center longest line in this column and then left-justifies all
              other lines in this column with respect to that centered line.
              The idea is to use such alphabetic subcolumns (hence the name
              of the key character) in combination with <b>L</b>; they are called
              subcolumns because <b>A </b>items are indented by 1n relative to
              <b>L </b>entries.  Example:

                     .TS
                     tab(;);
                     ln,an.
                     item one;1
                     subitem two;2
                     subitem three;3
                     .T&amp;
                     ln,an.
                     item eleven;11
                     subitem twentytwo;22
                     subitem thirtythree;33
                     .TE

              Result:

                     item one                 1
                      subitem two             2
                      subitem three           3
                     item eleven             11
                      subitem twentytwo      22
                      subitem thirtythree    33

       <b>c</b>,<b>C    </b>Center item within the column.

       <b>l</b>,<b>L    </b>Left-justify item within the column.

       <b>n</b>,<b>N    </b>Numerically justify item in the column: Units positions of
              numbers are aligned vertically.  If there is one or more dots
              adjacent to a digit, use the rightmost one for vertical align‐
              ment.  If there is no dot, use the rightmost digit for verti‐
              cal alignment; otherwise, center the item within the column.
              Alignment can be forced to a certain position using ‘\&amp;’; if
              there is one or more instances of this special (non-printing)
              character present within the data, use the leftmost one for
              alignment.  Example:

                     .TS
                     n.
                     1
                     1.5
                     1.5.3
                     abcde
                     a\&amp;bcde
                     .TE

              Result:

                       1
                       1.5
                     1.5.3
                      abcde
                       abcde

              If numerical entries are combined with <b>L </b>or <b>R </b>entries – this
              can happen if the table format is changed with <b>.T&amp; </b>– center
              the widest <i>number</i> (of the data entered under the <b>N </b>specifier
              regime) relative to the widest <b>L </b>or <b>R </b>entry, preserving the
              alignment of all numerical entries.  Contrary to <b>A </b>type
              entries, there is no extra indentation.

              Using equations (to be processed with <b>eqn</b>) within columns
              which use the <b>N </b>specifier is problematic in most cases due to
              <b>tbl</b>'s algorithm for finding the vertical alignment, as
              described above.  Using the global <b>delim </b>option, however, it
              is possible to make <b>tbl </b>ignore the data within <b>eqn </b>delimiters
              for that purpose.

       <b>r</b>,<b>R    </b>Right-justify item within the column.

       <b>s</b>,<b>S    </b>Span previous item on the left into this column.  Not allowed
              for the first column.

       <b>^      </b>Span down entry from previous row in this column.  Not allowed
              for the first row.

       <b>_</b>,<b>-    </b>Replace this entry with a horizontal line.  Note that ‘_’ and
              ‘-’ can be used for table fields only, not for column separa‐
              tor lines.

       <b>=      </b>Replace this entry with a double horizontal line.  Note that
              ‘=’ can be used for table fields only, not for column separa‐
              tor lines.

       <b>|      </b>The corresponding column becomes a vertical rule (if two of
              these are adjacent, a double vertical rule).

       A vertical bar to the left of the first key letter or to the right of
       the last one produces a line at the edge of the table.

       To change the data format within a table, use the <b>.T&amp; </b>command (at the
       start of a line).  It is followed by format and data lines (but no
       global options) similar to the <b>.TS </b>request.

   <b>Column specifiers</b>
       Here are the specifiers that can appear in suffixes to column key
       letters (in any order):

       <b>b</b>,<b>B    </b>Short form of <b>fB </b>(make affected entries bold).

       <b>d</b>,<b>D    </b>Start an item that vertically spans rows, using the ‘^’ column
              specifier or ‘\^’ data item, at the bottom of its range rather
              than vertically centering it (GNU tbl only).  Example:

                     .TS
                     tab(;) allbox;
                     l l
                     l ld
                     r ^
                     l rd.
                     0000;foobar
                     T{
                     1111
                     .br

                     r;
                     T{
                     3333
                     .br
                     4444
                     T};bar
                     \^;\^
                     .TE

              Result:

                     └─────┴────────┘
       <b>e</b>,<b>E    </b>Make equally-spaced columns.  All columns marked with this
              specifier get the same width; this happens after the affected
              column widths have been computed (this means that the largest
              width value rules).

       <b>f</b>,<b>F    </b>Either of these specifiers may be followed by a font name
              (either one or two characters long), font number (a single
              digit), or long name in parentheses (the last form is a GNU
              tbl extension).  A one-letter font name must be separated by
              one or more blanks from whatever follows.

       <b>i</b>,<b>I    </b>Short form of <b>fI </b>(make affected entries italic).

       <b>m</b>,<b>M    </b>This is a GNU tbl extension.  Either of these specifiers may
              be followed by a macro name (either one or two characters
              long), or long name in parentheses.  A one-letter macro name
              must be separated by one or more blanks from whatever follows.
              The macro which name can be specified here must be defined
              before creating the table.  It is called just before the ta‐
              ble's cell text is output.  As implemented currently, this
              macro is only called if block input is used, that is, text
              between ‘T{’ and ‘T}’.  The macro should contain only simple
              <b>troff </b>requests to change the text block formatting, like text
              adjustment, hyphenation, size, or font.  The macro is called
              <i>after</i> other cell modifications like <b>b</b>, <b>f </b>or <b>v </b>are output.
              Thus the macro can overwrite other modification specifiers.

       <b>p</b>,<b>P    </b>Followed by a number, this does a point size change for the
              affected fields.  If signed, the current point size is incre‐
              mented or decremented (using a signed number instead of a
              signed digit is a GNU tbl extension).  A point size specifier
              followed by a column separation number must be separated by
              one or more blanks.

       <b>t</b>,<b>T    </b>Start an item vertically spanning rows at the top of its range
              rather than vertically centering it.

       <b>u</b>,<b>U    </b>Move the corresponding column up one half-line.

       <b>v</b>,<b>V    </b>Followed by a number, this indicates the vertical line spacing
              to be used in a multi-line table entry.  If signed, the cur‐
              rent vertical line spacing is incremented or decremented
              (using a signed number instead of a signed digit is a GNU tbl
              extension).  A vertical line spacing specifier followed by a
              column separation number must be separated by one or more
              blanks.  No effect if the corresponding table entry isn't a
              text block.

       <b>w</b>,<b>W    </b>Minimum column width value.  Must be followed either by a
              <a href="troff.1.html">troff(1)</a> width expression in parentheses or a unitless inte‐
              ger.  If no unit is given, en units are used.  Also used as
              the default line length for included text blocks.  If used
              multiple times to specify the width for a particular column,
              the last entry takes effect.

       <b>x</b>,<b>X    </b>An expanded column.  After computing all column widths without
              an <b>x </b>specifier, use the remaining line width for this column.
              If there is more than one expanded column, distribute the
              remaining horizontal space evenly among the affected columns
              (this is a GNU extension).  This feature has the same effect
              as specifying a minimum column width.

       <b>z</b>,<b>Z    </b>Ignore the corresponding column for width-calculation pur‐
              poses, this is, don't use the fields but only the specifiers
              of this column to compute its width.

       A number suffix on a key character is interpreted as a column separa‐
       tion in en units (multiplied in proportion if the <b>expand </b>option is on
       – in case of overfull tables this might be zero).  Default separation
       is 3n.

       The column specifier <b>x </b>is mutually exclusive with <b>e </b>and <b>w </b>(but <b>e </b>is
       not mutually exclusive with <b>w</b>); if specified multiple times for a
       particular column, the last entry takes effect: <b>x </b>unsets both <b>e</b>
       and <b>w</b>, while either <b>e </b>or <b>w </b>overrides <b>x</b>.

   <b>Table data</b>
       The format lines are followed by lines containing the actual data for
       the table, followed finally by <b>.TE</b>.  Within such data lines, items
       are normally separated by tab characters (or the character specified
       with the <b>tab </b>option).  Long input lines can be broken across multiple
       lines if the last character on the line is ‘\’ (which vanishes after
       concatenation).

       Note that <b>tbl </b>computes the column widths line by line, applying \w on
       each entry which isn't a text block.  As a consequence, constructions
       like

              .TS
              c,l.
              \s[20]MM
              MMMM
              .TE

       fail; you must either say

              .TS
              cp20,lp20.
              MM
              MMMM
              .TE

       or

              .TS
              c,l.
              \s[20]MM
              \s[20]MMMM
              .TE

       A dot starting a line, followed by anything but a digit is handled as
       a troff command, passed through without changes.  The table position
       is unchanged in this case.

       If a data line consists of only ‘_’ or ‘=’, a single or double line,
       respectively, is drawn across the table at that point; if a single
       item in a data line consists of only ‘_’ or ‘=’, then that item is
       replaced by a single or double line, joining its neighbours.  If a
       data item consists only of ‘\_’ or ‘\=’, a single or double line,
       respectively, is drawn across the field at that point which does not
       join its neighbours.

       A data item consisting only of ‘\Rx’ (‘x’ any character) is replaced
       by repetitions of character ‘x’ as wide as the column (not joining
       its neighbours).

       A data item consisting only of ‘\^’ indicates that the field immedi‐
       ately above spans downward over this row.

   <b>Text blocks</b>
       A text block can be used to enter data as a single entry which would
       be too long as a simple string between tabs.  It is started with ‘T{’
       and closed with ‘T}’.  The former must end a line, and the latter
       must start a line, probably followed by other data columns (separated
       with tabs or the character given with the <b>tab </b>global option).

       By default, the text block is formatted with the settings which were
       active before entering the table, possibly overridden by the <b>m</b>, <b>v</b>,
       and <b>w </b>tbl specifiers.  For example, to make all text blocks ragged-
       right, insert <b>.na </b>right before the starting <b>.TS </b>(and <b>.ad </b>after the
       table).

       If either ‘w’ or ‘x[cq] specifiers are not given for <i>all</i> columns of a
       text block span, the default length of the text block (to be more
       precise, the line length used to process the text block diversion) is
       computed as L×C/(N+1), where ‘L’ is the current line length, ‘C’ the
       number of columns spanned by the text block, and ‘N’ the total number
       of columns in the table.  Note, however, that the actual diversion
       width as returned in register <b>\n[dl] </b>is used eventually as the text
       block width.  If necessary, you can also control the text block width
       with a direct insertion of a <b>.ll </b>request right after ‘T{’.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       The number register <b>\n[TW] </b>holds the table width; it can't be used
       within the table itself but is defined right before calling <b>.TE </b>so
       that this macro can make use of it.

       <b>tbl </b>also defines a macro <b>.T# </b>which produces the bottom and side lines
       of a boxed table.  While <b>tbl </b>does call this macro itself at the end
       of the table, it can be used by macro packages to create boxes for
       multi-page tables by calling it within the page footer.  An example
       of this is shown by the <b>-ms </b>macros which provide this functionality
       if a table starts with <b>.TS H </b>instead of the standard call to the <b>.TS</b>
       macro.

       There is no limit on the number of columns in a table, nor any limit
       on the number of text blocks.  All the lines of a table are
       considered in deciding column widths, not just the first 200.  Table
       continuation (<b>.T&amp;</b>) lines are not restricted to the first 200 lines.

       Numeric and alphabetic items may appear in the same column.

       Numeric and alphabetic items may span horizontally.

       <b>tbl </b>uses register, string, macro and diversion names beginning with
       the digit <b>3</b>.  When using <b>tbl </b>you should avoid using any names
       beginning with a <b>3</b>.

       Since <b>tbl </b>defines its own macros (right before each table) it is
       necessary to use an ‘end-of-macro’ macro.  Additionally, the escape
       character has to be switched off.  Here an example.

              .eo
              .de ATABLE ..
              .TS
              allbox tab(;);
              cl.
              \$1;\$2
              .TE
              ...
              .ec
              .ATABLE A table
              .ATABLE Another table
              .ATABLE And "another one"

       Note, however, that not all features of <b>tbl </b>can be wrapped into a
       macro because <b>tbl </b>sees the input earlier than <b>troff</b>.  For example,
       number formatting with vertically aligned decimal points fails if
       those numbers are passed on as macro parameters because decimal point
       alignment is handled by <b>tbl </b>itself: It only sees ‘\$1’, ‘\$2’, etc.,
       and therefore can't recognize the decimal point.

       You should use <b>.TS H</b>/<b>.TH </b>in conjunction with a supporting macro
       package for <i>all</i> multi-page boxed tables.  If there is no header that
       you wish to appear at the top of each page of the table, place the
       <b>.TH </b>line immediately after the format section.  Do not enclose a
       multi-page table within keep/release macros, or divert it in any
       other way.

       A text block within a table must be able to fit on one page.

       The <b>bp </b>request cannot be used to force a page-break in a multi-page
       table.  Instead, define <b>BP </b>as follows

              .de BP
              .  ie '\\n(.z'' .bp \\$1
              .  el \!.BP \\$1
              ..

       and use <b>BP </b>instead of <b>bp</b>.

       Using \a directly in a table to get leaders does not work (except in
       compatibility mode).  This is correct behaviour: \a is an <b>uninter‐</b>
       <b>preted </b>leader.  To get leaders use a real leader, either by using a
       control A or like this:

              .ds a \a
              .TS
              tab(;);
              lw(1i) l.
              A\*a;B
              .TE

       A leading and/or trailing ‘|’ in a format line, such as

              |l r|.

       gives output which has a 1n space between the resulting bordering
       vertical rule and the content of the adjacent column, as in

              .TS
              tab(#);
              |l r|.
              left column#right column
              .TE

       If it is desired to have zero space (so that the rule touches the
       content), this can be achieved by introducing extra “dummy” columns,
       with no content and zero separation, before and/or after, as in

              .TS
              tab(#);
              r0|l r0|l.
              #left column#right column#
              .TE

       The resulting “dummy” columns are invisible and have zero width; note
       that such columns usually don't work with TTY devices.
