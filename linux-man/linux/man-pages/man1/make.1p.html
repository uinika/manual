<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>make</i> utility shall update files that are derived from other
       files. A typical case is one where object files are derived from the
       corresponding source files. The <i>make</i> utility examines time
       relationships and shall update those derived files (called targets)
       that have modified times earlier than the modified times of the files
       (called prerequisites) from which they are derived.  A description
       file (makefile) contains a description of the relationships between
       files, and the commands that need to be executed to update the
       targets to reflect changes in their prerequisites. Each
       specification, or rule, shall consist of a target, optional
       prerequisites, and optional commands to be executed when a
       prerequisite is newer than the target. There are two types of rule:

        1. <i>Inference rules</i>, which have one target name with at least one
           &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  and no &lt;slash&gt; (<b>'/'</b>)

        2. <i>Target rules</i>, which can have more than one target name

       In addition, <i>make</i> shall have a collection of built-in macros and
       inference rules that infer prerequisite relationships to simplify
       maintenance of programs.

       To receive exactly the behavior described in this section, the user
       shall ensure that a portable makefile shall:

        *  Include the special target <b>.POSIX</b>

        *  Omit any special target reserved for implementations (a leading
           period followed by uppercase letters) that has not been specified
           by this section

       The behavior of <i>make</i> is unspecified if either or both of these
       conditions are not met.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>make</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except for
       Guideline 9.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>−e        </b>Cause environment variables, including those with null
                 values, to override macro assignments within makefiles.

       <b>−f </b><i>makefile</i>
                 Specify a different makefile. The argument <i>makefile</i> is a
                 pathname of a description file, which is also referred to
                 as the <i>makefile</i>.  A pathname of <b>'−' </b>shall denote the
                 standard input. There can be multiple instances of this
                 option, and they shall be processed in the order specified.
                 The effect of specifying the same option-argument more than
                 once is unspecified.

       <b>−i        </b>Ignore error codes returned by invoked commands. This mode
                 is the same as if the special target <b>.IGNORE </b>were specified
                 without prerequisites.

       <b>−k        </b>Continue to update other targets that do not depend on the
                 current target if a non-ignored error occurs while
                 executing the commands to bring a target up-to-date.

       <b>−n        </b>Write commands that would be executed on standard output,
                 but do not execute them. However, lines with a &lt;plus-sign&gt;
                 (<b>'+'</b>) prefix shall be executed. In this mode, lines with an
                 at-sign (<b>'@'</b>) character prefix shall be written to standard
                 output.

       <b>−p        </b>Write to standard output the complete set of macro
                 definitions and target descriptions. The output format is
                 unspecified.

       <b>−q        </b>Return a zero exit value if the target file is up-to-date;
                 otherwise, return an exit value of 1. Targets shall not be
                 updated if this option is specified. However, a makefile
                 command line (associated with the targets) with a &lt;plus-
                 sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) prefix shall be executed.

       <b>−r        </b>Clear the suffix list and do not use the built-in rules.

       <b>−S        </b>Terminate <i>make</i> if an error occurs while executing the
                 commands to bring a target up-to-date. This shall be the
                 default and the opposite of <b>−k</b>.

       <b>−s        </b>Do not write makefile command lines or touch messages (see
                 <b>−t</b>) to standard output before executing. This mode shall be
                 the same as if the special target <b>.SILENT </b>were specified
                 without prerequisites.

       <b>−t        </b>Update the modification time of each target as though a
                 <i>touch target</i> had been executed. Targets that have
                 prerequisites but no commands (see <i>Target Rules</i>), or that
                 are already up-to-date, shall not be touched in this
                 manner.  Write messages to standard output for each target
                 file indicating the name of the file and that it was
                 touched. Normally, the <i>makefile</i> command lines associated
                 with each target are not executed. However, a command line
                 with a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) prefix shall be executed.

       Any options specified in the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment variable shall be
       evaluated before any options specified on the <i>make</i> utility command
       line. If the <b>−k </b>and <b>−S </b>options are both specified on the <i>make</i> utility
       command line or by the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment variable, the last
       option specified shall take precedence.  If the <b>−f </b>or <b>−p </b>options
       appear in the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment variable, the result is
       undefined.

       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>target_name</i>
                 Target names, as defined in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
                 section. If no target is specified, while <i>make</i> is
                 processing the makefiles, the first target that <i>make</i>
                 encounters that is not a special target or an inference
                 rule shall be used.

       <i>macro</i>=<i>value</i>
                 Macro definitions, as defined in <i>Macros</i>.

       If the <i>target_name</i> and <i>macro</i>=<i>value</i> operands are intermixed on the
       <i>make</i> utility command line, the results are unspecified.

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>make</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 8.2</i>, <i>Internationalization</i>
                 <i>Variables</i> for the precedence of internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale
                 categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
                 as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input
                 files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>MAKEFLAGS</i>
                 This variable shall be interpreted as a character string
                 representing a series of option characters to be used as
                 the default options. The implementation shall accept both
                 of the following formats (but need not accept them when
                 intermixed):

                  *  The characters are option letters without the leading
                     &lt;hyphen&gt; characters or &lt;blank&gt; separation used on a
                     <i>make</i> utility command line.

                  *  The characters are formatted in a manner similar to a
                     portion of the <i>make</i> utility command line: options are
                     preceded by &lt;hyphen&gt; characters and &lt;blank&gt;-separated
                     as described in the Base Definitions volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.
                     The <i>macro</i>=<i>value</i> macro definition operands can also be
                     included. The difference between the contents of
                     <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> and the <i>make</i> utility command line is that the
                     contents of the variable shall not be subjected to the
                     word expansions (see <i>Section 2.6</i>, <i>Word Expansions</i>)
                     associated with parsing the command line values.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PROJECTDIR</i>
                 Provide a directory to be used to search for SCCS files not
                 found in the current directory. In all of the following
                 cases, the search for SCCS files is made in the directory
                 <b>SCCS </b>in the identified directory. If the value of
                 <i>PROJECTDIR</i> begins with a &lt;slash&gt;, it shall be considered an
                 absolute pathname; otherwise, the value of <i>PROJECTDIR</i> is
                 treated as a user name and that user's initial working
                 directory shall be examined for a subdirectory <b>src </b>or
                 <b>source</b>.  If such a directory is found, it shall be used.
                 Otherwise, the value is used as a relative pathname.

                 If <i>PROJECTDIR</i> is not set or has a null value, the search
                 for SCCS files shall be made in the directory <b>SCCS </b>in the
                 current directory.

                 The setting of <i>PROJECTDIR</i> affects all files listed in the
                 remainder of this utility description for files with a
                 component named <b>SCCS</b>.

       The value of the <i>SHELL</i> environment variable shall not be used as a
       macro and shall not be modified by defining the <b>SHELL </b>macro in a
       makefile or on the command line. All other environment variables,
       including those with null values, shall be used as macros, as defined
       in <i>Macros</i>.

       If not already ignored, <i>make</i> shall trap SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGINT, and

       <b>.PRECIOUS </b>or unless one of the <b>−n</b>, <b>−p</b>, or <b>−q </b>options was specified.

<h2><a id="EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION" href="#EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION"></a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>make</i> utility attempts to perform the actions required to ensure
       that the specified targets are up-to-date. A target is considered
       out-of-date if it is older than any of its prerequisites or if it
       does not exist.  The <i>make</i> utility shall treat all prerequisites as
       targets themselves and recursively ensure that they are up-to-date,
       processing them in the order in which they appear in the rule. The
       <i>make</i> utility shall use the modification times of files to determine
       whether the corresponding targets are out-of-date.

       After <i>make</i> has ensured that all of the prerequisites of a target are
       up-to-date and if the target is out-of-date, the commands associated
       with the target entry shall be executed. If there are no commands
       listed for the target, the target shall be treated as up-to-date.

   <b>Makefile Syntax</b>
       A makefile can contain rules, macro definitions (see <i>Macros</i>), include
       lines, and comments. There are two kinds of rules: <i>inference rules</i>
       and <i>target rules</i>.  The <i>make</i> utility shall contain a set of built-in
       inference rules. If the <b>−r </b>option is present, the built-in rules
       shall not be used and the suffix list shall be cleared. Additional
       rules of both types can be specified in a makefile. If a rule is
       defined more than once, the value of the rule shall be that of the
       last one specified. Macros can also be defined more than once, and
       the value of the macro is specified in <i>Macros</i>.  Comments start with a
       &lt;number-sign&gt; (<b>'#'</b>) and continue until an unescaped &lt;newline&gt; is
       reached.

       By default, the following files shall be tried in sequence:
       <b>./makefile </b>and <b>./Makefile</b>.  If neither <b>./makefile </b>or <b>./Makefile </b>are
       found, other implementation-defined files may also be tried.  On XSI-
       conformant systems, the additional files <b>./s.makefile</b>,
       <b>SCCS/s.makefile</b>, <b>./s.Makefile</b>, and <b>SCCS/s.Makefile </b>shall also be
       tried.

       The <b>−f </b>option shall direct <i>make</i> to ignore any of these default files
       and use the specified argument as a makefile instead. If the <b>'−'</b>
       argument is specified, standard input shall be used.

       The term <i>makefile</i> is used to refer to any rules provided by the user,
       whether in <b>./makefile </b>or its variants, or specified by the <b>−f </b>option.

       The rules in makefiles shall consist of the following types of lines:
       target rules, including special targets (see <i>Target Rules</i>), inference
       rules (see <i>Inference Rules</i>), macro definitions (see <i>Macros</i>), empty
       lines, and comments.

       Target and Inference Rules may contain <i>command lines</i>.  Command lines
       can have a prefix that shall be removed before execution (see
       <i>Makefile Execution</i>).

       When an escaped &lt;newline&gt; (one preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;) is found
       anywhere in the makefile except in a command line, an include line,
       or a line immediately preceding an include line, it shall be
       replaced, along with any leading white space on the following line,
       with a single &lt;space&gt;.  When an escaped &lt;newline&gt; is found in a
       command line in a makefile, the command line shall contain the
       &lt;backslash&gt;, the &lt;newline&gt;, and the next line, except that the first
       character of the next line shall not be included if it is a &lt;tab&gt;.
       When an escaped &lt;newline&gt; is found in an include line or in a line
       immediately preceding an include line, the behavior is unspecified.

   <b>Include Lines</b>
       If the word <b>include </b>appears at the beginning of a line and is
       followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, the string formed by the
       remainder of the line shall be processed as follows to produce a
       pathname:

        *  The trailing &lt;newline&gt; and any comment shall be discarded. If the
           resulting string contains any double-quote characters (<b>'"'</b>) the
           behavior is unspecified.

        *  The resulting string shall be processed for macro expansion (see
           <i>Macros</i>.

        *  Any &lt;blank&gt; characters that appear after the first non-&lt;blank&gt;
           shall be used as separators to divide the macro-expanded string
           into fields. It is unspecified whether any other white-space
           characters are also used as separators. It is unspecified whether
           pathname expansion (see <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching Notation</i>)
           is also performed.

        *  If the processing of separators and optional pathname expansion
           results in either zero or two or more non-empty fields, the
           behavior is unspecified. If it results in one non-empty field,
           that field is taken as the pathname.

       If the pathname does not begin with a <b>'/' </b>it shall be treated as
       relative to the current working directory of the process, not
       relative to the directory containing the makefile.  If the file does
       not exist in this location, it is unspecified whether additional
       directories are searched.

       The contents of the file specified by the pathname shall be read and
       processed as if they appeared in the makefile in place of the include
       line. If the file ends with an escaped &lt;newline&gt; the behavior is
       unspecified.

       The file may itself contain further include lines. Implementations
       shall support nesting of include files up to a depth of at least 16.

   <b>Makefile Execution</b>
       Makefile command lines shall be processed one at a time.

       Makefile command lines can have one or more of the following
       prefixes: a &lt;hyphen&gt; (<b>'-'</b>), an at-sign (<b>'@'</b>), or a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>).
       These shall modify the way in which <i>make</i> processes the command.

       −     If the command prefix contains a &lt;hyphen&gt;, or the <b>−i </b>option is
             present, or the special target <b>.IGNORE </b>has either the current
             target as a prerequisite or has no prerequisites, any error
             found while executing the command shall be ignored.

       @     If the command prefix contains an at-sign and the <i>make</i> utility
             command line <b>−n </b>option is not specified, or the <b>−s </b>option is
             present, or the special target <b>.SILENT </b>has either the current
             target as a prerequisite or has no prerequisites, the command
             shall not be written to standard output before it is executed.

       +     If the command prefix contains a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, this indicates a
             makefile command line that shall be executed even if <b>−n</b>, <b>−q</b>, or
             <b>−t </b>is specified.

       An <i>execution line</i> is built from the command line by removing any
       prefix characters. Except as described under the at-sign prefix, the
       execution line shall be written to the standard output, optionally
       preceded by a &lt;tab&gt;.  The execution line shall then be executed by a
       shell as if it were passed as the argument to the <i>system</i>() interface,
       except that if errors are not being ignored then the shell <b>−e </b>option
       shall also be in effect. If errors are being ignored for the command
       (as a result of the <b>−i </b>option, a <b>'−' </b>command prefix, or a <b>.IGNORE</b>
       special target), the shell <b>−e </b>option shall not be in effect. The
       environment for the command being executed shall contain all of the
       variables in the environment of <i>make</i>.

       By default, when <i>make</i> receives a non-zero status from the execution
       of a command, it shall terminate with an error message to standard
       error.

   <b>Target Rules</b>
       Target rules are formatted as follows:

           <i>target</i> <b>[</b><i>target</i>...<b>]</b>: <b>[</b><i>prerequisite</i>...<b>][;</b><i>command</i><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>&lt;tab&gt;<i>command</i>
           &lt;tab&gt;<i>command</i>
           ...<b>]</b>

           <i>line that does not begin with</i> &lt;tab&gt;

       Target entries are specified by a &lt;blank&gt;-separated, non-null list of
       targets, then a &lt;colon&gt;, then a &lt;blank&gt;-separated, possibly empty
       list of prerequisites. Text following a &lt;semicolon&gt;, if any, and all
       following lines that begin with a &lt;tab&gt;, are makefile command lines
       to be executed to update the target. The first non-empty line that
       does not begin with a &lt;tab&gt; or <b>'#' </b>shall begin a new entry. An empty
       or blank line, or a line beginning with <b>'#'</b>, may begin a new entry.

       Applications shall select target names from the set of characters
       consisting solely of periods, underscores, digits, and alphabetics
       from the portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).  Implementations
       may allow other characters in target names as extensions. The
       interpretation of targets containing the characters <b>'%' </b>and <b>'"' </b>is
       implementation-defined.

       A target that has prerequisites, but does not have any commands, can
       be used to add to the prerequisite list for that target. Only one
       target rule for any given target can contain commands.

       Lines that begin with one of the following are called <i>special targets</i>
       and control the operation of <i>make</i>:

       <b>.DEFAULT  </b>If the makefile uses this special target, the application
                 shall ensure that it is specified with commands, but
                 without prerequisites. The commands shall be used by <i>make</i>
                 if there are no other rules available to build a target.

       <b>.IGNORE   </b>Prerequisites of this special target are targets
                 themselves; this shall cause errors from commands
                 associated with them to be ignored in the same manner as
                 specified by the <b>−i </b>option. Subsequent occurrences of
                 <b>.IGNORE </b>shall add to the list of targets ignoring command
                 errors. If no prerequisites are specified, <i>make</i> shall
                 behave as if the <b>−i </b>option had been specified and errors
                 from all commands associated with all targets shall be
                 ignored.

       <b>.POSIX    </b>The application shall ensure that this special target is
                 specified without prerequisites or commands. If it appears
                 as the first non-comment line in the makefile, <i>make</i> shall
                 process the makefile as specified by this section;
                 otherwise, the behavior of <i>make</i> is unspecified.

       <b>.PRECIOUS </b>Prerequisites of this special target shall not be removed
                 if <i>make</i> receives one of the asynchronous events explicitly
                 described in the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section. Subsequent
                 occurrences of <b>.PRECIOUS </b>shall add to the list of precious
                 files. If no prerequisites are specified, all targets in
                 the makefile shall be treated as if specified with
                 <b>.PRECIOUS</b>.

       <b>.SCCS_GET </b>The application shall ensure that this special target is
                 specified without prerequisites. If this special target is
                 included in a makefile, the commands specified with this
                 target shall replace the default commands associated with
                 this special target (see <i>Default Rules</i>).  The commands
                 specified with this target are used to get all SCCS files
                 that are not found in the current directory.

                 When source files are named in a dependency list, <i>make</i>
                 shall treat them just like any other target. Because the
                 source file is presumed to be present in the directory,
                 there is no need to add an entry for it to the makefile.
                 When a target has no dependencies, but is present in the
                 directory, <i>make</i> shall assume that that file is up-to-date.
                 If, however, an SCCS file named <b>SCCS/s.</b><i>source_file</i> is found
                 for a target <i>source_file</i>, <i>make</i> compares the timestamp of
                 the target file with that of the <b>SCCS/s.source_file </b>to
                 ensure the target is up-to-date. If the target is missing,
                 or if the SCCS file is newer, <i>make</i> shall automatically
                 issue the commands specified for the <b>.SCCS_GET </b>special
                 target to retrieve the most recent version. However, if the
                 target is writable by anyone, <i>make</i> shall not retrieve a new
                 version.

       <b>.SILENT   </b>Prerequisites of this special target are targets
                 themselves; this shall cause commands associated with them
                 not to be written to the standard output before they are
                 executed. Subsequent occurrences of <b>.SILENT </b>shall add to
                 the list of targets with silent commands. If no
                 prerequisites are specified, <i>make</i> shall behave as if the <b>−s</b>
                 option had been specified and no commands or touch messages
                 associated with any target shall be written to standard
                 output.

       <b>.SUFFIXES </b>Prerequisites of <b>.SUFFIXES </b>shall be appended to the list of
                 known suffixes and are used in conjunction with the
                 inference rules (see <i>Inference Rules</i>).  If <b>.SUFFIXES </b>does
                 not have any prerequisites, the list of known suffixes
                 shall be cleared.

       The special targets <b>.IGNORE</b>, <b>.POSIX</b>, <b>.PRECIOUS</b>, <b>.SILENT</b>, and
       <b>.SUFFIXES </b>shall be specified without commands.

       Targets with names consisting of a leading &lt;period&gt; followed by the
       uppercase letters <b>"POSIX" </b>and then any other characters are reserved
       for future standardization.  Targets with names consisting of a
       leading &lt;period&gt; followed by one or more uppercase letters are
       reserved for implementation extensions.

   <b>Macros</b>
       Macro definitions are in the form:

           <i>string1</i> = <b>[</b><i>string2</i><b>]</b>

       The macro named <i>string1</i> is defined as having the value of <i>string2</i>,
       where <i>string2</i> is defined as all characters, if any, after the
       &lt;equals-sign&gt;, up to a comment character (<b>'#'</b>) or an unescaped
       &lt;newline&gt;.  Any &lt;blank&gt; characters immediately before or after the
       &lt;equals-sign&gt; shall be ignored.

       Applications shall select macro names from the set of characters
       consisting solely of periods, underscores, digits, and alphabetics
       from the portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).  A macro name
       shall not contain an &lt;equals-sign&gt;.  Implementations may allow other
       characters in macro names as extensions.

       Macros can appear anywhere in the makefile. Macro expansions using
       the forms $(<i>string1</i>) or ${<i>string1</i>} shall be replaced by <i>string2</i>, as
       follows:

        *  Macros in target lines shall be evaluated when the target line is
           read.

        *  Macros in makefile command lines shall be evaluated when the
           command is executed.

        *  Macros in the string before the &lt;equals-sign&gt; in a macro
           definition shall be evaluated when the macro assignment is made.

        *  Macros after the &lt;equals-sign&gt; in a macro definition shall not be
           evaluated until the defined macro is used in a rule or command,
           or before the &lt;equals-sign&gt; in a macro definition.

       The parentheses or braces are optional if <i>string1</i> is a single
       character. The macro $$ shall be replaced by the single character
       <b>'$'</b>.  If <i>string1</i> in a macro expansion contains a macro expansion, the
       results are unspecified.

       Macro expansions using the forms $(<i>string1</i><b>[:</b><i>subst1</i><b>=[</b><i>subst2</i><b>]]</b>) or
       ${<i>string1</i><b>[:</b><i>subst1</i><b>=[</b><i>subst2</i><b>]]</b>} can be used to replace all occurrences
       of <i>subst1</i> with <i>subst2</i> when the macro substitution is performed. The
       <i>subst1</i> to be replaced shall be recognized when it is a suffix at the
       end of a word in <i>string1</i> (where a <i>word</i>, in this context, is defined
       to be a string delimited by the beginning of the line, a &lt;blank&gt;, or
       a &lt;newline&gt;).  If <i>string1</i> in a macro expansion contains a macro
       expansion, the results are unspecified.

       Macro expansions in <i>string1</i> of macro definition lines shall be
       evaluated when read. Macro expansions in <i>string2</i> of macro definition
       lines shall be performed when the macro identified by <i>string1</i> is
       expanded in a rule or command.

       Macro definitions shall be taken from the following sources, in the
       following logical order, before the makefile(s) are read.

        1. Macros specified on the <i>make</i> utility command line, in the order
           specified on the command line. It is unspecified whether the
           internal macros defined in <i>Internal Macros</i> are accepted from this
           source.

        2. Macros defined by the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment variable, in the
           order specified in the environment variable. It is unspecified
           whether the internal macros defined in <i>Internal Macros</i> are
           accepted from this source.

        3. The contents of the environment, excluding the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> and
           <i>SHELL</i> variables and including the variables with null values.

        4. Macros defined in the inference rules built into <i>make</i>.

       Macro definitions from these sources shall not override macro
       definitions from a lower-numbered source. Macro definitions from a
       single source (for example, the <i>make</i> utility command line, the
       <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment variable, or the other environment variables)
       shall override previous macro definitions from the same source.

       Macros defined in the makefile(s) shall override macro definitions
       that occur before them in the makefile(s) and macro definitions from
       source 4. If the <b>−e </b>option is not specified, macros defined in the
       makefile(s) shall override macro definitions from source 3. Macros
       defined in the makefile(s) shall not override macro definitions from
       source 1 or source 2.

       Before the makefile(s) are read, all of the <i>make</i> utility command line
       options (except <b>−f </b>and <b>−p</b>) and <i>make</i> utility command line macro
       definitions (except any for the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro), not already
       included in the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro, shall be added to the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i>
       macro, quoted in an implementation-defined manner such that when
       <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> is read by another instance of the <i>make</i> command, the
       original macro's value is recovered. Other implementation-defined
       options and macros may also be added to the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro. If this
       modifies the value of the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro, or, if the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro
       is modified at any subsequent time, the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> environment
       variable shall be modified to match the new value of the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i>
       macro. The result of setting <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> in the Makefile is
       unspecified.

       Before the makefile(s) are read, all of the <i>make</i> utility command line
       macro definitions (except the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> macro or the <i>SHELL</i> macro)
       shall be added to the environment of <i>make</i>.  Other implementation-
       defined variables may also be added to the environment of <i>make</i>.

       The <b>SHELL </b>macro shall be treated specially. It shall be provided by
       <i>make</i> and set to the pathname of the shell command language
       interpreter (see <a href="sh.1p.html">sh(1p)</a>).  The <i>SHELL</i> environment variable shall not
       affect the value of the <b>SHELL </b>macro. If <b>SHELL </b>is defined in the
       makefile or is specified on the command line, it shall replace the
       original value of the <b>SHELL </b>macro, but shall not affect the <i>SHELL</i>
       environment variable. Other effects of defining <b>SHELL </b>in the makefile
       or on the command line are implementation-defined.

   <b>Inference Rules</b>
       Inference rules are formatted as follows:

           <i>target</i>:
           &lt;tab&gt;<i>command</i>
           <b>[</b>&lt;tab&gt;<i>command</i><b>]</b>
           ...

           <i>line that does not begin with</i> &lt;tab&gt; <i>or</i> #

       The application shall ensure that the <i>target</i> portion is a valid
       target name (see <i>Target Rules</i>) of the form <b>.s2 </b>or <b>.s1.s2 </b>(where <b>.s1</b>
       and <b>.s2 </b>are suffixes that have been given as prerequisites of the
       <b>.SUFFIXES </b>special target and <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> do not contain any &lt;slash&gt; or
       &lt;period&gt; characters.) If there is only one &lt;period&gt; in the target, it
       is a single-suffix inference rule. Targets with two periods are
       double-suffix inference rules. Inference rules can have only one
       target before the &lt;colon&gt;.

       The application shall ensure that the makefile does not specify
       prerequisites for inference rules; no characters other than white
       space shall follow the &lt;colon&gt; in the first line, except when
       creating the <i>empty rule,</i> described below. Prerequisites are inferred,
       as described below.

       Inference rules can be redefined. A target that matches an existing
       inference rule shall overwrite the old inference rule. An empty rule
       can be created with a command consisting of simply a &lt;semicolon&gt;
       (that is, the rule still exists and is found during inference rule
       search, but since it is empty, execution has no effect). The empty
       rule can also be formatted as follows:

           <i>rule</i>: ;

       where zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters separate the &lt;colon&gt; and
       &lt;semicolon&gt;.

       The <i>make</i> utility uses the suffixes of targets and their prerequisites
       to infer how a target can be made up-to-date. A list of inference
       rules defines the commands to be executed. By default, <i>make</i> contains
       a built-in set of inference rules. Additional rules can be specified
       in the makefile.

       The special target <b>.SUFFIXES </b>contains as its prerequisites a list of
       suffixes that shall be used by the inference rules. The order in
       which the suffixes are specified defines the order in which the
       inference rules for the suffixes are used. New suffixes shall be
       appended to the current list by specifying a <b>.SUFFIXES </b>special target
       in the makefile. A <b>.SUFFIXES </b>target with no prerequisites shall clear
       the list of suffixes. An empty <b>.SUFFIXES </b>target followed by a new
       <b>.SUFFIXES </b>list is required to change the order of the suffixes.

       Normally, the user would provide an inference rule for each suffix.
       The inference rule to update a target with a suffix <b>.s1 </b>from a
       prerequisite with a suffix <b>.s2 </b>is specified as a target <b>.s2.s1</b>.  The
       internal macros provide the means to specify general inference rules
       (see <i>Internal Macros</i>).

       When no target rule is found to update a target, the inference rules
       shall be checked. The suffix of the target (<b>.s1</b>) to be built is
       compared to the list of suffixes specified by the <b>.SUFFIXES </b>special
       targets. If the <b>.s1 </b>suffix is found in <b>.SUFFIXES</b>, the inference rules
       shall be searched in the order defined for the first <b>.s2.s1 </b>rule
       whose prerequisite file (<b>$*.s2</b>) exists. If the target is out-of-date
       with respect to this prerequisite, the commands for that inference
       rule shall be executed.

       If the target to be built does not contain a suffix and there is no
       rule for the target, the single suffix inference rules shall be
       checked. The single-suffix inference rules define how to build a
       target if a file is found with a name that matches the target name
       with one of the single suffixes appended. A rule with one suffix <b>.s2</b>
       is the definition of how to build <i>target</i> from <b>target.s2</b>.  The other
       suffix (<b>.s1</b>) is treated as null.

       A &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>) in the above rules refers to an SCCS file in the
       current directory.  Thus, the rule <b>.c~.o </b>would transform an SCCS C-
       language source file into an object file (<b>.o</b>).  Because the <b>s.  </b>of
       the SCCS files is a prefix, it is incompatible with <i>make</i>'s suffix
       point of view. Hence, the <b>'~' </b>is a way of changing any file reference
       into an SCCS file reference.

       If a target or prerequisite contains parentheses, it shall be treated
       as a member of an archive library. For the <i>lib</i>(<i>member</i><b>.o</b>) expression
       <i>lib</i> refers to the name of the archive library and <i>member</i><b>.o </b>to the
       member name. The application shall ensure that the member is an
       object file with the <b>.o </b>suffix. The modification time of the
       expression is the modification time for the member as kept in the
       archive library; see <a href="ar.1p.html">ar(1p)</a>.  The <b>.a </b>suffix shall refer to an archive
       library. The <b>.s2.a </b>rule shall be used to update a member in the
       library from a file with a suffix <b>.s2</b>.

   <b>Internal Macros</b>
       The <i>make</i> utility shall maintain five internal macros that can be used
       in target and inference rules. In order to clearly define the meaning
       of these macros, some clarification of the terms <i>target rule</i>,
       <i>inference rule</i>, <i>target</i>, and <i>prerequisite</i> is necessary.

       Target rules are specified by the user in a makefile for a particular
       target. Inference rules are user-specified or <i>make</i>-specified rules
       for a particular class of target name. Explicit prerequisites are
       those prerequisites specified in a makefile on target lines.
       Implicit prerequisites are those prerequisites that are generated
       when inference rules are used. Inference rules are applied to
       implicit prerequisites or to explicit prerequisites that do not have
       target rules defined for them in the makefile. Target rules are
       applied to targets specified in the makefile.

       Before any target in the makefile is updated, each of its
       prerequisites (both explicit and implicit) shall be updated. This
       shall be accomplished by recursively processing each prerequisite.
       Upon recursion, each prerequisite shall become a target itself. Its
       prerequisites in turn shall be processed recursively until a target
       is found that has no prerequisites, at which point the recursion
       stops.  The recursion shall then back up, updating each target as it
       goes.

       In the definitions that follow, the word <i>target</i> refers to one of:

        *  A target specified in the makefile

        *  An explicit prerequisite specified in the makefile that becomes
           the target when <i>make</i> processes it during recursion

        *  An implicit prerequisite that becomes a target when <i>make</i>
           processes it during recursion

       In the definitions that follow, the word <i>prerequisite</i> refers to one
       of the following:

        *  An explicit prerequisite specified in the makefile for a
           particular target

        *  An implicit prerequisite generated as a result of locating an
           appropriate inference rule and corresponding file that matches
           the suffix of the target

       The five internal macros are:

       $@      The $@ shall evaluate to the full target name of the current
               target, or the archive filename part of a library archive
               target. It shall be evaluated for both target and inference
               rules.

               For example, in the <b>.c.a </b>inference rule, $@ represents the
               out-of-date <b>.a </b>file to be built. Similarly, in a makefile
               target rule to build <b>lib.a </b>from <b>file.c</b>, $@ represents the
               out-of-date <b>lib.a</b>.

       $%      The $% macro shall be evaluated only when the current target
               is an archive library member of the form <i>libname</i>(<i>member</i><b>.o</b>).
               In these cases, $@ shall evaluate to <i>libname</i> and $% shall
               evaluate to <i>member</i><b>.o</b>.  The $% macro shall be evaluated for
               both target and inference rules.

               For example, in a makefile target rule to build
               <b>lib.a</b>(<b>file.o</b>), $% represents <b>file.o</b>, as opposed to $@, which
               represents <b>lib.a</b>.

       $?      The $? macro shall evaluate to the list of prerequisites that
               are newer than the current target. It shall be evaluated for
               both target and inference rules.

               For example, in a makefile target rule to build <i>prog</i> from
               <b>file1.o</b>, <b>file2.o</b>, and <b>file3.o</b>, and where <i>prog</i> is not out-of-
               date with respect to <b>file1.o</b>, but is out-of-date with respect
               to <b>file2.o </b>and <b>file3.o</b>, $? represents <b>file2.o </b>and <b>file3.o</b>.

       $&lt;      In an inference rule, the $&lt; macro shall evaluate to the
               filename whose existence allowed the inference rule to be
               chosen for the target.  In the <b>.DEFAULT </b>rule, the $&lt; macro
               shall evaluate to the current target name. The meaning of the
               $&lt; macro shall be otherwise unspecified.

               For example, in the <b>.c.a </b>inference rule, $&lt; represents the
               prerequisite <b>.c </b>file.

       $*      The $* macro shall evaluate to the current target name with
               its suffix deleted. It shall be evaluated at least for
               inference rules.

               For example, in the <b>.c.a </b>inference rule, $*.o represents the
               out-of-date <b>.o </b>file that corresponds to the prerequisite <b>.c</b>
               file.

       Each of the internal macros has an alternative form. When an
       uppercase <b>'D' </b>or <b>'F' </b>is appended to any of the macros, the meaning
       shall be changed to the <i>directory part</i> for <b>'D' </b>and <i>filename part</i> for
       <b>'F'</b>.  The directory part is the path prefix of the file without a
       trailing &lt;slash&gt;; for the current directory, the directory part is
       <b>'.'</b>.  When the $? macro contains more than one prerequisite filename,
       the $(?D) and $(?F) (or ${?D} and ${?F}) macros expand to a list of
       directory name parts and filename parts respectively.

       For the target <i>lib</i>(<i>member</i><b>.o</b>) and the <b>s2.a </b>rule, the internal macros
       shall be defined as:

       $&lt;      <i>member</i><b>.s2</b>

       $*      <i>member</i>

       $@      <i>lib</i>

       $?      <i>member</i><b>.s2</b>

       $%      <i>member</i><b>.o</b>

   <b>Default Rules</b>
       The default rules for <i>make</i> shall achieve results that are the same as
       if the following were used.  Implementations that do not support the
       C-Language Development Utilities option may omit <b>CC</b>, <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>YACC</b>,
       <b>YFLAGS</b>, <b>LEX</b>, <b>LFLAGS</b>, <b>LDFLAGS</b>, and the <b>.c</b>, <b>.y</b>, and <b>.l </b>inference rules.
       Implementations that do not support FORTRAN may omit <b>FC</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b>, and
       the <b>.f </b>inference rules. Implementations may provide additional macros
       and rules.

       If there is a source file (such as <b>./source.c</b>) and there are two SCCS
       files corresponding to it (<b>./s.source.c </b>and <b>./SCCS/s.source.c</b>), on
       XSI-conformant systems <i>make</i> uses the SCCS file in the current
       directory. However, users are advised to use the underlying SCCS
       utilities (<i>admin</i>, <i>delta</i>, <i>get</i>, and so on) or the <i>sccs</i> utility for all
       source files in a given directory. If both forms are used for a given
       source file, future developers are very likely to be confused.

       It is incumbent upon portable makefiles to specify the <b>.POSIX </b>special
       target in order to guarantee that they are not affected by local
       extensions.

       The <b>−k </b>and <b>−S </b>options are both present so that the relationship
       between the command line, the <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> variable, and the makefile
       can be controlled precisely. If the <b>k </b>flag is passed in <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> and
       a command is of the form:

           <b>$(MAKE) −S foo</b>

       then the default behavior is restored for the child <i>make</i>.

       When the <b>−n </b>option is specified, it is always added to <i>MAKEFLAGS</i>.
       This allows a recursive <i>make</i> <b>−n </b><i>target</i> to be used to see all of the
       action that would be taken to update <i>target</i>.

       Because of widespread historical practice, interpreting a &lt;number-
       sign&gt; (<b>'#'</b>) inside a variable as the start of a comment has the
       unfortunate side-effect of making it impossible to place a &lt;number-
       sign&gt; in a variable, thus forbidding something like:

           <b>CFLAGS = "−D COMMENT_CHAR='#'"</b>

       Many historical <i>make</i> utilities stop chaining together inference rules
       when an intermediate target is nonexistent. For example, it might be
       possible for a <i>make</i> to determine that both <b>.y.c </b>and <b>.c.o </b>could be
       used to convert a <b>.y </b>to a <b>.o</b>.  Instead, in this case, <i>make</i> requires
       the use of a <b>.y.o </b>rule.

       The best way to provide portable makefiles is to include all of the
       rules needed in the makefile itself. The rules provided use only
       features provided by other parts of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008. The
       default rules include rules for optional commands in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008. Only rules pertaining to commands that are provided are
       needed in an implementation's default set.

       Macros used within other macros are evaluated when the new macro is
       used rather than when the new macro is defined. Therefore:

           <b>MACRO = </b><i>value1</i>
           <b>NEW   = $(MACRO)</b>
           <b>MACRO = </b><i>value2</i>

           target:
               echo $(NEW)

       would produce <i>value2</i> and not <i>value1</i> since <b>NEW </b>was not expanded until
       it was needed in the <i>echo</i> command line.

       Some historical applications have been known to intermix <i>target_name</i>
       and <i>macro=name</i> operands on the command line, expecting that all of
       the macros are processed before any of the targets are dealt with.
       Conforming applications do not do this, although some backwards-
       compatibility support may be included in some implementations.

       The following characters in filenames may give trouble: <b>'='</b>, <b>':'</b>,
       <b>'`'</b>, single-quote, and <b>'@'</b>.  In include filenames, pattern matching
       characters and <b>'"' </b>should also be avoided, as they may be treated as
       special by some implementations.

       For inference rules, the description of $&lt; and $? seem similar.
       However, an example shows the minor difference. In a makefile
       containing:

           <b>foo.o: foo.h</b>

       if <b>foo.h </b>is newer than <b>foo.o</b>, yet <b>foo.c </b>is older than <b>foo.o</b>, the
       built-in rule to make <b>foo.o </b>from <b>foo.c </b>is used, with $&lt; equal to
       <b>foo.c </b>and $? equal to <b>foo.h</b>.  If <b>foo.c </b>is also newer than <b>foo.o</b>, $&lt;
       is equal to <b>foo.c </b>and $? is equal to <b>foo.h foo.c</b>.

        1. The following command:

               <b>make</b>

           makes the first target found in the makefile.

        2. The following command:

               <b>make junk</b>

           makes the target <b>junk</b>.

        3. The following makefile says that <b>pgm </b>depends on two files, <b>a.o</b>
           and <b>b.o</b>, and that they in turn depend on their corresponding
           source files (<b>a.c </b>and <b>b.c</b>), and a common file <b>incl.h</b>:

               <b>pgm: a.o b.o</b>
                   <b>c99 a.o b.o −o pgm</b>
               <b>a.o: incl.h a.c</b>
                   <b>c99 −c a.c</b>
               <b>b.o: incl.h b.c</b>
                   <b>c99 −c b.c</b>

        4. An example for making optimized <b>.o </b>files from <b>.c </b>files is:

               <b>.c.o:</b>
                   <b>c99 −c −O $*.c</b>

           or:

               <b>.c.o:</b>
                   <b>c99 −c −O $&lt;</b>

        5. The most common use of the archive interface follows. Here, it is
           assumed that the source files are all C-language source:

               <b>lib: lib(file1.o) lib(file2.o) lib(file3.o)</b>
                   <b>@echo lib is now up-to-date</b>

           The <b>.c.a </b>rule is used to make <b>file1.o</b>, <b>file2.o</b>, and <b>file3.o </b>and
           insert them into <b>lib</b>.

           The treatment of escaped &lt;newline&gt; characters throughout the
           makefile is historical practice. For example, the inference rule:

               <b>.c.o\</b>
               <b>:</b>

           works, and the macro:

               <b>f=  bar baz\</b>
                   <b>biz</b>
               <b>a:</b>
                   <b>echo ==$f==</b>

           echoes <b>"==bar baz biz=="</b>.

           If $? were:

               <b>/usr/include/stdio.h /usr/include/unistd.h foo.h</b>

           then $(?D) would be:

               <b>/usr/include /usr/include .</b>

           and $(?F) would be:

               <b>stdio.h unistd.h foo.h</b>

        6. The contents of the built-in rules can be viewed by running:

               <b>make −p −f /dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null</b>

       Historically, the <i>make</i> utility has been an especially fertile ground
       for vendor and research organization-specific syntax modifications
       and extensions. Examples include:

        *  Syntax supporting parallel execution (such as from various multi-
           processor vendors, GNU, and others)

        *  Additional ``operators'' separating targets and their
           prerequisites (System V, BSD, and others)

        *  Specifying that command lines containing the strings <b>"${MAKE}"</b>
           and <b>"$(MAKE)" </b>are executed when the <b>−n </b>option is specified (GNU
           and System V)

        *  Modifications of the meaning of internal macros when referencing
           libraries (BSD and others)

        *  Using a single instance of the shell for all of the command lines
           of the target (BSD and others)

        *  Allowing &lt;space&gt; characters as well as &lt;tab&gt; characters to
           delimit command lines (BSD)

        *  Adding C preprocessor-style ``include'' and ``ifdef'' constructs
           (System V, GNU, BSD, and others)

        *  Remote execution of command lines (Sprite and others)

        *  Specifying additional special targets (BSD, System V, and most
           others)

       Additionally, many vendors and research organizations have rethought
       the basic concepts of <i>make</i>, creating vastly extended, as well as
       completely new, syntaxes. Each of these versions of <i>make</i> fulfills the
       needs of a different community of users; it is unreasonable for this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008 to require behavior that would be incompatible
       (and probably inferior) to historical practice for such a community.

       In similar circumstances, when the industry has enough sufficiently
       incompatible formats as to make them irreconcilable, this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 has followed one or both of two courses of action.
       Commands have been renamed (<i>cksum</i>, <i>echo</i>, and <i>pax</i>) and/or command line
       options have been provided to select the desired behavior (<i>grep</i>, <i>od</i>,
       and <i>pax</i>).

       Because the syntax specified for the <i>make</i> utility is, by and large, a
       subset of the syntaxes accepted by almost all versions of <i>make</i>, it
       was decided that it would be counter-productive to change the name.
       And since the makefile itself is a basic unit of portability, it
       would not be completely effective to reserve a new option letter,
       such as <i>make</i> <b>−P</b>, to achieve the portable behavior. Therefore, the
       special target <b>.POSIX </b>was added to the makefile, allowing users to
       specify ``standard'' behavior. This special target does not preclude
       extensions in the <i>make</i> utility, nor does it preclude such extensions
       being used by the makefile specifying the target; it does, however,
       preclude any extensions from being applied that could alter the
       behavior of previously valid syntax; such extensions must be
       controlled via command line options or new special targets. It is
       incumbent upon portable makefiles to specify the <b>.POSIX </b>special
       target in order to guarantee that they are not affected by local
       extensions.

       The portable version of <i>make</i> described in this reference page is not
       intended to be the state-of-the-art software generation tool and, as
       such, some newer and more leading-edge features have not been
       included. An attempt has been made to describe the portable makefile
       in a manner that does not preclude such extensions as long as they do
       not disturb the portable behavior described here.

       When the <b>−n </b>option is specified, it is always added to <i>MAKEFLAGS</i>.
       This allows a recursive <i>make</i> <b>−n </b><i>target</i> to be used to see all of the
       action that would be taken to update <i>target</i>.

       The definition of <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> allows both the System V letter string
       and the BSD command line formats. The two formats are sufficiently
       different to allow implementations to support both without ambiguity.

       Early proposals stated that an ``unquoted'' &lt;number-sign&gt; was treated
       as the start of a comment. The <i>make</i> utility does not pay any
       attention to quotes. A &lt;number-sign&gt; starts a comment regardless of
       its surroundings.

       The text about ``other implementation-defined pathnames may also be
       tried'' in addition to <b>./makefile </b>and <b>./Makefile </b>is to allow such
       extensions as <b>SCCS/s.Makefile </b>and other variations. It was made an
       implementation-defined requirement (as opposed to unspecified
       behavior) to highlight surprising implementations that might select
       something unexpected like <b>/etc/Makefile</b>.  XSI-conformant systems also
       try <b>./s.makefile</b>, <b>SCCS/s.makefile</b>, <b>./s.Makefile</b>, and <b>SCCS/s.Makefile</b>.

       Early proposals contained the macro <b>NPROC </b>as a means of specifying
       that <i>make</i> should use <i>n</i> processes to do the work required. While this
       feature is a valuable extension for many systems, it is not common
       usage and could require other non-trivial extensions to makefile
       syntax. This extension is not required by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, but could be provided as a compatible extension. The
       macro <b>PARALLEL </b>is used by some historical systems with essentially
       the same meaning (but without using a name that is a common system
       limit value). It is suggested that implementors recognize the
       existing use of <b>NPROC </b>and/or <b>PARALLEL </b>as extensions to <i>make</i>.

       The default rules are based on System V. The default <b>CC= </b>value is <i>c99</i>
       instead of <i>cc</i> because this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 does not
       standardize the utility named <i>cc</i>.  Thus, every conforming application
       would be required to define <b>CC=</b><i>c99</i> to expect to run. There is no
       advantage conferred by the hope that the makefile might hit the
       ``preferred'' compiler because this cannot be guaranteed to work.
       Also, since the portable makescript can only use the <i>c99</i> options, no
       advantage is conferred in terms of what the script can do.  It is a
       quality-of-implementation issue as to whether <i>c99</i> is as valuable as
       <i>cc</i>.

       The <b>−d </b>option to <i>make</i> is frequently used to produce debugging
       information, but is too implementation-defined to add to this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008.

       The <b>−p </b>option is not passed in <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> on most historical
       implementations and to change this would cause many implementations
       to break without sufficiently increased portability.

       Commands that begin with a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) are executed even if the
       <b>−n </b>option is present. Based on the GNU version of <i>make</i>, the behavior
       of <b>−n </b>when the &lt;plus-sign&gt; prefix is encountered has been extended to
       apply to <b>−q </b>and <b>−t </b>as well. However, the System V convention of
       forcing command execution with <b>−n </b>when the command line of a target
       contains either of the strings <b>"$(MAKE)" </b>or <b>"${MAKE}" </b>has not been
       adopted. This functionality appeared in early proposals, but the
       danger of this approach was pointed out with the following example of
       a portion of a makefile:

           <b>subdir:</b>
               <b>cd subdir; rm all_the_files; $(MAKE)</b>

       The loss of the System V behavior in this case is well-balanced by
       the safety afforded to other makefiles that were not aware of this
       situation. In any event, the command line &lt;plus-sign&gt; prefix can
       provide the desired functionality.

       The double &lt;colon&gt; in the target rule format is supported in BSD
       systems to allow more than one target line containing the same target
       name to have commands associated with it. Since this is not
       functionality described in the SVID or XPG3 it has been allowed as an
       extension, but not mandated.

       The default rules are provided with text specifying that the built-in
       rules shall be the same as if the listed set were used. The intent is
       that implementations should be able to use the rules without change,
       but will be allowed to alter them in ways that do not affect the
       primary behavior.

       The best way to provide portable makefiles is to include all of the
       rules needed in the makefile itself. The rules provided use only
       features provided by other portions of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008.
       The default rules include rules for optional commands in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008. Only rules pertaining to commands that are provided
       are needed in the default set of an implementation.

       One point of discussion was whether to drop the default rules list
       from this volume of POSIX.1‐2008. They provide convenience, but do
       not enhance portability of applications. The prime benefit is in
       portability of users who wish to type <i>make command</i> and have the
       command build from a <b>command.c </b>file.

       The historical <i>MAKESHELL</i> feature was omitted. In some implementations
       it is used to let a user override the shell to be used to run <i>make</i>
       commands. This was confusing; for a portable <i>make</i>, the shell should
       be chosen by the makefile writer or specified on the <i>make</i> command
       line and not by a user running <i>make</i>.

       The <i>make</i> utilities in most historical implementations process the
       prerequisites of a target in left-to-right order, and the makefile
       format requires this. It supports the standard idiom used in many
       makefiles that produce <i>yacc</i> programs; for example:

           <b>foo: y.tab.o lex.o main.o</b>
               <b>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) −o $</b>@ <b>t.tab.o lex.o main.o</b>

       In this example, if <i>make</i> chose any arbitrary order, the <b>lex.o </b>might
       not be made with the correct <b>y.tab.h</b>.  Although there may be better
       ways to express this relationship, it is widely used historically.
       Implementations that desire to update prerequisites in parallel
       should require an explicit extension to <i>make</i> or the makefile format
       to accomplish it, as described previously.

       The algorithm for determining a new entry for target rules is
       partially unspecified. Some historical <i>make</i>s allow blank, empty, or
       comment lines within the collection of commands marked by leading
       &lt;tab&gt; characters. A conforming makefile must ensure that each command
       starts with a &lt;tab&gt;, but implementations are free to ignore blank,
       empty, and comment lines without triggering the start of a new entry.

       The ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section includes having SIGTERM and SIGHUP,
       along with the more traditional SIGINT and SIGQUIT, remove the
       current target unless directed not to do so. SIGTERM and SIGHUP were
       added to parallel other utilities that have historically cleaned up
       their work as a result of these signals. When <i>make</i> receives any
       signal other than SIGQUIT, it is required to resend itself the signal
       it received so that it exits with a status that reflects the signal.
       The results from SIGQUIT are partially unspecified because, on
       systems that create <b>core </b>files upon receipt of SIGQUIT, the <b>core </b>from
       <i>make</i> would conflict with a <b>core </b>file from the command that was
       running when the SIGQUIT arrived. The main concern was to prevent
       damaged files from appearing up-to-date when <i>make</i> is rerun.

       The <b>.PRECIOUS </b>special target was extended to affect all targets
       globally (by specifying no prerequisites). The <b>.IGNORE </b>and <b>.SILENT</b>
       special targets were extended to allow prerequisites; it was judged
       to be more useful in some cases to be able to turn off errors or
       echoing for a list of targets than for the entire makefile. These
       extensions to <i>make</i> in System V were made to match historical practice
       from the BSD <i>make</i>.

       Macros are not exported to the environment of commands to be run.
       This was never the case in any historical <i>make</i> and would have serious
       consequences. The environment is the same as the environment to <i>make</i>
       except that <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> and macros defined on the <i>make</i> command line are
       added.

       Some implementations do not use <i>system</i>() for all command lines, as
       required by the portable makefile format; as a performance
       enhancement, they select lines without shell metacharacters for
       direct execution by <i>execve</i>().  There is no requirement that <i>system</i>()
       be used specifically, but merely that the same results be achieved.
       The metacharacters typically used to bypass the direct <i>execve</i>()
       execution have been any of:

           <b>=  |  ^  (  )  ;  &amp;  &lt;  &gt;  *  ?  [  ]  :  $  `  '  "  \  \n</b>

       The default in some advanced versions of <i>make</i> is to group all the
       command lines for a target and execute them using a single shell
       invocation; the System V method is to pass each line individually to
       a separate shell. The single-shell method has the advantages in
       performance and the lack of a requirement for many continued lines.
       However, converting to this newer method has caused portability
       problems with many historical makefiles, so the behavior with the
       POSIX makefile is specified to be the same as that of System V. It is
       suggested that the special target <b>.ONESHELL </b>be used as an
       implementation extension to achieve the single-shell grouping for a
       target or group of targets.

       Novice users of <i>make</i> have had difficulty with the historical need to
       start commands with a &lt;tab&gt;.  Since it is often difficult to discern
       differences between &lt;tab&gt; and &lt;space&gt; characters on terminals or
       printed listings, confusing bugs can arise. In early proposals, an
       attempt was made to correct this problem by allowing leading &lt;blank&gt;
       characters instead of &lt;tab&gt; characters. However, implementors
       reported many makefiles that failed in subtle ways following this
       change, and it is difficult to implement a <i>make</i> that unambiguously
       can differentiate between macro and command lines.  There is
       extensive historical practice of allowing leading &lt;space&gt; characters
       before macro definitions. Forcing macro lines into column 1 would be
       a significant backwards-compatibility problem for some makefiles.
       Therefore, historical practice was restored.

       There is substantial variation in the handling of include lines by
       different implementations. However, there is enough commonality for
       the standard to be able to specify a minimum set of requirements that
       allow the feature to be used portably. Known variations have been
       explicitly called out as unspecified behavior in the description.

       The System V dynamic dependency feature was not included. It would
       support:

           <b>cat: $$@.c</b>

       that would expand to;

           <b>cat: cat.c</b>

       This feature exists only in the new version of System V <i>make</i> and,
       while useful, is not in wide usage. This means that macros are
       expanded twice for prerequisites: once at makefile parse time and
       once at target update time.

       Consideration was given to adding metarules to the POSIX <i>make</i>.  This
       would make <b>%.o: %.c </b>the same as <b>.c.o:</b>.  This is quite useful and
       available from some vendors, but it would cause too many changes to
       this <i>make</i> to support. It would have introduced rule chaining and new
       substitution rules. However, the rules for target names have been set
       to reserve the <b>'%' </b>and <b>'"' </b>characters. These are traditionally used
       to implement metarules and quoting of target names, respectively.
       Implementors are strongly encouraged to use these characters only for
       these purposes.

       A request was made to extend the suffix delimiter character from a
       &lt;period&gt; to any character. The metarules feature in newer <i>make</i>s
       solves this problem in a more general way. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 is staying with the more conservative historical
       definition.

       The standard output format for the <b>−p </b>option is not described because
       it is primarily a debugging option and because the format is not
       generally useful to programs. In historical implementations the
       output is not suitable for use in generating makefiles. The <b>−p </b>format
       has been variable across historical implementations. Therefore, the
       definition of <b>−p </b>was only to provide a consistently named option for
       obtaining <i>make</i> script debugging information.

       Some historical implementations have not cleared the suffix list with
       <b>−r</b>.

       Implementations should be aware that some historical applications
       have intermixed <i>target_name</i> and <i>macro</i>=<i>value</i> operands on the command
       line, expecting that all of the macros are processed before any of
       the targets are dealt with. Conforming applications do not do this,
       but some backwards-compatibility support may be warranted.

       Empty inference rules are specified with a &lt;semicolon&gt; command rather
       than omitting all commands, as described in an early proposal. The
       latter case has no traditional meaning and is reserved for
       implementation extensions, such as in GNU <i>make</i>.
