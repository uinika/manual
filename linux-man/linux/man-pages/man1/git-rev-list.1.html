<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       List commits that are reachable by following the <b>parent </b>links from
       the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the
       one(s) given with a <i>^</i> in front of them. The output is given in
       reverse chronological order by default.

       You can think of this as a set operation. Commits given on the
       command line form a set of commits that are reachable from any of
       them, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with <i>^</i> in
       front are subtracted from that set. The remaining commits are what
       comes out in the command’s output. Various other options and paths
       parameters can be used to further limit the result.

       Thus, the following command:

                   $ git rev-list foo bar ^baz

       means "list all the commits which are reachable from <i>foo</i> or <i>bar</i>, but
       not from <i>baz</i>".

       A special notation "<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>..<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>" can be used as a short-hand
       for "^'&lt;commit1&gt;' <i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>". For example, either of the following
       may be used interchangeably:

                   $ git rev-list origin..HEAD
                   $ git rev-list HEAD ^origin

       Another special notation is "<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>...<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>" which is useful
       for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference
       between the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:

                   $ git rev-list A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
                   $ git rev-list A...B

       <i>rev-list</i> is a very essential Git command, since it provides the
       ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs. For this
       reason, it has a lot of different options that enables it to be used
       by commands as different as <i>git bisect</i> and <i>git repack</i>.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
   <b>Commit Limiting</b>
       Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the
       special notations explained in the description, additional commit
       limiting may be applied.

       Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
       <b>--since=&lt;date1&gt; </b>limits to commits newer than <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it
       with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt; </b>further limits to commits whose log message has
       a line that matches <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.

       Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
       options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.

       -&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;
           Limit the number of commits to output.

       --skip=&lt;number&gt;
           Skip <i>number</i> commits before starting to show the commit output.

       --since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

       --until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits older than a specific date.

       --max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;, --min-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;
           Limit the commits output to specified time range.

       --author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header
           lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression). With
           more than one <b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author matches
           any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
           <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).

       --grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match
           the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
           <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the
           given patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option
           unless <b>--walk-reflogs </b>is in use.

       --grep=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches
           the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
           <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches any of the given
           patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).

       --all-match
           Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <b>--grep</b>,
           instead of ones that match at least one.

       --invert-grep
           Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not
           match the pattern specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.

       -i, --regexp-ignore-case
           Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to
           letter case.

       --basic-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions;
           this is the default.

       -E, --extended-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions
           instead of the default basic regular expressions.

       -F, --fixed-strings
           Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don’t
           interpret pattern as a regular expression).

       -P, --perl-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular
           expressions.

           Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
           compile-time dependency. If Git wasn’t compiled with support for
           them providing this option will cause it to die.

       --remove-empty
           Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.

       --merges
           Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
           <b>--min-parents=2</b>.

       --no-merges
           Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly
           the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.

       --min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents,
       --no-max-parents
           Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many
           parent commits. In particular, <b>--max-parents=1 </b>is the same as
           <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2 </b>is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
           <b>--max-parents=0 </b>gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3 </b>all
           octopus merges.

           <b>--no-min-parents </b>and <b>--no-max-parents </b>reset these limits (to no
           limit) again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0 </b>(any commit
           has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1 </b>(negative numbers
           denote no upper limit).

       --first-parent
           Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit.
           This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution
           of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch
           tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to
           time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
           brought in to your history by such a merge. Cannot be combined
           with --bisect.

       --not
           Reverses the meaning of the <i>^</i> prefix (or lack thereof) for all
           following revision specifiers, up to the next <b>--not</b>.

       --all
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with <b>HEAD</b>, are listed
           on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.

       --branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads </b>are listed on the
           command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit branches
           to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>,
           <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags </b>are listed on the command
           line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit tags to ones
           matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the
           end is implied.

       --remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes </b>are listed on the
           command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit
           remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob. If
           pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> are
           listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading <i>refs/</i>, is
           automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>,
           <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Do not include refs matching <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> that the next <b>--all</b>,
           <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob </b>would otherwise
           consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion
           patterns up to the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or
           <b>--glob </b>option (other options or arguments do not clear
           accumulated patterns).

           The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>, <b>refs/tags</b>,
           or <b>refs/remotes </b>when applied to <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>,
           respectively, and they must begin with <b>refs/ </b>when applied to
           <b>--glob </b>or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing <i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given
           explicitly.

       --reflog
           Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the
           command line as <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.

       --ignore-missing
           Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if
           the bad input was not given.

       --stdin
           In addition to the <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the command line, read them
           from the standard input. If a <b>-- </b>separator is seen, stop reading
           commits and start reading paths to limit the result.

       --quiet
           Don’t print anything to standard output. This form is primarily
           meant to allow the caller to test the exit status to see if a
           range of objects is fully connected (or not). It is faster than
           redirecting stdout to <b>/dev/null </b>as the output does not have to be
           formatted.

       --cherry-mark
           Like <b>--cherry-pick </b>(see below) but mark equivalent commits with <b>=</b>
           rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with <b>+</b>.

       --cherry-pick
           Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit
           on the “other side” when the set of commits are limited with
           symmetric difference.

           For example, if you have two branches, <b>A </b>and <b>B</b>, a usual way to
           list all commits on only one side of them is with <b>--left-right</b>
           (see the example below in the description of the <b>--left-right</b>
           option). However, it shows the commits that were cherry-picked
           from the other branch (for example, “3rd on b” may be
           cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of
           commits are excluded from the output.

       --left-only, --right-only
           List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
           difference, i.e. only those which would be marked <b>&lt; </b>resp.  <b>&gt; </b>by
           <b>--left-right</b>.

           For example, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B </b>omits those commits
           from <b>B </b>which are in <b>A </b>or are patch-equivalent to a commit in <b>A</b>.
           In other words, this lists the <b>+ </b>commits from <b>git cherry A B</b>.
           More precisely, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only --no-merges </b>gives the
           exact list.

       --cherry
           A synonym for <b>--right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges</b>; useful to
           limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that
           have been applied to the other side of a forked history with <b>git</b>
           <b>log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git cherry upstream</b>
           <b>mybranch</b>.

       -g, --walk-reflogs
           Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries
           from the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used
           you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
           <i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i> notations cannot be
           used).

           With <b>--pretty </b>format other than <b>oneline </b>(for obvious reasons),
           this causes the output to have two extra lines of information
           taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be
           shown as <b>ref@{Nth} </b>(where <b>Nth </b>is the reverse-chronological index
           in the reflog) or as <b>ref@{timestamp} </b>(with the timestamp for that
           entry), depending on a few rules:

            1. If the starting point is specified as <b>ref@{Nth}</b>, show the
               index format.

            2. If the starting point was specified as <b>ref@{now}</b>, show the
               timestamp format.

            3. If neither was used, but <b>--date </b>was given on the command
               line, show the timestamp in the format requested by <b>--date</b>.

            4. Otherwise, show the index format.

           Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with this
           information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
           <b>--reverse</b>. See also <a href="git-reflog.1.html">git-reflog(1)</a>.

       --merge
           After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
           conflict and don’t exist on all heads to merge.

       --boundary
           Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are prefixed
           with <b>-</b>.

       --use-bitmap-index
           Try to speed up the traversal using the pack bitmap index (if one
           is available). Note that when traversing with <b>--objects</b>, trees
           and blobs will not have their associated path printed.

       --progress=&lt;header&gt;
           Show progress reports on stderr as objects are considered. The
           <b>&lt;header&gt; </b>text will be printed with each progress update.

   <b>History Simplification</b>
       Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for
       example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two
       parts of <i>History Simplification</i>, one part is selecting the commits
       and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to
       simplify the history.

       The following options select the commits to be shown:

       &lt;paths&gt;
           Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.

       --simplify-by-decoration
           Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.

       Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.

       The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:

       Default mode
           Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the
           final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side
           branches if the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches
           with the same content)

       --full-history
           Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.

       --dense
           Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
           meaningful history.

       --sparse
           All commits in the simplified history are shown.

       --simplify-merges
           Additional option to <b>--full-history </b>to remove some needless
           merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected
           commits contributing to this merge.

       --ancestry-path
           When given a range of commits to display (e.g.  <i>commit1..commit2</i>
           or <i>commit2 ^commit1</i>), only display commits that exist directly on
           the ancestry chain between the <i>commit1</i> and <i>commit2</i>, i.e. commits
           that are both descendants of <i>commit1</i>, and ancestors of <i>commit2</i>.

       A more detailed explanation follows.

       Suppose you specified <b>foo </b>as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that
       modify <b>foo </b>!TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for
       <b>foo</b>, they look different and equal, respectively.)

       In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to
       illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
       that you are filtering for a file <b>foo </b>in this commit graph:

                     .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                    /     /   /   /   /   /
                   I     B   C   D   E   Y
                    \   /   /   /   /   /
                     `-------------'   X

       The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent
       of each merge. The commits are:

       ·   <b>I </b>is the initial commit, in which <b>foo </b>exists with contents
           “asdf”, and a file <b>quux </b>exists with contents “quux”. Initial
           commits are compared to an empty tree, so <b>I </b>is !TREESAME.

       ·   In <b>A</b>, <b>foo </b>contains just “foo”.

       ·   <b>B </b>contains the same change as <b>A</b>. Its merge <b>M </b>is trivial and hence
           TREESAME to all parents.

       ·   <b>C </b>does not change <b>foo</b>, but its merge <b>N </b>changes it to “foobar”, so
           it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       ·   <b>D </b>sets <b>foo </b>to “baz”. Its merge <b>O </b>combines the strings from <b>N </b>and
           <b>D </b>to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       ·   <b>E </b>changes <b>quux </b>to “xyzzy”, and its merge <b>P </b>combines the strings
           to “quux xyzzy”.  <b>P </b>is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to <b>E</b>.

       ·   <b>X </b>is an independent root commit that added a new file <b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b>
           modified it.  <b>Y </b>is TREESAME to <b>X</b>. Its merge <b>Q </b>added <b>side </b>to <b>P</b>,
           and <b>Q </b>is TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to <b>Y</b>.

       <b>rev-list </b>walks backwards through history, including or excluding
       commits based on whether <b>--full-history </b>and/or parent rewriting (via
       <b>--parents </b>or <b>--children</b>) are used. The following settings are
       available.

       Default mode
           Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
           (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse </b>below). If the commit
           was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that
           parent. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only
           one of them.) Otherwise, follow all parents.

           This results in:

                         .-A---N---O
                        /     /   /
                       I---------D

           Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
           available, removed <b>B </b>from consideration entirely.  <b>C </b>was
           considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to
           an empty tree, so <b>I </b>is !TREESAME.

           Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but that
           does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have
           shown the parent lines.

       --full-history without parent rewriting
           This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow
           all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them.
           Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are
           included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the
           example, we get

                       I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q

           <b>M </b>was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  <b>E</b>, <b>C </b>and
           <b>B </b>were all walked, but only <b>B </b>was !TREESAME, so the others do not
           appear.

           Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to
           talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so
           we show them disconnected.

       --full-history with parent rewriting
           Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though
           this can be changed, see <b>--sparse </b>below).

           Merges are always included. However, their parent list is
           rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not
           included themselves. This results in

                         .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                        /     /   /   /   /
                       I     B   /   D   /
                        \   /   /   /   /
                         `-------------'

           Compare to <b>--full-history </b>without rewriting above. Note that <b>E</b>
           was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P
           was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for <b>C</b>
           and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y </b>and <b>Q</b>.

       In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
       affects inclusion:

       --dense
           Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to
           any parent.

       --sparse
           All commits that are walked are included.

           Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies merges:
           if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so
           the other sides of the merge are never walked.

       --simplify-merges
           First, build a history graph in the same way that <b>--full-history</b>
           with parent rewriting does (see above).

           Then simplify each commit <b>C </b>to its replacement <b>C' </b>in the final
           history according to the following rules:

           ·   Set <b>C' </b>to <b>C</b>.

           ·   Replace each parent <b>P </b>of <b>C' </b>with its simplification <b>P'</b>. In
               the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents
               or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and
               remove duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents
               that we are TREESAME to.

           ·   If after this parent rewriting, <b>C' </b>is a root or merge commit
               (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it
               remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.

           The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
           <b>--full-history </b>with parent rewriting. The example turns into:

                         .-A---M---N---O
                        /     /       /
                       I     B       D
                        \   /       /
                         `---------'

           Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q </b>over <b>--full-history</b>:

           ·   <b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I </b>removed, because it is an ancestor of
               the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N </b>remained because it is
               !TREESAME.

           ·   <b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I </b>removed.  <b>P </b>was then removed
               completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.

           ·   <b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y </b>simplified to <b>X</b>.  <b>X </b>was then removed,
               because it was a TREESAME root.  <b>Q </b>was then removed
               completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.

       Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:

       --ancestry-path
           Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry
           chain between the “from” and “to” commits in the given commit
           range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the “to”
           commit and descendants of the “from” commit.

           As an example use case, consider the following commit history:

                           D---E-------F
                          /     \       \
                         B---C---G---H---I---J
                        /                     \
                       A-------K---------------L--M

           A regular <i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of
           <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <b>D</b>. This is useful
           to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M </b>since <b>D</b>, in the
           sense that “what does <b>M </b>have that did not exist in <b>D</b>”. The result
           in this example would be all the commits, except <b>A </b>and <b>B </b>(and <b>D</b>
           itself, of course).

           When we want to find out what commits in <b>M </b>are contaminated with
           the bug introduced by <b>D </b>and need fixing, however, we might want
           to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are actually descendants of
           <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C </b>and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
           <b>--ancestry-path </b>option does. Applied to the <i>D..M</i> range, it
           results in:

                               E-------F
                                \       \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M

       The <b>--simplify-by-decoration </b>option allows you to view only the big
       picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are
       not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other
       words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if
       (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of
       the paths given on the command line. All other commits are marked as
       TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).

   <b>Bisection Helpers</b>
       --bisect
           Limit output to the one commit object which is roughly halfway
           between included and excluded commits. Note that the bad
           bisection ref <b>refs/bisect/bad </b>is added to the included commits
           (if it exists) and the good bisection refs <b>refs/bisect/good-* </b>are
           added to the excluded commits (if they exist). Thus, supposing
           there are no refs in <b>refs/bisect/</b>, if

                       $ git rev-list --bisect foo ^bar ^baz

           outputs <i>midpoint</i>, the output of the two commands

                       $ git rev-list foo ^midpoint
                       $ git rev-list midpoint ^bar ^baz

           would be of roughly the same length. Finding the change which
           introduces a regression is thus reduced to a binary search:
           repeatedly generate and test new 'midpoint’s until the commit
           chain is of length one. Cannot be combined with --first-parent.

       --bisect-vars
           This calculates the same as <b>--bisect</b>, except that refs in
           <b>refs/bisect/ </b>are not used, and except that this outputs text
           ready to be eval’ed by the shell. These lines will assign the
           name of the midpoint revision to the variable <b>bisect_rev</b>, and the
           expected number of commits to be tested after <b>bisect_rev </b>is
           tested to <b>bisect_nr</b>, the expected number of commits to be tested
           if <b>bisect_rev </b>turns out to be good to <b>bisect_good</b>, the expected
           number of commits to be tested if <b>bisect_rev </b>turns out to be bad
           to <b>bisect_bad</b>, and the number of commits we are bisecting right
           now to <b>bisect_all</b>.

       --bisect-all
           This outputs all the commit objects between the included and
           excluded commits, ordered by their distance to the included and
           excluded commits. Refs in <b>refs/bisect/ </b>are not used. The farthest
           from them is displayed first. (This is the only one displayed by
           <b>--bisect</b>.)

           This is useful because it makes it easy to choose a good commit
           to test when you want to avoid to test some of them for some
           reason (they may not compile for example).

           This option can be used along with <b>--bisect-vars</b>, in this case,
           after all the sorted commit objects, there will be the same text
           as if <b>--bisect-vars </b>had been used alone.

   <b>Commit Ordering</b>
       By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

       --date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
           otherwise show commits in the commit timestamp order.

       --author-date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
           otherwise show commits in the author timestamp order.

       --topo-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and avoid
           showing commits on multiple lines of history intermixed.

           For example, in a commit history like this:

                   ---1----2----4----7
                       \              \
                        3----5----6----8---

           where the numbers denote the order of commit timestamps, <b>git</b>
           <b>rev-list </b>and friends with <b>--date-order </b>show the commits in the
           timestamp order: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.

           With <b>--topo-order</b>, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6
           5 3 1); some older commits are shown before newer ones in order
           to avoid showing the commits from two parallel development track
           mixed together.

       --reverse
           Output the commits chosen to be shown (see Commit Limiting
           section above) in reverse order. Cannot be combined with
           <b>--walk-reflogs</b>.

   <b>Object Traversal</b>
       These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git repositories.

       --objects
           Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed
           commits.  <b>--objects foo ^bar </b>thus means “send me all object IDs
           which I need to download if I have the commit object <i>bar</i> but not
           <i>foo</i>”.

       --objects-edge
           Similar to <b>--objects</b>, but also print the IDs of excluded commits
           prefixed with a “-” character. This is used by
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> to build a “thin” pack, which records objects
           in deltified form based on objects contained in these excluded
           commits to reduce network traffic.

       --objects-edge-aggressive
           Similar to <b>--objects-edge</b>, but it tries harder to find excluded
           commits at the cost of increased time. This is used instead of
           <b>--objects-edge </b>to build “thin” packs for shallow repositories.

       --indexed-objects
           Pretend as if all trees and blobs used by the index are listed on
           the command line. Note that you probably want to use <b>--objects</b>,
           too.

       --unpacked
           Only useful with <b>--objects</b>; print the object IDs that are not in
           packs.

       --no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]
           Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their ancestors.
           This has no effect if a range is specified. If the argument
           <b>unsorted </b>is given, the commits are shown in the order they were
           given on the command line. Otherwise (if <b>sorted </b>or no argument
           was given), the commits are shown in reverse chronological order
           by commit time. Cannot be combined with <b>--graph</b>.

       --do-walk
           Overrides a previous <b>--no-walk</b>.

   <b>Commit Formatting</b>
       Using these options, <a href="git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list(1)</a> will act similar to the more
       specialized family of commit log tools: <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and
       <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>

       --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;
           Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format,
           where <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be one of <i>oneline</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>, <i>full</i>,
           <i>fuller</i>, <i>email</i>, <i>raw</i>, <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> and <i>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</i>. When
           <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> is none of the above, and has <i>%placeholder</i> in it, it
           acts as if <i>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</i> were given.

           See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for
           each format. When <i>=&lt;format&gt;</i> part is omitted, it defaults to
           <i>medium</i>.

           Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
           configuration (see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>).

       --abbrev-commit
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object
           name, show only a partial prefix. Non default number of digits
           can be specified with "--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;" (which also modifies diff
           output, if it is displayed).

           This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for
           people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
           Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This
           negates <b>--abbrev-commit </b>and those options which imply it such as
           "--oneline". It also overrides the <b>log.abbrevCommit </b>variable.

       --oneline
           This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used
           together.

       --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
           The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message
           in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
           command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding
           preferred by the user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to
           UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to be encoded in <b>X </b>and we
           are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will output the object verbatim; this
           means that invalid sequences in the original commit may be copied
           to the output.

       --expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs
           Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to
           fill to the next display column that is multiple of <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>) in the
           log message before showing it in the output.  <b>--expand-tabs </b>is a
           short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and <b>--no-expand-tabs </b>is a
           short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which disables tab expansion.

           By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the
           log message by 4 spaces (i.e.  <i>medium</i>, which is the default,
           <i>full</i>, and <i>fuller</i>).

       --show-signature
           Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the
           signature to <b>gpg --verify </b>and show the output.

       --relative-date
           Synonym for <b>--date=relative</b>.

       --date=&lt;format&gt;
           Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such
           as when using <b>--pretty</b>.  <b>log.date </b>config variable sets a default
           value for the log command’s <b>--date </b>option. By default, dates are
           shown in the original time zone (either committer’s or author’s).
           If <b>-local </b>is appended to the format (e.g., <b>iso-local</b>), the user’s
           local time zone is used instead.

           <b>--date=relative </b>shows dates relative to the current time, e.g. “2
           hours ago”. The <b>-local </b>option has no effect for <b>--date=relative</b>.

           <b>--date=local </b>is an alias for <b>--date=default-local</b>.

           <b>--date=iso </b>(or <b>--date=iso8601</b>) shows timestamps in a ISO
           8601-like format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format
           are:

           ·   a space instead of the <b>T </b>date/time delimiter

           ·   a space between time and time zone

           ·   no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone

           <b>--date=iso-strict </b>(or <b>--date=iso8601-strict</b>) shows timestamps in
           strict ISO 8601 format.

           <b>--date=rfc </b>(or <b>--date=rfc2822</b>) shows timestamps in RFC 2822
           format, often found in email messages.

           <b>--date=short </b>shows only the date, but not the time, in <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>
           format.

           <b>--date=raw </b>shows the date as seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01
           00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an
           offset from UTC (a <b>+ </b>or <b>- </b>with four digits; the first two are
           hours, and the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp
           were formatted with <b>strftime("%s %z")</b>). Note that the <b>-local</b>
           option does not affect the seconds-since-epoch value (which is
           always measured in UTC), but does switch the accompanying
           timezone value.

           <b>--date=unix </b>shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds
           since 1970). As with <b>--raw</b>, this is always in UTC and therefore
           <b>-local </b>has no effect.

           <b>--date=format:...  </b>feeds the format <b>...  </b>to your system <b>strftime</b>,
           except for %z and %Z, which are handled internally. Use
           <b>--date=format:%c </b>to show the date in your system locale’s
           preferred format. See the <b>strftime </b>manual for a complete list of
           format placeholders. When using <b>-local</b>, the correct syntax is
           <b>--date=format-local:...</b>.

           <b>--date=default </b>is the default format, and is similar to
           <b>--date=rfc2822</b>, with a few exceptions:

           ·   there is no comma after the day-of-week

           ·   the time zone is omitted when the local time zone is used

       --header
           Print the contents of the commit in raw-format; each record is
           separated with a NUL character.

       --parents
           Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit
           parent..."). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History</i>
           <i>Simplification</i> below.

       --children
           Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit
           child..."). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History</i>
           <i>Simplification</i> below.

       --timestamp
           Print the raw commit timestamp.

       --left-right
           Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is reachable
           from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with <b>&lt; </b>and those
           from the right with <b>&gt;</b>. If combined with <b>--boundary</b>, those commits
           are prefixed with <b>-</b>.

           For example, if you have this topology:

                            y---b---b  branch B
                           / \ /
                          /   .
                         /   / \
                        o---x---a---a  branch A

           you would get an output like this:

                       $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
                       -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
                       -xxxxxxx... 1st on a

       --graph
           Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history
           on the left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines
           to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history
           to be drawn properly. Cannot be combined with <b>--no-walk</b>.

           This enables parent rewriting, see <i>History Simplification</i> below.

           This implies the <b>--topo-order </b>option by default, but the
           <b>--date-order </b>option may also be specified.

       --show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]
           When --graph is not used, all history branches are flattened
           which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do
           not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a barrier in
           between them in that case. If <b>&lt;barrier&gt; </b>is specified, it is the
           string that will be shown instead of the default one.

       --count
           Print a number stating how many commits would have been listed,
           and suppress all other output. When used together with
           <b>--left-right</b>, instead print the counts for left and right
           commits, separated by a tab. When used together with
           <b>--cherry-mark</b>, omit patch equivalent commits from these counts
           and print the count for equivalent commits separated by a tab.

<h2><a id="PRETTY_FORMATS" href="#PRETTY_FORMATS"></a>PRETTY FORMATS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not <i>oneline</i>,
       <i>email</i> or <i>raw</i>, an additional line is inserted before the <i>Author:</i> line.
       This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits
       are printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits may
       not necessarily be the list of the <b>direct </b>parent commits if you have
       limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested
       in changes related to a certain directory or file.

       There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
       formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another
       format name, or a <i>format:</i> string, as described below (see
       <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>). Here are the details of the built-in formats:

       ·   <i>oneline</i>

               &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;title line&gt;

           This is designed to be as compact as possible.

       ·   <i>short</i>

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

       ·   <i>medium</i>

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Date:   &lt;author date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       ·   <i>full</i>

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Commit: &lt;committer&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       ·   <i>fuller</i>

               commit &lt;sha1&gt;
               Author:     &lt;author&gt;
               AuthorDate: &lt;author date&gt;
               Commit:     &lt;committer&gt;
               CommitDate: &lt;committer date&gt;

               &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       ·   <i>email</i>

               From &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;date&gt;
               From: &lt;author&gt;
               Date: &lt;author date&gt;
               Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title line&gt;

               &lt;full commit message&gt;

       ·   <i>raw</i>

           The <i>raw</i> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the
           commit object. Notably, the SHA-1s are displayed in full,
           regardless of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and
           <i>parents</i> information show the true parent commits, without taking
           grafts or history simplification into account. Note that this
           format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the
           diff is shown e.g. with <b>git log --raw</b>. To get full object names
           in a raw diff format, use <b>--no-abbrev</b>.

       ·   <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i>

           The <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> format allows you to specify which
           information you want to show. It works a little bit like printf
           format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with <i>%n</i>
           instead of <i>\n</i>.

           E.g, <i>format:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was</i>
           <i>&gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n"</i> would show something like this:

               The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
               The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;

           The placeholders are:

           ·   <i>%H</i>: commit hash

           ·   <i>%h</i>: abbreviated commit hash

           ·   <i>%T</i>: tree hash

           ·   <i>%t</i>: abbreviated tree hash

           ·   <i>%P</i>: parent hashes

           ·   <i>%p</i>: abbreviated parent hashes

           ·   <i>%an</i>: author name

           ·   <i>%aN</i>: author name (respecting .mailmap, see <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> or
               <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%ae</i>: author email

           ·   <i>%aE</i>: author email (respecting .mailmap, see <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a>
               or <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%ad</i>: author date (format respects --date= option)

           ·   <i>%aD</i>: author date, RFC2822 style

           ·   <i>%ar</i>: author date, relative

           ·   <i>%at</i>: author date, UNIX timestamp

           ·   <i>%ai</i>: author date, ISO 8601-like format

           ·   <i>%aI</i>: author date, strict ISO 8601 format

           ·   <i>%cn</i>: committer name

           ·   <i>%cN</i>: committer name (respecting .mailmap, see <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a>
               or <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%ce</i>: committer email

           ·   <i>%cE</i>: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see
               <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> or <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%cd</i>: committer date (format respects --date= option)

           ·   <i>%cD</i>: committer date, RFC2822 style

           ·   <i>%cr</i>: committer date, relative

           ·   <i>%ct</i>: committer date, UNIX timestamp

           ·   <i>%ci</i>: committer date, ISO 8601-like format

           ·   <i>%cI</i>: committer date, strict ISO 8601 format

           ·   <i>%d</i>: ref names, like the --decorate option of <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>

           ·   <i>%D</i>: ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.

           ·   <i>%e</i>: encoding

           ·   <i>%s</i>: subject

           ·   <i>%f</i>: sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename

           ·   <i>%b</i>: body

           ·   <i>%B</i>: raw body (unwrapped subject and body)

           ·   <i>%GG</i>: raw verification message from GPG for a signed commit

           ·   <i>%G?</i>: show "G" for a good (valid) signature, "B" for a bad
               signature, "U" for a good signature with unknown validity,
               "X" for a good signature that has expired, "Y" for a good
               signature made by an expired key, "R" for a good signature
               made by a revoked key, "E" if the signature cannot be checked
               (e.g. missing key) and "N" for no signature

           ·   <i>%GS</i>: show the name of the signer for a signed commit

           ·   <i>%GK</i>: show the key used to sign a signed commit

           ·   <i>%gD</i>: reflog selector, e.g., <b>refs/stash@{1} </b>or <b>refs/stash@{2</b>
               <b>minutes ago</b>}; the format follows the rules described for the
               <b>-g </b>option. The portion before the <b>@ </b>is the refname as given
               on the command line (so <b>git log -g refs/heads/master </b>would
               yield <b>refs/heads/master@{0}</b>).

           ·   <i>%gd</i>: shortened reflog selector; same as <b>%gD</b>, but the refname
               portion is shortened for human readability (so
               <b>refs/heads/master </b>becomes just <b>master</b>).

           ·   <i>%gn</i>: reflog identity name

           ·   <i>%gN</i>: reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see
               <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> or <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%ge</i>: reflog identity email

           ·   <i>%gE</i>: reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see
               <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> or <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>)

           ·   <i>%gs</i>: reflog subject

           ·   <i>%Cred</i>: switch color to red

           ·   <i>%Cgreen</i>: switch color to green

           ·   <i>%Cblue</i>: switch color to blue

           ·   <i>%Creset</i>: reset color

           ·   <i>%C(...)</i>: color specification, as described under Values in
               the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>; adding
               <b>auto, </b>at the beginning (e.g.  <b>%C(auto,red)</b>) will emit color
               only when colors are enabled for log output (by <b>color.diff</b>,
               <b>color.ui</b>, or <b>--color</b>, and respecting the <b>auto </b>settings of the
               former if we are going to a terminal).  <b>auto </b>alone (i.e.
               <b>%C(auto)</b>) will turn on auto coloring on the next placeholders
               until the color is switched again.

           ·   <i>%m</i>: left (<b>&lt;</b>), right (<b>&gt;</b>) or boundary (<b>-</b>) mark

           ·   <i>%n</i>: newline

           ·   <i>%%</i>: a raw <i>%</i>

           ·   <i>%x00</i>: print a byte from a hex code

           ·   <i>%w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]])</i>: switch line wrapping, like the -w
               option of <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a>.

           ·   <i>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])</i>: make the next placeholder take
               at least N columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary.
               Optionally truncate at the beginning (ltrunc), the middle
               (mtrunc) or the end (trunc) if the output is longer than N
               columns. Note that truncating only works correctly with N &gt;=
               2.

           ·   <i>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>: make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
               columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary

           ·   <i>%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>: similar to <i>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i> respectively,
               but padding spaces on the left

           ·   <i>%&gt;&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>: similar to <i>%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>
               respectively, except that if the next placeholder takes more
               spaces than given and there are spaces on its left, use those
               spaces

           ·   <i>%&gt;&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>: similar to <i>% &lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i>
               respectively, but padding both sides (i.e. the text is
               centered)

           ·   %(trailers): display the trailers of the body as interpreted
               by <a href="git-interpret-trailers.1.html">git-interpret-trailers(1)</a>

           <b>Note</b>
           Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
           revision traversal engine. For example, the <b>%g* </b>reflog options
           will insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog
           entries (e.g., by <b>git log -g</b>). The <b>%d </b>and <b>%D </b>placeholders will
           use the "short" decoration format if <b>--decorate </b>was not already
           provided on the command line.

       If you add a <b>+ </b>(plus sign) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, a line-feed is
       inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
       placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

       If you add a <b>- </b>(minus sign) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, all consecutive
       line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion are deleted if and
       only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.

       If you add a ` ` (space) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, a space is
       inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
       placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

       ·   <i>tformat:</i>

           The <i>tformat:</i> format works exactly like <i>format:</i>, except that it
           provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics.
           In other words, each commit has the message terminator character
           (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed
           between entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line
           format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
           "oneline" format does. For example:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
               4da45be
               7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
               4da45be
               7134973

           In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <b>% </b>in it is
           interpreted as if it has <b>tformat: </b>in front of it. For example,
           these two are equivalent:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
               $ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
