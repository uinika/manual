       The <i>find</i> utility shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy
       from each file specified by <i>path</i>, evaluating a Boolean expression
       composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for each
       file encountered. Each <i>path</i> operand shall be evaluated unaltered as
       it was provided, including all trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters; all
       pathnames for other files encountered in the hierarchy shall consist
       of the concatenation of the current <i>path</i> operand, a &lt;slash&gt; if the
       current <i>path</i> operand did not end in one, and the filename relative to
       the <i>path</i> operand. The relative portion shall contain no dot or dot-
       dot components, no trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters, and only single
       &lt;slash&gt; characters between pathname components.

       The <i>find</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a
       file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length limitations
       (unless a <i>path</i> operand specified by the application exceeds
       {PATH_MAX} requirements).

       The <i>find</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <i>find</i> shall write a
       diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its
       position in the hierarchy or terminate.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy being
       searched it is unspecified whether or not <i>find</i> includes that file in
       its search.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>find</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>−H        </b>Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each
                 symbolic link encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the command
                 line to be those of the file referenced by the link, and
                 not the link itself. If the referenced file does not exist,
                 the file information and type shall be for the link itself.
                 File information and type for symbolic links encountered
                 during the traversal of a file hierarchy shall be that of
                 the link itself.

       <b>−L        </b>Cause the file information and file type evaluated for each
                 symbolic link encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the command
                 line or encountered during the traversal of a file
                 hierarchy to be those of the file referenced by the link,
                 and not the link itself. If the referenced file does not
                 exist, the file information and type shall be for the link
                 itself.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>−H </b>and <b>−L</b>
       shall not be considered an error. The last option specified shall
       determine the behavior of the utility. If neither the <b>−H </b>nor the <b>−L</b>
       option is specified, then the file information and type for symbolic
       links encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the command line or
       encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy shall be that of
       the link itself.

       The following operands shall be supported:

       The first operand and subsequent operands up to but not including the
       first operand that starts with a <b>'−'</b>, or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>, shall be
       interpreted as <i>path</i> operands. If the first operand starts with a <b>'−'</b>,
       or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>, the behavior is unspecified. Each <i>path</i> operand
       is a pathname of a starting point in the file hierarchy.

       The first operand that starts with a <b>'−'</b>, or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>, and
       all subsequent arguments shall be interpreted as an <i>expression</i> made
       up of the following primaries and operators. In the descriptions,
       wherever <i>n</i> is used as a primary argument, it shall be interpreted as
       a decimal integer optionally preceded by a plus (<b>'+'</b>) or minus-sign
       (<b>'−'</b>) sign, as follows:

       +<i>n</i>        More than <i>n</i>.

       <i>n</i>         Exactly <i>n</i>.

       −<i>n</i>        Less than <i>n</i>.

       The following primaries shall be supported:

       <b>−name </b><i>pattern</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of the
                 current pathname matches <i>pattern</i> using the pattern matching
                 notation described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching</i>
                 <i>Notation</i>.  The additional rules in <i>Section 2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns</i>
                 <i>Used for Filename Expansion</i> do not apply as this is a
                 matching operation, not an expansion.

       <b>−path </b><i>pattern</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the current pathname
                 matches <i>pattern</i> using the pattern matching notation
                 described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching Notation</i>.  The
                 additional rules in <i>Section 2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns Used for</i>
                 <i>Filename Expansion</i> do not apply as this is a matching
                 operation, not an expansion.

       <b>−nouser   </b>The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a
                 user ID for which the <i>getpwuid</i>() function defined in the
                 System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 (or equivalent)
                 returns NULL.

       <b>−nogroup  </b>The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to a
                 group ID for which the <i>getgrgid</i>() function defined in the
                 System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 (or equivalent)
                 returns NULL.

       <b>−xdev     </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause
                 <i>find</i> not to continue descending past directories that have
                 a different device ID (<i>st_dev</i>, see the <i>stat</i>() function
                 defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008).
                 If any <b>−xdev </b>primary is specified, it shall apply to the
                 entire expression even if the <b>−xdev </b>primary would not
                 normally be evaluated.

       <b>−prune    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause
                 <i>find</i> not to descend the current pathname if it is a
                 directory. If the <b>−depth </b>primary is specified, the <b>−prune</b>
                 primary shall have no effect.

       <b>−perm [−]</b><i>mode</i>
                 The <i>mode</i> argument is used to represent file mode bits. It
                 shall be identical in format to the <i>symbolic_mode</i> operand
                 described in <i>chmod</i>, and shall be interpreted as follows. To
                 start, a template shall be assumed with all file mode bits
                 cleared. An <i>op</i> symbol of <b>'+' </b>shall set the appropriate mode
                 bits in the template; <b>'−' </b>shall clear the appropriate bits;
                 <b>'=' </b>shall set the appropriate mode bits, without regard to
                 the contents of the file mode creation mask of the process.
                 The <i>op</i> symbol of <b>'−' </b>cannot be the first character of <i>mode</i>;
                 this avoids ambiguity with the optional leading &lt;hyphen&gt;.
                 Since the initial mode is all bits off, there are not any
                 symbolic modes that need to use <b>'−' </b>as the first character.

                 If the &lt;hyphen&gt; is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as
                 true when the file permission bits exactly match the value
                 of the resulting template.

                 Otherwise, if <i>mode</i> is prefixed by a &lt;hyphen&gt;, the primary
                 shall evaluate as true if at least all the bits in the
                 resulting template are set in the file permission bits.

       <b>−perm [−]</b><i>onum</i>
                 If the &lt;hyphen&gt; is omitted, the primary shall evaluate as
                 true when the file mode bits exactly match the value of the
                 octal number <i>onum</i> (see the description of the octal <i>mode</i> in
                 <i>chmod</i>).  Otherwise, if <i>onum</i> is prefixed by a &lt;hyphen&gt;, the
                 primary shall evaluate as true if at least all of the bits
                 specified in <i>onum</i> are set. In both cases, the behavior is
                 unspecified when <i>onum</i> exceeds 07777.

       <b>−type </b><i>c</i>   The primary shall evaluate as true if the type of the file
                 is <i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> is <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>'l'</b>, <b>'p'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, or <b>'s' </b>for
                 block special file, character special file, directory,
                 symbolic link, FIFO, regular file, or socket, respectively.

       <b>−links </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file has <i>n</i> links.

       <b>−user </b><i>uname</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to
                 the user <i>uname.</i>  If <i>uname</i> is a decimal integer and the
                 <i>getpwnam</i>() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid
                 user name, <i>uname</i> shall be interpreted as a user ID.

       <b>−group </b><i>gname</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to
                 the group <i>gname</i>.  If <i>gname</i> is a decimal integer and the
                 <i>getgrnam</i>() (or equivalent) function does not return a valid
                 group name, <i>gname</i> shall be interpreted as a group ID.

       <b>−size </b><i>n</i><b>[c]</b>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in
                 bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up to the next integer,
                 is <i>n</i>.  If <i>n</i> is followed by the character <b>'c'</b>, the size
                 shall be in bytes.

       <b>−atime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file access time
                 subtracted from the initialization time, divided by 86400
                 (with any remainder discarded), is <i>n</i>.

       <b>−ctime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the time of last
                 change of file status information subtracted from the
                 initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder
                 discarded), is <i>n</i>.

       <b>−mtime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file modification
                 time subtracted from the initialization time, divided by
                 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <i>n</i>.

       <b>−exec </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>] ;</b>

       <b>−exec </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>]  </b>{} +
                 The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by a
                 &lt;semicolon&gt; or by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;.  Only a &lt;plus-sign&gt; that
                 immediately follows an argument containing only the two
                 characters <b>"{}" </b>shall punctuate the end of the primary
                 expression. Other uses of the &lt;plus-sign&gt; shall not be
                 treated as special.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a &lt;semicolon&gt;,
                 the utility <i>utility_name</i> shall be invoked once for each
                 pathname and the primary shall evaluate as true if the
                 utility returns a zero value as exit status. A <i>utility_name</i>
                 or <i>argument</i> containing only the two characters <b>"{}" </b>shall
                 be replaced by the current pathname. If a <i>utility_name</i> or
                 <i>argument</i> string contains the two characters <b>"{}"</b>, but not
                 just the two characters <b>"{}"</b>, it is implementation-defined
                 whether <i>find</i> replaces those two characters or uses the
                 string without change.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;,
                 the primary shall always evaluate as true, and the
                 pathnames for which the primary is evaluated shall be
                 aggregated into sets. The utility <i>utility_name</i> shall be
                 invoked once for each set of aggregated pathnames. Each
                 invocation shall begin after the last pathname in the set
                 is aggregated, and shall be completed before the <i>find</i>
                 utility exits and before the first pathname in the next set
                 (if any) is aggregated for this primary, but it is
                 otherwise unspecified whether the invocation occurs before,
                 during, or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any
                 invocation returns a non-zero value as exit status, the
                 <i>find</i> utility shall return a non-zero exit status. An
                 argument containing only the two characters <b>"{}" </b>shall be
                 replaced by the set of aggregated pathnames, with each
                 pathname passed as a separate argument to the invoked
                 utility in the same order that it was aggregated. The size
                 of any set of two or more pathnames shall be limited such
                 that execution of the utility does not cause the system's
                 {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than one argument
                 containing the two characters <b>"{}" </b>is present, the behavior
                 is unspecified.

                 The current directory for the invocation of <i>utility_name</i>
                 shall be the same as the current directory when the <i>find</i>
                 utility was started. If the <i>utility_name</i> names any of the
                 special built-in utilities (see <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>Special</i>
                 <i>Built-In Utilities</i>), the results are undefined.

       <b>−ok </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>] ;</b>
                 The <b>−ok </b>primary shall be equivalent to <b>−exec</b>, except that
                 the use of a &lt;plus-sign&gt; to punctuate the end of the
                 primary expression need not be supported, and <i>find</i> shall
                 request affirmation of the invocation of <i>utility_name</i> using
                 the current file as an argument by writing to standard
                 error as described in the STDERR section. If the response
                 on standard input is affirmative, the utility shall be
                 invoked. Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and
                 the value of the <b>−ok </b>operand shall be false.

       <b>−print    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause
                 the current pathname to be written to standard output.

       <b>−newer </b><i>file</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification time
                 of the current file is more recent than the modification
                 time of the file named by the pathname <i>file</i>.

       <b>−depth    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall cause
                 descent of the directory hierarchy to be done so that all
                 entries in a directory are acted on before the directory
                 itself. If a <b>−depth </b>primary is not specified, all entries
                 in a directory shall be acted on after the directory
                 itself. If any <b>−depth </b>primary is specified, it shall apply
                 to the entire expression even if the <b>−depth </b>primary would
                 not normally be evaluated.

       The primaries can be combined using the following operators (in order
       of decreasing precedence):

       ( <i>expression</i> )
                 True if <i>expression</i> is true.

       <b>! </b><i>expression</i>
                 Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.

       <i>expression</i> <b>[−a] </b><i>expression</i>
                 Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied by
                 the juxtaposition of two primaries or made explicit by the
                 optional <b>−a </b>operator. The second expression shall not be
                 evaluated if the first expression is false.

       <i>expression</i> <b>−o </b><i>expression</i>
                 Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second
                 expression shall not be evaluated if the first expression
                 is true.

       If no <i>expression</i> is present, <b>−print </b>shall be used as the expression.
       Otherwise, if the given expression does not contain any of the
       primaries <b>−exec</b>, <b>−ok</b>, or <b>−print</b>, the given expression shall be
       effectively replaced by:

           <b>( </b><i>given_expression</i> <b>) −print</b>

       The <b>−user</b>, <b>−group</b>, and <b>−newer </b>primaries each shall evaluate their
       respective arguments only once.

       When the file type evaluated for the current file is a symbolic link,
       the results of evaluating the <b>−perm </b>primary are implementation-
       defined.

       The bit that is traditionally used for sticky (historically 01000) is
       specified in the <b>−perm </b>primary using the octal number argument form.
       Since this bit is not defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008,
       applications must not assume that it actually refers to the
       traditional sticky bit.

<h2><a id="EXAMPLES" href="#EXAMPLES"></a>EXAMPLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
        1. The following commands are equivalent:

               <b>find .</b>
               <b>find . −print</b>

           They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from the
           current directory.

        2. The following command:

               <b>find / \( −name tmp −o −name '*.xx' \) −atime +7 −exec rm {} \;</b>

           removes all files named <b>tmp </b>or ending in <b>.xx </b>that have not been
           accessed for seven or more 24-hour periods.

        3. The following command:

               <b>find . −perm −o+w,+s</b>

           prints (<b>−print </b>is assumed) the names of all files in or below the
           current directory, with all of the file permission bits S_ISUID,
           S_ISGID, and S_IWOTH set.

        4. The following command:

               <b>find . −name SCCS −prune −o −print</b>

           recursively prints pathnames of all files in the current
           directory and below, but skips directories named SCCS and files
           in them.

        5. The following command:

               <b>find . −print −name SCCS −prune</b>

           behaves as in the previous example, but prints the names of the
           SCCS directories.

        6. The following command is roughly equivalent to the <b>−nt </b>extension
           to <i>test</i>:

               <b>if [ −n "$(find file1 −prune −newer file2)" ]; then</b>
                   <b>printf %s\\n "file1 is newer than file2"</b>
               <b>fi</b>

        7. The descriptions of <b>−atime</b>, <b>−ctime</b>, and <b>−mtime </b>use the
           terminology <i>n</i> ``86400 second periods (days)''. For example, a
           file accessed at 23:59 is selected by:

               <b>find . −atime −1 −print</b>

           at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours later, not more than
           one day ago); the midnight boundary between days has no effect on
           the 24-hour calculation.

        8. The following command:

               <b>find . ! −name . −prune −name '*.old' −exec \</b>
                   <b>sh −c 'mv "$@" ../old/' sh {} +</b>

           performs the same task as:

               <b>mv ./*.old ./.old ./.*.old ../old/</b>

           while avoiding an ``Argument list too long'' error if there are a
           large number of files ending with <b>.old </b>and without running <i>mv</i> if
           there are no such files (and avoiding ``No such file or
           directory'' errors if <b>./.old </b>does not exist or no files match
           <b>./*.old </b>or <b>./.*.old</b>).

           The alternative:

               <b>find . ! −name . −prune −name '*.old' −exec mv {} ../old/ \;</b>

           is less efficient if there are many files to move because it
           executes one <i>mv</i> command per file.

        9. On systems configured to mount removable media on directories
           under <b>/media</b>, the following command searches the file hierarchy
           for files larger than 100000 KB without searching any mounted
           removable media:

               <b>find / −path /media −prune −o −size +200000 −print</b>

       10. Except for the root directory, and <b>"//" </b>on implementations where
           <b>"//" </b>does not refer to the root directory, no pattern given to
           <b>−name </b>will match a &lt;slash&gt;, because trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters
           are ignored when computing the basename of the file under
           evaluation. Given two empty directories named <b>foo </b>and <b>bar</b>, the
           following command:

               <b>find foo/// bar/// −name foo −o −name 'bar?*'</b>

           prints only the line <b>"foo///"</b>.

       The <b>−a </b>operator was retained as an optional operator for
       compatibility with historical shell scripts, even though it is
       redundant with expression concatenation.

       The descriptions of the <b>'−' </b>modifier on the <i>mode</i> and <i>onum</i> arguments
       to the <b>−perm </b>primary agree with historical practice on BSD and System
       V implementations. System V and BSD documentation both describe it in
       terms of checking additional bits; in fact, it uses the same bits,
       but checks for having at least all of the matching bits set instead
       of having exactly the matching bits set.

       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the
       general nature of the contents of prompts are specified because:

        *  Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those
           used on historical implementations.

        *  Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate with
           &lt;newline&gt; characters, there is no portable way for another
           program to interact with the prompts of this utility via pipes.

       Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on the
       system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user,
       based on the general guidelines specified.

       The <b>−name </b><i>file</i> operand was changed to use the shell pattern matching
       notation so that <i>find</i> is consistent with other utilities using
       pattern matching.

       The <b>−size </b>operand refers to the size of a file, rather than the
       number of blocks it may occupy in the file system. The intent is that
       the <i>st_size</i> field defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 should be used, not the <i>st_blocks</i> found in historical
       implementations. There are at least two reasons for this:

        1. In both System V and BSD, <i>find</i> only uses <i>st_size</i> in size
           calculations for the operands specified by this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2008. (BSD uses <i>st_blocks</i> only when processing the <b>−ls</b>
           primary.)

        2. Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is also
           the unit used by the <i>ls</i> utility for the output from the <b>−l</b>
           option. (In both System V and BSD, <i>ls</i> uses <i>st_size</i> for the <b>−l</b>
           option size field and uses <i>st_blocks</i> for the <i>ls</i> <b>−s </b>calculations.
           This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify <i>ls</i> <b>−s</b>.)

       The descriptions of <b>−atime</b>, <b>−ctime</b>, and <b>−mtime </b>were changed from the
       SVID description of <i>n</i> ``days'' to <i>n</i> being the result of the integer
       division of the time difference in seconds by 86400. The description
       is also different in terms of the exact timeframe for the <i>n</i> case
       (<i>versus</i> the <i>+n</i> or <i>−n</i>), but it matches all known historical
       implementations. It refers to one 86400 second period in the past,
       not any time from the beginning of that period to the current time.
       For example, <b>−atime </b>2 is true if the file was accessed any time in
       the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.

       Historical implementations do not modify <b>"{}" </b>when it appears as a
       substring of an <b>−exec </b>or <b>−ok </b><i>utility_name</i> or argument string. There
       have been numerous user requests for this extension, so this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008 allows the desired behavior. At least one recent
       implementation does support this feature, but encountered several
       problems in managing memory allocation and dealing with multiple
       occurrences of <b>"{}" </b>in a string while it was being developed, so it
       is not yet required behavior.

       Assuming the presence of <b>−print </b>was added to correct a historical
       pitfall that plagues novice users, it is entirely upwards-compatible
       from the historical System V <i>find</i> utility. In its simplest form (<i>find</i>
       <i>directory</i>), it could be confused with the historical BSD fast <i>find</i>.
       The BSD developers agreed that adding <b>−print </b>as a default expression
       was the correct decision and have added the fast <i>find</i> functionality
       within a new utility called <i>locate</i>.

       Historically, the <b>−L </b>option was implemented using the primary
       <b>−follow</b>.  The <b>−H </b>and <b>−L </b>options were added for two reasons. First,
       they offer a finer granularity of control and consistency with other
       programs that walk file hierarchies. Second, the <b>−follow </b>primary
       always evaluated to true. As they were historically really global
       variables that took effect before the traversal began, some valid
       expressions had unexpected results. An example is the expression
       <b>−print −o −follow</b>.  Because <b>−print </b>always evaluates to true, the
       standard order of evaluation implies that <b>−follow </b>would never be
       evaluated. This was never the case. Historical practice for the
       <b>−follow </b>primary, however, is not consistent. Some implementations
       always follow symbolic links on the command line whether <b>−follow </b>is
       specified or not. Others follow symbolic links on the command line
       only if <b>−follow </b>is specified. Both behaviors are provided by the <b>−H</b>
       and <b>−L </b>options, but scripts using the current <b>−follow </b>primary would
       be broken if the <b>−follow </b>option is specified to work either way.

       Since the <b>−L </b>option resolves all symbolic links and the <b>−type </b><i>l</i>
       primary is true for symbolic links that still exist after symbolic
       links have been resolved, the command:

           <b>find −L . −type l</b>

       prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current directory
       that do not resolve to accessible files.

       A feature of SVR4's <i>find</i> utility was the <b>−exec </b>primary's <b>+</b>
       terminator. This allowed filenames containing special characters
       (especially &lt;newline&gt; characters) to be grouped together without the
       problems that occur if such filenames are piped to <i>xargs</i>.  Other
       implementations have added other ways to get around this problem,
       notably a <b>−print0 </b>primary that wrote filenames with a null byte
       terminator. This was considered here, but not adopted. Using a null
       terminator meant that any utility that was going to process <i>find</i>'s
       <b>−print0 </b>output had to add a new option to parse the null terminators
       it would now be reading.

       The <b>"−exec</b>...<b>{}</b>+" syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC
       Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this is an
       incompatible change to IEEE Std 1003.2‐1992. For example, the
       following command printed all files with a <b>'−' </b>after their name if
       they are regular files, and a <b>'+' </b>otherwise:

           <b>find / −type f −exec echo {} − ';' −o −exec echo {} + ';'</b>

       The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous
       standard stated that this usage would work, in practice many did not
       support it and the standard developers felt it better to now state
       that this was not allowable.
