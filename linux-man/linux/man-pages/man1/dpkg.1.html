       This manual is intended for users wishing to understand <b>dpkg</b>'s
       command line options and package states in more detail than that
       provided by <b>dpkg --help</b>.

       It should <i>not</i> be used by package maintainers wishing to understand
       how <b>dpkg </b>will install their packages. The descriptions of what <b>dpkg</b>
       does when installing and removing packages are particularly
       inadequate.
</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>dpkg </b>is a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages.
       The primary and more user-friendly front-end for <b>dpkg </b>is <b>aptitude</b>(1).
       <b>dpkg </b>itself is controlled entirely via command line parameters, which
       consist of exactly one action and zero or more options. The action-
       parameter tells <b>dpkg </b>what to do and options control the behavior of
       the action in some way.

       <b>dpkg </b>can also be used as a front-end to <a href="dpkg-deb.1.html">dpkg-deb(1)</a> and
       <a href="dpkg-query.1.html">dpkg-query(1)</a>. The list of supported actions can be found later on in
       the <b>ACTIONS </b>section. If any such action is encountered <b>dpkg </b>just runs
       <b>dpkg-deb </b>or <b>dpkg-query </b>with the parameters given to it, but no
       specific options are currently passed to them, to use any such option
       the back-ends need to be called directly.

<h2><a id="INFORMATION_ABOUT_PACKAGES" href="#INFORMATION_ABOUT_PACKAGES"></a>INFORMATION ABOUT PACKAGES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>dpkg </b>maintains some usable information about available packages. The
       information is divided in three classes: <b>states</b>, <b>selection states </b>and
       <b>flags</b>. These values are intended to be changed mainly with <b>dselect</b>.

   <b>Package states</b>
       <b>not-installed</b>
              The package is not installed on your system.

       <b>config-files</b>
              Only the configuration files of the package exist on the
              system.

       <b>half-installed</b>
              The installation of the package has been started, but not
              completed for some reason.

       <b>unpacked</b>
              The package is unpacked, but not configured.

       <b>half-configured</b>
              The package is unpacked and configuration has been started,
              but not yet completed for some reason.

       <b>triggers-awaited</b>
              The package awaits trigger processing by another package.

       <b>triggers-pending</b>
              The package has been triggered.

       <b>installed</b>
              The package is correctly unpacked and configured.

   <b>Package selection states</b>
       <b>install</b>
              The package is selected for installation.

       <b>hold   </b>A package marked to be on <b>hold </b>is not handled by <b>dpkg</b>, unless
              forced to do that with option <b>--force-hold</b>.

       <b>deinstall</b>
              The package is selected for deinstallation (i.e. we want to
              remove all files, except configuration files).

       <b>purge  </b>The package is selected to be purged (i.e. we want to remove
              everything from system directories, even configuration files).

   <b>Package flags</b>
       <b>ok     </b>A package marked <b>ok </b>is in a known state, but might need
              further processing.

       <b>reinstreq</b>
              A package marked <b>reinstreq </b>is broken and requires
              reinstallation. These packages cannot be removed, unless
              forced with option <b>--force-remove-reinstreq</b>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="ACTIONS" href="#ACTIONS"></a>ACTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-i</b>, <b>--install </b><i>package-file</i>...
              Install the package. If <b>--recursive </b>or <b>-R </b>option is specified,
              <i>package-file</i> must refer to a directory instead.

              Installation consists of the following steps:

              <b>1. </b>Extract the control files of the new package.

              <b>2. </b>If another version of the same package was installed before
              the new installation, execute <i>prerm</i> script of the old package.

              <b>3. </b>Run <i>preinst</i> script, if provided by the package.

              <b>4. </b>Unpack the new files, and at the same time back up the old
              files, so that if something goes wrong, they can be restored.

              <b>5. </b>If another version of the same package was installed before
              the new installation, execute the <i>postrm</i> script of the old
              package. Note that this script is executed after the <i>preinst</i>
              script of the new package, because new files are written at
              the same time old files are removed.

              <b>6. </b>Configure the package. See <b>--configure </b>for detailed
              information about how this is done.

       <b>--unpack </b><i>package-file</i>...
              Unpack the package, but don't configure it. If <b>--recursive </b>or
              <b>-R </b>option is specified, <i>package-file</i> must refer to a directory
              instead.

       <b>--configure </b><i>package</i>...|<b>-a</b>|<b>--pending</b>
              Configure a package which has been unpacked but not yet
              configured.  If <b>-a </b>or <b>--pending </b>is given instead of <i>package</i>,
              all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.

              To reconfigure a package which has already been configured,
              try the <b>dpkg-reconfigure</b>(8) command instead.

              Configuring consists of the following steps:

              <b>1. </b>Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back up the old
              conffiles, so that they can be restored if something goes
              wrong.

              <b>2. </b>Run <i>postinst</i> script, if provided by the package.

       <b>--triggers-only </b><i>package</i>...|<b>-a</b>|<b>--pending</b>
              Processes only triggers (since dpkg 1.14.17).  All pending
              triggers will be processed.  If package names are supplied
              only those packages' triggers will be processed, exactly once
              each where necessary. Use of this option may leave packages in
              the improper <b>triggers-awaited </b>and <b>triggers-pending </b>states.
              This can be fixed later by running: <b>dpkg --configure</b>
              <b>--pending</b>.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--remove </b><i>package</i>...|<b>-a</b>|<b>--pending</b>
              Remove an installed package. This removes everything except
              conffiles, which may avoid having to reconfigure the package
              if it is reinstalled later (conffiles are configuration files
              that are listed in the <i>DEBIAN/conffiles</i> control file).  If <b>-a</b>
              or <b>--pending </b>is given instead of a package name, then all
              packages unpacked, but marked to be removed in file
              <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status</i>, are removed.

              Removing of a package consists of the following steps:

              <b>1. </b>Run <i>prerm</i> script

              <b>2. </b>Remove the installed files

              <b>3. </b>Run <i>postrm</i> script

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--purge </b><i>package</i>...|<b>-a</b>|<b>--pending</b>
              Purge an installed or already removed package. This removes
              everything, including conffiles.  If <b>-a </b>or <b>--pending </b>is given
              instead of a package name, then all packages unpacked or
              removed, but marked to be purged in file
              <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status</i>, are purged.

              Note: some configuration files might be unknown to <b>dpkg</b>
              because they are created and handled separately through the
              configuration scripts. In that case, <b>dpkg </b>won't remove them by
              itself, but the package's <i>postrm</i> script (which is called by
              <b>dpkg</b>), has to take care of their removal during purge. Of
              course, this only applies to files in system directories, not
              configuration files written to individual users' home
              directories.

              Purging of a package consists of the following steps:

              <b>1. </b>Remove the package, if not already removed. See <b>--remove</b>
              for detailed information about how this is done.

              <b>2. </b>Run <i>postrm</i> script.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verify </b>[<i>package-name</i>...]
              Verifies the integrity of <i>package-name</i> or all packages if
              omitted, by comparing information from the files installed by
              a package with the files metadata information stored in the
              <b>dpkg </b>database (since dpkg 1.17.2).  The origin of the files
              metadata information in the database is the binary packages
              themselves. That metadata gets collected at package unpack
              time during the installation process.

              Currently the only functional check performed is an md5sum
              verification of the file contents against the stored value in
              the files database.  It will only get checked if the database
              contains the file md5sum. To check for any missing metadata in
              the database, the <b>--audit </b>command can be used.

              The output format is selectable with the <b>--verify-format</b>
              option, which by default uses the <b>rpm </b>format, but that might
              change in the future, and as such, programs parsing this
              command output should be explicit about the format they
              expect.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--audit </b>[<i>package-name</i>...]
              Performs database sanity and consistency checks for <i>package-</i>
              <i>name</i> or all packages if omitted (per package checks since dpkg
              1.17.10).  For example, searches for packages that have been
              installed only partially on your system or that have missing,
              wrong or obsolete control data or files. <b>dpkg </b>will suggest
              what to do with them to get them fixed.

       <b>--update-avail </b>[<i>Packages-file</i>]
       <b>--merge-avail </b>[<i>Packages-file</i>]
              Update <b>dpkg</b>'s and <b>dselect</b>'s idea of which packages are
              available. With action <b>--merge-avail</b>, old information is
              combined with information from <i>Packages-file</i>. With action
              <b>--update-avail</b>, old information is replaced with the
              information in the <i>Packages-file</i>. The <i>Packages-file</i>
              distributed with Debian is simply named «<i>Packages</i>». If the
              <i>Packages-file</i> argument is missing or named «<b>-</b>» then it will be
              read from standard input (since dpkg 1.17.7). <b>dpkg </b>keeps its
              record of available packages in
              <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available</i>.

              A simpler one-shot command to retrieve and update the
              <i>available</i> file is <b>dselect update</b>. Note that this file is
              mostly useless if you don't use <b>dselect </b>but an APT-based
              frontend: APT has its own system to keep track of available
              packages.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--record-avail </b><i>package-file</i>...
              Update <b>dpkg </b>and <b>dselect</b>'s idea of which packages are available
              with information from the package <i>package-file</i>. If <b>--recursive</b>
              or <b>-R </b>option is specified, <i>package-file</i> must refer to a
              directory instead.

       <b>--forget-old-unavail</b>
              Now <b>obsolete </b>and a no-op as <b>dpkg </b>will automatically forget
              uninstalled unavailable packages (since dpkg 1.15.4), but only
              those that do not contain user information such as package
              selections.

       <b>--clear-avail</b>
              Erase the existing information about what packages are
              available.

       <b>--get-selections </b>[<i>package-name-pattern</i>...]
              Get list of package selections, and write it to stdout.
              Without a pattern, non-installed packages (i.e. those which
              have been previously purged) will not be shown.

       <b>--set-selections</b>
              Set package selections using file read from stdin. This file
              should be in the format “<i>package state</i>”, where state is one of
              <b>install</b>, <b>hold</b>, <b>deinstall </b>or <b>purge</b>. Blank lines and comment
              lines beginning with ‘<b>#</b>’ are also permitted.

              The <i>available</i> file needs to be up-to-date for this command to
              be useful, otherwise unknown packages will be ignored with a
              warning. See the <b>--update-avail </b>and <b>--merge-avail </b>commands for
              more information.

       <b>--clear-selections</b>
              Set the requested state of every non-essential package to
              deinstall (since dpkg 1.13.18).  This is intended to be used
              immediately before <b>--set-selections</b>, to deinstall any packages
              not in list given to <b>--set-selections</b>.

       <b>--yet-to-unpack</b>
              Searches for packages selected for installation, but which for
              some reason still haven't been installed.

       <b>--predep-package</b>
              Print a single package which is the target of one or more
              relevant pre-dependencies and has itself no unsatisfied pre-
              dependencies.

              If such a package is present, output it as a Packages file
              entry, which can be massaged as appropriate.

              Returns 0 when a package is printed, 1 when no suitable
              package is available and 2 on error.

       <b>--add-architecture </b><i>architecture</i>
              Add <i>architecture</i> to the list of architectures for which
              packages can be installed without using <b>--force-architecture</b>
              (since dpkg 1.16.2).  The architecture <b>dpkg </b>is built for (i.e.
              the output of <b>--print-architecture</b>) is always part of that
              list.

       <b>--remove-architecture </b><i>architecture</i>
              Remove <i>architecture</i> from the list of architectures for which
              packages can be installed without using <b>--force-architecture</b>
              (since dpkg 1.16.2). If the architecture is currently in use
              in the database then the operation will be refused, except if
              <b>--force-architecture </b>is specified. The architecture <b>dpkg </b>is
              built for (i.e. the output of <b>--print-architecture</b>) can never
              be removed from that list.

       <b>--print-architecture</b>
              Print architecture of packages <b>dpkg </b>installs (for example,
              “i386”).

       <b>--print-foreign-architectures</b>
              Print a newline-separated list of the extra architectures <b>dpkg</b>
              is configured to allow packages to be installed for (since
              dpkg 1.16.2).

       <b>--assert-</b><i>feature</i>
              Asserts that <b>dpkg </b>supports the requested feature.  Returns 0
              if the feature is fully supported, 1 if the feature is known
              but <b>dpkg </b>cannot provide support for it yet, and 2 if the
              feature is unknown.  The current list of assertable features
              is:

              <b>support-predepends</b>
                     Supports the <b>Pre-Depends </b>field (since dpkg 1.1.0).

              <b>working-epoch</b>
                     Supports epochs in version strings (since dpkg

              <b>long-filenames</b>
                     Supports long filenames in <a href="../man5/deb.5.html">deb(5)</a> archives (since dpkg
                     1.4.1.17).

              <b>multi-conrep</b>
                     Supports multiple <b>Conflicts </b>and <b>Replaces </b>(since dpkg
                     1.4.1.19).

              <b>multi-arch</b>
                     Supports multi-arch fields and semantics (since dpkg
                     1.16.2).

              <b>versioned-provides</b>
                     Supports versioned <b>Provides </b>(since dpkg 1.17.11).

       <b>--compare-versions </b><i>ver1 op ver2</i>
              Compare version numbers, where <i>op</i> is a binary operator. <b>dpkg</b>
              returns true (<b>0</b>) if the specified condition is satisfied, and
              false (<b>1</b>) otherwise. There are two groups of operators, which
              differ in how they treat an empty <i>ver1</i> or <i>ver2</i>. These treat an
              empty version as earlier than any version: <b>lt le eq ne ge gt</b>.
              These treat an empty version as later than any version: <b>lt-nl</b>
              <b>le-nl ge-nl gt-nl</b>. These are provided only for compatibility
              with control file syntax: <b>&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;= = &gt;= &gt;&gt; &gt;</b>. The <b>&lt; </b>and <b>&gt;</b>
              operators are obsolete and should <b>not </b>be used, due to
              confusing semantics. To illustrate: <b>0.1 &lt; 0.1 </b>evaluates to
              true.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--auto-deconfigure</b>
              When a package is removed, there is a possibility that another
              installed package depended on the removed package. Specifying
              this option will cause automatic deconfiguration of the

       <b>--force-</b><i>things</i>
       <b>--no-force-</b><i>things</i>, <b>--refuse-</b><i>things</i>
              Force or refuse (<b>no-force </b>and <b>refuse </b>mean the same thing) to
              do some things. <i>things</i> is a comma separated list of things
              specified below. <b>--force-help </b>displays a message describing
              them.  Things marked with (*) are forced by default.

              <i>Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by</i>
              <i>experts only. Using them without fully understanding their</i>
              <i>effects may break your whole system.</i>

              <b>all</b>: Turns on (or off) all force options.

              <b>downgrade</b>(*): Install a package, even if newer version of it
              is already installed.

              <i>Warning: At present</i> <b>dpkg </b><i>does not do any dependency checking</i>
              <i>on downgrades and therefore will not warn you if the downgrade</i>
              <i>breaks the dependency of some other package. This can have</i>
              <i>serious side effects, downgrading essential system components</i>
              <i>can even make your whole system unusable. Use with care.</i>

              <b>configure-any</b>: Configure also any unpacked but unconfigured
              packages on which the current package depends.

              <b>hold</b>: Process packages even when marked “hold”.

              <b>remove-reinstreq</b>: Remove a package, even if it's broken and
              marked to require reinstallation. This may, for example, cause
              parts of the package to remain on the system, which will then
              be forgotten by <b>dpkg</b>.

              <b>remove-essential</b>: Remove, even if the package is considered
              essential. Essential packages contain mostly very basic Unix
              commands. Removing them might cause the whole system to stop
              working, so use with caution.

              <b>depends</b>: Turn all dependency problems into warnings.

              <b>depends-version</b>: Don't care about versions when checking
              dependencies.

              <b>breaks</b>: Install, even if this would break another package
              (since dpkg 1.14.6).

              <b>conflicts</b>: Install, even if it conflicts with another package.
              This is dangerous, for it will usually cause overwriting of
              some files.

              <b>confmiss</b>: If a conffile is missing and the version in the
              package did change, always install the missing conffile
              without prompting. This is dangerous, since it means not
              preserving a change (removing) made to the file.

              <b>confnew</b>: If a conffile has been modified and the version in
              the package did change, always install the new version without
              prompting, unless the <b>--force-confdef </b>is also specified, in
              which case the default action is preferred.

              <b>confold</b>: If a conffile has been modified and the version in
              the package did change, always keep the old version without
              prompting, unless the <b>--force-confdef </b>is also specified, in
              which case the default action is preferred.

              <b>confdef</b>: If a conffile has been modified and the version in
              the package did change, always choose the default action
              without prompting. If there is no default action it will stop
              to ask the user unless <b>--force-confnew </b>or <b>--force-confold </b>is
              also been given, in which case it will use that to decide the
              final action.

              <b>confask</b>: If a conffile has been modified always offer to
              replace it with the version in the package, even if the
              version in the package did not change (since dpkg 1.15.8).  If
              any of <b>--force-confmiss</b>, <b>--force-confnew</b>, <b>--force-confold</b>, or
              <b>--force-confdef </b>is also given, it will be used to decide the
              final action.

              <b>overwrite</b>: Overwrite one package's file with another's file.

              <b>overwrite-dir</b>: Overwrite one package's directory with
              another's file.

              <b>overwrite-diverted</b>: Overwrite a diverted file with an
              undiverted version.

              <b>unsafe-io</b>: Do not perform safe I/O operations when unpacking
              (since dpkg 1.15.8.6).  Currently this implies not performing
              file system syncs before file renames, which is known to cause
              substantial performance degradation on some file systems,
              unfortunately the ones that require the safe I/O on the first
              place due to their unreliable behaviour causing zero-length
              files on abrupt system crashes.

              <i>Note</i>: For ext4, the main offender, consider using instead the
              mount option <b>nodelalloc</b>, which will fix both the performance
              degradation and the data safety issues, the latter by making
              the file system not produce zero-length files on abrupt system
              crashes with any software not doing syncs before atomic
              renames.

              <i>Warning: Using this option might improve performance at the</i>
              <i>cost of losing data, use with care.</i>

              <b>script-chrootless</b>: Run maintainer scrips without <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a>ing
              into <b>instdir </b>even if the package does not support this mode of
              operation (since dpkg 1.18.5).

              <i>Warning: This can destroy your host system, use with extreme</i>
              <i>care.</i>

              <b>architecture</b>: Process even packages with wrong or no
              architecture.

              <b>bad-version</b>: Process even packages with wrong versions (since
              dpkg 1.16.1).

              <b>bad-path</b>: <b>PATH </b>is missing important programs, so problems are
              likely.

              <b>not-root</b>: Try to (de)install things even when not root.

              <b>bad-verify</b>: Install a package even if it fails authenticity
              check.

       <b>--ignore-depends</b>=<i>package</i>,...
              Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually,
              checking is performed, but only warnings about conflicts are
              given, nothing else).

       <b>--no-act</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--simulate</b>
              Do everything which is supposed to be done, but don't write
              any changes. This is used to see what would happen with the
              specified action, without actually modifying anything.

              Be sure to give <b>--no-act </b>before the action-parameter, or you
              might end up with undesirable results. (e.g. <b>dpkg --purge foo</b>
              <b>--no-act </b>will first purge package foo and then try to purge
              package --no-act, even though you probably expected it to
              actually do nothing)

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              Recursively handle all regular files matching pattern <b>*.deb</b>
              found at specified directories and all of its subdirectories.
              This can be used with <b>-i</b>, <b>-A</b>, <b>--install</b>, <b>--unpack </b>and
              <b>--record-avail </b>actions.

       <b>-G     </b>Don't install a package if a newer version of the same package
              is already installed. This is an alias of <b>--refuse-downgrade</b>.

       <b>--admindir=</b><i>dir</i>
              Change default administrative directory, which contains many
              files that give information about status of installed or
              uninstalled packages, etc.  (Defaults to
              «<i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>»)

       <b>--instdir=</b><i>dir</i>
              Change default installation directory which refers to the
              directory where packages are to be installed. <b>instdir </b>is also
              the directory passed to <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> before running package's
              installation scripts, which means that the scripts see <b>instdir</b>
              as a root directory.  (Defaults to «<i>/</i>»)

       <b>--root=</b><i>dir</i>
              Changing <b>root </b>changes <b>instdir </b>to «<i>dir</i>» and <b>admindir </b>to
              «<i>dir</i><b>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</b>».

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--selected-only</b>
              Only process the packages that are selected for installation.
              The actual marking is done with <b>dselect </b>or by <b>dpkg</b>, when it
              handles packages. For example, when a package is removed, it
              will be marked selected for deinstallation.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--skip-same-version</b>
              Don't install the package if the same version of the package
              is already installed.

       <b>--pre-invoke=</b><i>command</i>
       <b>--post-invoke=</b><i>command</i>
              Set an invoke hook <i>command</i> to be run via “sh -c” before or
              after the <b>dpkg </b>run for the <i>unpack</i>, <i>configure</i>, <i>install</i>,
              <i>triggers-only</i>, <i>remove</i>, <i>purge</i>, <i>add-architecture</i> and
              <i>remove-architecture</i> <b>dpkg </b>actions (since dpkg 1.15.4;
              <i>add-architecture</i> and <i>remove-architecture</i> actions since dpkg
              1.17.19). This option can be specified multiple times. The
              order the options are specified is preserved, with the ones
              from the configuration files taking precedence.  The
              environment variable <b>DPKG_HOOK_ACTION </b>is set for the hooks to
              the current <b>dpkg </b>action. Note: front-ends might call <b>dpkg</b>
              several times per invocation, which might run the hooks more
              times than expected.

       <b>--path-exclude=</b><i>glob-pattern</i>
       <b>--path-include=</b><i>glob-pattern</i>
              Set <i>glob-pattern</i> as a path filter, either by excluding or re-
              including previously excluded paths matching the specified
              patterns during install (since dpkg 1.15.8).

              <i>Warning: take into account that depending on the excluded</i>
              <i>paths you might completely break your system, use with</i>
              <i>caution.</i>

              The glob patterns use the same wildcards used in the shell,
              were ‘*’ matches any sequence of characters, including the
              empty string and also ‘/’.  For example, «<i>/usr/*/READ*</i>»
              matches «<i>/usr/share/doc/package/README</i>».  As usual, ‘?’
              matches any single character (again, including ‘/’).  And ‘[’
              starts a character class, which can contain a list of
              characters, ranges and complementations. See <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a> for
              detailed information about globbing. Note: the current
              implementation might re-include more directories and symlinks
              than needed, to be on the safe side and avoid possible unpack
              failures; future work might fix this.

              This can be used to remove all paths except some particular
              ones; a typical case is:

              <b>--path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*</b>
              <b>--path-include=/usr/share/doc/*/copyright</b>

              to remove all documentation files except the copyright files.

              These two options can be specified multiple times, and
              interleaved with each other. Both are processed in the given
              order, with the last rule that matches a file name making the
              decision.

              The filters are applied when unpacking the binary packages,
              and as such only have knowledge of the type of object
              currently being filtered (e.g. a normal file or a directory)
              and have not visibility of what objects will come next.
              Because these filters have side effects (in contrast to
              <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a> filters), excluding an exact pathname that happens to
              be a directory object like <i>/usr/share/doc</i> will not have the
              desired result, and only that pathname will be excluded (which
              could be automatically reincluded if the code sees the need).
              Any subsequent files contained within that directory will fail
              to unpack.

              Hint: make sure the globs are not expanded by your shell.

       <b>--verify-format </b><i>format-name</i>
              Sets the output format for the <b>--verify </b>command (since dpkg
              1.17.2).

              The only currently supported output format is <b>rpm</b>, which
              consists of a line for every path that failed any check.  The
              lines start with 9 characters to report each specific check
              result, a ‘<b>?</b>’ implies the check could not be done (lack of
              support, file permissions, etc), ‘<b>.</b>’ implies the check passed,
              and an alphanumeric character implies a specific check failed;
              the md5sum verification failure (the file contents have
              changed) is denoted with a ‘<b>5</b>’ on the third character.  The
              line is followed by a space and an attribute character
              (currently ‘<b>c</b>’ for conffiles), another space and the pathname.

       <b>--status-fd </b><i>n</i>
              Send machine-readable package status and progress information
              to file descriptor <i>n</i>. This option can be specified multiple
              times. The information is generally one record per line, in
              one of the following forms:

              <b>status: </b><i>package</i><b>: </b><i>status</i>
                     Package status changed; <i>status</i> is as in the status
                     file.

              <b>status: </b><i>package</i> <b>: error : </b><i>extended-error-message</i>
                     An error occurred. Any possible newlines in <i>extended-</i>
                     <i>error-message</i> will be converted to spaces before
                     output.

              <b>status: </b><i>file</i> <b>: conffile-prompt : '</b><i>real-old</i><b>' '</b><i>real-new</i><b>'</b>
              <i>useredited distedited</i>
                     User is being asked a conffile question.

              <b>processing: </b><i>stage</i><b>: </b><i>package</i>
                     Sent just before a processing stage starts. <i>stage</i> is
                     one of <b>upgrade</b>, <b>install </b>(both sent before unpacking),
                     <b>configure</b>, <b>trigproc</b>, <b>disappear</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b>.

       <b>--status-logger</b>=<i>command</i>
              Send machine-readable package status and progress information
              to the shell <i>command</i>'s standard input, to be run via “sh -c”
              (since dpkg 1.16.0).  This option can be specified multiple
              times.  The output format used is the same as in <b>--status-fd</b>.

       <b>--log=</b><i>filename</i>
              Log status change updates and actions to <i>filename</i>, instead of
              the default <i>/usr/local/var/log/dpkg.log</i>. If this option is
              given multiple times, the last filename is used. Log messages
              are of the form:

              YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <b>startup </b><i>type command</i>
                     For each dpkg invocation where <i>type</i> is <b>archives </b>(with a
                     <i>command</i> of <b>unpack </b>or <b>install</b>) or <b>packages </b>(with a
                     <i>command</i> of <b>configure</b>, <b>triggers-only</b>, <b>remove </b>or <b>purge</b>).

              YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <b>status </b><i>state pkg installed-version</i>
                     For status change updates.

              YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <i>action pkg installed-version available-</i>
              <i>version</i>
                     For actions where <i>action</i> is one of <b>install</b>, <b>upgrade</b>,
                     <b>configure</b>, <b>trigproc</b>, <b>disappear</b>, <b>remove </b>or <b>purge</b>.

              YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <b>conffile </b><i>filename decision</i>
                     For conffile changes where <i>decision</i> is either <b>install</b>
                     or <b>keep</b>.

       <b>--no-debsig</b>
              Do not try to verify package signatures.

       <b>--no-triggers</b>
              Do not run any triggers in this run (since dpkg 1.14.17), but
              activations will still be recorded.  If used with <b>--configure</b>
              <i>package</i> or <b>--triggers-only </b><i>package</i> then the named package
              postinst will still be run even if only a triggers run is
              needed. Use of this option may leave packages in the improper
              <b>triggers-awaited </b>and <b>triggers-pending </b>states. This can be
              fixed later by running: <b>dpkg --configure --pending</b>.

       <b>--triggers</b>
              Cancels a previous <b>--no-triggers </b>(since dpkg 1.14.17).

              point to the system paths where several required programs are
              to be found. If it's not set or the programs are not found,
              <b>dpkg </b>will abort.

       <b>HOME   </b>If set, <b>dpkg </b>will use it as the directory from which to read
              the user specific configuration file.

       <b>TMPDIR </b>If set, <b>dpkg </b>will use it as the directory in which to create
              temporary files and directories.

       <b>PAGER  </b>The program <b>dpkg </b>will execute when displaying the conffiles.

       <b>SHELL  </b>The program <b>dpkg </b>will execute when starting a new interactive
              shell.

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
              Sets the number of columns <b>dpkg </b>should use when displaying
              formatted text.  Currently only used by <b>--list</b>.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
              Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
              accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
              Defined by <b>dpkg </b>on the maintainer script environment to
              indicate which installation to act on (since dpkg 1.18.5).
              The value is intended to be prepended to any path maintainer
              scripts operate on.  During normal operation, this variable is
              empty.  When installing packages into a different <b>instdir</b>,
              <b>dpkg </b>normally invokes maintainer scripts using <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> and
              leaves this variable empty, but if <b>--force-script-chrootless</b>
              is specified then the <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> call is skipped and <b>instdir </b>is
              non-empty.

       <b>DPKG_SHELL_REASON</b>

              1.14.17).

       <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE_REFCOUNT</b>
              Defined by <b>dpkg </b>on the maintainer script environment to the
              package reference count, i.e. the number of package instances
              with a state greater than <b>not-installed </b>(since dpkg 1.17.2).

       <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_ARCH</b>
              Defined by <b>dpkg </b>on the maintainer script environment to the
              architecture the package got built for (since dpkg 1.15.4).

       <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME</b>

       To list installed packages related to the editor <b>vi</b>(1) (note that
       <b>dpkg-query </b>does not load the <i>available</i> file anymore by default, and
       the <b>dpkg-query --load-avail </b>option should be used instead for that):
            <b>dpkg -l '*vi*'</b>

       To see the entries in <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available</i> of two
       packages:
            <b>dpkg --print-avail elvis vim | less</b>

       To search the listing of packages yourself:
            <b>less /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available</b>

       To remove an installed elvis package:
            <b>dpkg -r elvis</b>

       To install a package, you first need to find it in an archive or
       CDROM. The <i>available</i> file shows that the vim package is in section
       <b>editors</b>:
            <b>cd /media/cdrom/pool/main/v/vim</b>
            <b>dpkg -i vim_4.5-3.deb</b>

       To make a local copy of the package selection states:
            <b>dpkg --get-selections &gt;myselections</b>

       You might transfer this file to another computer, and after having
       updated the <i>available</i> file there with your package manager frontend
       of choice (see <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ">https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ</a> for more
       details), for example:
            <b>apt-cache dumpavail | dpkg --merge-avail</b>
       or with dpkg 1.17.6 and earlier:
            <b>avail=`mktemp`</b>
            <b>apt-cache dumpavail &gt;"$avail"</b>
            <b>dpkg --merge-avail "$avail"</b>
            <b>rm "$avail"</b>
       you can install it with:
            <b>dpkg --clear-selections</b>
            <b>dpkg --set-selections &lt;myselections</b>

       Note that this will not actually install or remove anything, but just
       set the selection state on the requested packages. You will need some
       other application to actually download and install the requested
       packages. For example, run <b>apt-get dselect-upgrade</b>.

       Ordinarily, you will find that <a href="dselect.1.html">dselect(1)</a> provides a more convenient
       way to modify the package selection states.
