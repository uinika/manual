<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>patch</i> utility shall read a source (patch) file containing any of
       four forms of difference (diff) listings produced by the <i>diff</i> utility
       (normal, copied context, unified context, or in the style of <i>ed</i>) and
       apply those differences to a file. By default, <i>patch</i> shall read from
       the standard input.

       The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to determine the type of the <i>diff</i>
       listing, unless overruled by a <b>−c</b>, <b>−e</b>, <b>−n</b>, or <b>−u </b>option.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, <i>patch</i> shall attempt
       to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files. (In
       this case, the application shall ensure that the name of the patch
       file is determinable for each <i>diff</i> listing.)
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>patch</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>−b        </b>Save a copy of the original contents of each modified file,
                 before the differences are applied, in a file of the same
                 name with the suffix <b>.orig </b>appended to it. If the file
                 already exists, it shall be overwritten; if multiple
                 patches are applied to the same file, the <b>.orig </b>file shall
                 be written only for the first patch. When the <b>−o </b><i>outfile</i>
                 option is also specified, <i>file</i><b>.orig </b>shall not be created
                 but, if <i>outfile</i> already exists, <i>outfile</i><b>.orig </b>shall be
                 created.

       <b>−c        </b>Interpret the patch file as a copied context difference
                 (the output of the utility <i>diff</i> when the <b>−c </b>or <b>−C </b>options
                 are specified).

       <b>−d </b><i>dir</i>    Change the current directory to <i>dir</i> before processing as
                 described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <b>−D </b><i>define</i> Mark changes with one of the following C preprocessor
                 constructs:

                     <b>#ifdef define</b>
                     <b>...</b>
                     <b>#endif</b>

                     #ifndef define
                     ...
                     #endif

                 optionally combined with the C preprocessor construct
                 <b>#else</b>.  If the patched file is processed with the C
                 preprocessor, where the macro <i>define</i> is defined, the output
                 shall contain the changes from the patch file; otherwise,
                 the output shall not contain the patches specified in the
                 patch file.

       <b>−e        </b>Interpret the patch file as an <i>ed</i> script, rather than a
                 <i>diff</i> script.

       <b>−i </b><i>patchfile</i>
                 Read the patch information from the file named by the
                 pathname <i>patchfile</i>, rather than the standard input.

       <b>−l        </b>(The letter ell.) Cause any sequence of &lt;blank&gt; characters
                 in the difference script to match any sequence of &lt;blank&gt;
                 characters in the input file. Other characters shall be
                 matched exactly.

       <b>−n        </b>Interpret the script as a normal difference.

       <b>−N        </b>Ignore patches where the differences have already been
                 applied to the file; by default, already-applied patches
                 shall be rejected.

       <b>−o </b><i>outfile</i>
                 Instead of modifying the files (specified by the <i>file</i>
                 operand or the difference listings) directly, write a copy
                 of the file referenced by each patch, with the appropriate
                 differences applied, to <i>outfile</i>.  Multiple patches for a
                 single file shall be applied to the intermediate versions
                 of the file created by any previous patches, and shall
                 result in multiple, concatenated versions of the file being
                 written to <i>outfile</i>.

       <b>−p </b><i>num</i>    For all pathnames in the patch file that indicate the names
                 of files to be patched, delete <i>num</i> pathname components from
                 the beginning of each pathname. If the pathname in the
                 patch file is absolute, any leading &lt;slash&gt; characters
                 shall be considered the first component (that is, <b>−p 1</b>
                 shall remove the leading &lt;slash&gt; characters). Specifying
                 <b>−p 0 </b>shall cause the full pathname to be used. If <b>−p </b>is not
                 specified, only the basename (the final pathname component)
                 shall be used.

       <b>−R        </b>Reverse the sense of the patch script; that is, assume that
                 the difference script was created from the new version to
                 the old version.  The <b>−R </b>option cannot be used with <i>ed</i>
                 scripts. The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to reverse each
                 portion of the script before applying it. Rejected
                 differences shall be saved in swapped format. If this
                 option is not specified, and until a portion of the patch
                 file is successfully applied, <i>patch</i> attempts to apply each
                 portion in its reversed sense as well as in its normal
                 sense. If the attempt is successful, the user shall be
                 prompted to determine whether the <b>−R </b>option should be set.

       <b>−r </b><i>rejectfile</i>
                 Override the default reject filename. In the default case,
                 the reject file shall have the same name as the output
                 file, with the suffix <b>.rej </b>appended to it; see <i>Patch</i>
                 <i>Application</i>.

       <b>−u        </b>Interpret the patch file as a unified context difference
                 (the output of the <i>diff</i> utility when the <b>−u </b>or <b>−U </b>options
                 are specified).

       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>patch</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 8.2</i>, <i>Internationalization</i>
                 <i>Variables</i> the precedence of internationalization variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
                 used in the extended regular expression defined for the
                 <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
                 as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input
                 files), and the behavior of character classes used in the
                 extended regular expression defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale
                 keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative responses,
                 and the locale used to affect the format and contents of
                 diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the locale for recognizing the format of file
                 timestamps written by the <i>diff</i> utility in a context-

       A patch file may contain patching instructions for more than one
       file; filenames shall be determined as specified in <i>Filename</i>
       <i>Determination</i>.  When the <b>−b </b>option is specified, for each patched
       file, the original shall be saved in a file of the same name with the
       suffix <b>.orig </b>appended to it.

       For each patched file, a reject file may also be created as noted in
       <i>Patch Application</i>.  In the absence of a <b>−r </b>option, the name of this
       file shall be formed by appending the suffix <b>.rej </b>to the original
       filename.

   <b>Patch File Format</b>
       The patch file shall contain zero or more lines of header information
       followed by one or more patches. Each patch shall contain zero or
       more lines of filename identification in the format produced by the
       <b>−c</b>, <b>−C</b>, <b>−u</b>, or <b>−U </b>options of the <i>diff</i> utility, and one or more sets
       of <i>diff</i> output, which are customarily called <i>hunks</i>.

       The <i>patch</i> utility shall recognize the following expression in the
       header information:

       <b>Index: </b><i>pathname</i>
             The file to be patched is named <i>pathname</i>.

       If all lines (including headers) within a patch begin with the same
       leading sequence of &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
       remove this sequence before proceeding. Within each patch, if the
       type of difference is common context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
       recognize the following expressions:

       *** <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches arose from <i>filename</i>.

       −−− <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches should be applied to <i>filename</i>.

       If the type of difference is unified context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
       recognize the following expressions:

       −−− <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches arose from <i>filename</i>.

       +++ <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches should be applied to <i>filename</i>.

       Each hunk within a patch shall be the <i>diff</i> output to change a line
       range within the original file. The line numbers for successive hunks
       within a patch shall occur in ascending order.

   <b>Filename Determination</b>
       If no <i>file</i> operand is specified, <i>patch</i> shall perform the following
       steps to determine the filename to use:

        1. If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete
           pathname components (as specified by the <b>−p </b>option) from the
           filename on the line beginning with <b>"***" </b>(if copied context) or
           <b>"−−−" </b>(if unified context), then test for the existence of this
           file relative to the current directory (or the directory
           specified with the <b>−d </b>option). If the file exists, the <i>patch</i>
           utility shall use this filename.

        2. If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete
           the pathname components (as specified by the <b>−p </b>option) from the
           filename on the line beginning with <b>"−−−" </b>(if copied context) or
           <b>"+++" </b>(if unified context), then test for the existence of this
           file relative to the current directory (or the directory
           specified with the <b>−d </b>option). If the file exists, the <i>patch</i>
           utility shall use this filename.

        3. If the header information contains a line beginning with the
           string <b>Index:</b>, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete pathname components
           (as specified by the <b>−p </b>option) from this line, then test for the
           existence of this file relative to the current directory (or the
           directory specified with the <b>−d </b>option). If the file exists, the
           <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.

        4. If an <b>SCCS </b>directory exists in the current directory, <i>patch</i> shall
           attempt to perform a <i>get</i> <b>−e SCCS/s.</b><i>filename</i> command to retrieve
           an editable version of the file. If the file exists, the <i>patch</i>
           utility shall use this filename.

        5. The <i>patch</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard output and
           request a filename interactively from the controlling terminal
           (for example, <b>/dev/tty</b>).

   <b>Patch Application</b>
       If the <b>−c</b>, <b>−e</b>, <b>−n</b>, or <b>−u </b>option is present, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
       interpret information within each hunk as a copied context
       difference, an <i>ed</i> difference, a normal difference, or a unified
       context difference, respectively. In the absence of any of these
       options, the <i>patch</i> utility shall determine the type of difference
       based on the format of information within the hunk.

       For each hunk, the <i>patch</i> utility shall begin to search for the place
       to apply the patch at the line number at the beginning of the hunk,
       plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk. If lines
       matching the hunk context are not found, <i>patch</i> shall scan both
       forwards and backwards at least 1000 bytes for a set of lines that
       match the hunk context.

       If no such place is found and it is a context difference, then
       another scan shall take place, ignoring the first and last line of
       context. If that fails, the first two and last two lines of context
       shall be ignored and another scan shall be made. Implementations may
       search more extensively for installation locations.

       If no location can be found, the <i>patch</i> utility shall append the hunk
       to the reject file. A rejected hunk that is a copied context
       difference, an <i>ed</i> difference, or a normal difference shall be written
       in copied-context-difference format regardless of the format of the
       patch file. It is implementation-defined whether a rejected hunk that
       is a unified context difference is written in copied-context-
       difference format or in unified-context-difference format.  If the
       input was a normal or <i>ed</i>-style difference, the reject file may
       contain differences with zero lines of context. The line numbers on
       the hunks in the reject file may be different from the line numbers
       in the patch file since they shall reflect the approximate locations
       for the failed hunks in the new file rather than the old one.

       If the type of patch is an <i>ed</i> diff, the implementation may accomplish
       the patching by invoking the <i>ed</i> utility.

       The <b>−R </b>option does not work with <i>ed</i> scripts because there is too
       little information to reconstruct the reverse operation.

       The <b>−p </b>option makes it possible to customize a patch file to local
       user directory structures without manually editing the patch file.
       For example, if the filename in the patch file was:

           <b>/curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       Setting <b>−p 0 </b>gives the entire pathname unmodified; <b>−p 1 </b>gives:

           <b>curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       without the leading &lt;slash&gt;, <b>−p 4 </b>gives:

           <b>blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       and not specifying <b>−p </b>at all gives:

           <b>blurfl.c .</b>

       Some of the functionality in historical <i>patch</i> implementations was not
       specified. The following documents those features present in
       historical implementations that have not been specified.

       A deleted piece of functionality was the <b>'+' </b>pseudo-option allowing
       an additional set of options and a patch file operand to be given.
       This was seen as being insufficiently useful to standardize.

       In historical implementations, if the string <b>"Prereq:" </b>appeared in
       the header, the <i>patch</i> utility would search for the corresponding
       version information (the string specified in the header, delimited by
       &lt;blank&gt; characters or the beginning or end of a line or the file)
       anywhere in the original file. This was deleted as too simplistic and
       insufficiently trustworthy a mechanism to standardize. For example,
       if:

           <b>Prereq: 1.2</b>

       were in the header, the presence of a delimited 1.2 anywhere in the
       file would satisfy the prerequisite.

       The following options were dropped from historical implementations of
       <i>patch</i> as insufficiently useful to standardize:

       <b>−b        </b>The <b>−b </b>option historically provided a method for changing
                 the name extension of the backup file from the default
                 <b>.orig</b>.  This option has been modified and retained in this
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008.

       <b>−F        </b>The <b>−F </b>option specified the number of lines of a context
                 diff to ignore when searching for a place to install a
                 patch.

       <b>−f        </b>The <b>−f </b>option historically caused <i>patch</i> not to request
                 additional information from the user.

       <b>−r        </b>The <b>−r </b>option historically provided a method of overriding
                 the extension of the reject file from the default <b>.rej</b>.

       <b>−s        </b>The <b>−s </b>option historically caused <i>patch</i> to work silently
                 unless an error occurred.

       <b>−x        </b>The <b>−x </b>option historically set internal debugging flags.

       In some file system implementations, the saving of a <b>.orig </b>file may
       produce unwanted results. In the case of 12, 13, or 14-character
       filenames (on file systems supporting 14-character maximum
       filenames), the <b>.orig </b>file overwrites the new file. The reject file
       may also exceed this filename limit. It was suggested, due to some
       historical practice, that a &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>) suffix be used instead of
       <b>.orig </b>and some other character instead of the <b>.rej </b>suffix. This was
       rejected because it is not obvious to the user which file is which.
       The suffixes <b>.orig </b>and <b>.rej </b>are clearer and more understandable.

       The <b>−b </b>option has the opposite sense in some historical
       implementations—do not save the <b>.orig </b>file. The default case here is
       not to save the files, making <i>patch</i> behave more consistently with the
       other standard utilities.

       The <b>−w </b>option in early proposals was changed to <b>−l </b>to match
       historical practice.

       The <b>−N </b>option was included because without it, a non-interactive
       application cannot reject previously applied patches. For example, if
       a user is piping the output of <i>diff</i> into the <i>patch</i> utility, and the
       user only wants to patch a file to a newer version non-interactively,
       the <b>−N </b>option is required.

       Changes to the <b>−l </b>option description were proposed to allow matching
       across &lt;newline&gt; characters in addition to just &lt;blank&gt; characters.
       Since this is not historical practice, and since some ambiguities
       could result, it is suggested that future developments in this area
       utilize another option letter, such as <b>−L</b>.

       The <b>−u </b>option of GNU <i>patch</i> has been added, along with support for
       unified context formats.
