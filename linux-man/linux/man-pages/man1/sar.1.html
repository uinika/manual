<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>sar </b>command writes to standard output the contents of selected
       cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting
       system, based on the values in the <i>count</i> and <i>interval</i> parameters,
       writes information the specified number of times spaced at the
       specified intervals in seconds.  If the <i>interval</i> parameter is set to
       zero, the <b>sar </b>command displays the average statistics for the time
       since the system was started. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified
       without the <i>count</i> parameter, then reports are generated continuously.
       The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o
       <i>filename</i> flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If
       <i>filename</i> is omitted, <b>sar </b>uses the standard system activity daily data
       file (see below).  By default all the data available from the kernel
       are saved in the data file.

       The <b>sar </b>command extracts and writes to standard output records
       previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified
       by the -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily
       data file.  It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument
       to <b>sar </b>to display data of that days ago. For example, -1 will point
       at the standard system activity file of yesterday.

       Standard system activity daily data files are named <i>saDD</i> or
       <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the
       current month and DD for the current day. They are the default files
       used by <b>sar </b>only when no filename has been explicitly specified.
       When used to write data to files (with its option -o), <b>sar </b>will use
       <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> if option -D has also been specified, else it will use
       <i>saDD</i>.  When used to display the records previously saved in a file,
       <b>sar </b>will look for the most recent of <i>saDD</i> and <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, and use it.

       Standard system activity daily data files are located in the
       <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify an
       alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a plain file)
       is used with options -f or -o then it will be considered as the
       directory containing the data files.

       Without the -P flag, the <b>sar </b>command reports system-wide (global
       among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages
       for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P
       flag is given, the <b>sar </b>command reports activity which relates to the
       specified processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the <b>sar</b>
       command reports statistics for each individual processor and global
       statistics among all processors.

       You can select information about specific system activities using
       flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
       Specifying the -A flag selects all possible activities.

       The default version of the <b>sar </b>command (CPU utilization report) might
       be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity
       investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU
       utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload
       sampled is CPU-bound.

       If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is
       convenient to specify an output file for the <b>sar </b>command.  Run the
       <b>sar </b>command as a background process. The syntax for this is:

       <b>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</b>

       All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile).
       The data can then be selectively displayed with the <b>sar </b>command using
       the -f option. Set the <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i> parameters to select <i>count</i>
       records at <i>interval</i> second intervals. If the <i>count</i> parameter is not
       set, all the records saved in the file will be selected.  Collection
       of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a
       period of time and determine peak usage hours.

       Note:     The <b>sar </b>command only reports on local activities.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       -A     This is equivalent to specifying <b>-bBdFHqSuvwWy -I SUM -I ALL</b>
              <b>-m ALL -n ALL -r ALL -u ALL -P ALL</b>.

       -B     Report paging statistics.  The following values are displayed:

              <b>pgpgin/s</b>
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk
                     per second.

              <b>pgpgout/s</b>
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk
                     per second.

              <b>fault/s</b>
                     Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the
                     system per second.  This is not a count of page faults
                     that generate I/O, because some page faults can be
                     resolved without I/O.

              <b>majflt/s</b>
                     Number of major faults the system has made per second,
                     those which have required loading a memory page from
                     disk.

              <b>pgfree/s</b>
                     Number of pages placed on the free list by the system
                     per second.

              <b>pgscank/s</b>
                     Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per
                     second.

              <b>pgscand/s</b>
                     Number of pages scanned directly per second.

              <b>pgsteal/s</b>
                     Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache
                     (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its
                     memory demands.

              <b>%vmeff</b>
                     Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the
                     efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then
                     almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive
                     list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less
                     than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some
                     difficulty.  This field is displayed as zero if no
                     pages have been scanned during the interval of time.

       -b     Report I/O and transfer rate statistics.  The following values
              are displayed:

              <b>tps</b>
                     Total number of transfers per second that were issued
                     to physical devices.  A transfer is an I/O request to a
                     physical device. Multiple logical requests can be
                     combined into a single I/O request to the device.  A
                     transfer is of indeterminate size.

              <b>rtps</b>
                     Total number of read requests per second issued to
                     physical devices.

              <b>wtps</b>
                     Total number of write requests per second issued to
                     physical devices.

              <b>bread/s</b>
                     Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks
                     per second.  Blocks are equivalent to sectors and
                     therefore have a size of 512 bytes.

              <b>bwrtn/s</b>
                     Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per
                     second.

       -C     When reading data from a file, tell <b>sar </b>to display comments
              that have been inserted by <b>sadc</b>.

       -D     Use <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> instead of <i>saDD</i> as the standard system activity
              daily data file name. This option works only when used in
              conjunction with option -o to save data to file.

       -d     Report activity for each block device.  When data are
              displayed, the device specification <i>devM-n</i> is generally used
              (DEV column).  M is the major number of the device and n its
              minor number.  Device names may also be pretty-printed if
              option -p is used or persistent device names can be printed if
              option -j is used (see below).  Note that disk activity
              depends on <b>sadc </b>options <b>-S DISK </b>and <b>-S XDISK </b>to be collected.
              The following values are displayed:

              <b>tps</b>
                     Total number of transfers per second that were issued
                     to physical devices.  A transfer is an I/O request to a
                     physical device. Multiple logical requests can be
                     combined into a single I/O request to the device.  A
                     transfer is of indeterminate size.

              <b>rkB/s</b>
                     Number of kilobytes read from the device per second.

              <b>wkB/s</b>
                     Number of kilobytes written to the device per second.

              <b>areq-sz</b>
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests
                     that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              <b>aqu-sz</b>
                     The average queue length of the requests that were
                     issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgqu-sz.

              <b>await</b>
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the
                     time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              <b>svctm</b>
                     The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O
                     requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do
                     not trust this field any more. This field will be
                     removed in a future sysstat version.

              <b>%util</b>
                     Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests
                     were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for
                     the device). Device saturation occurs when this value
                     is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially.
                     But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as
                     RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not
                     reflect their performance limits.

       -e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
              Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is
              18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.  This option
              can be used when data are read from or written to a file
              (options -f or -o).

       -F [ MOUNT ]
              Display statistics for currently mounted filesystems. Pseudo-
              filesystems are ignored. At the end of the report, <b>sar </b>will
              display a summary of all those filesystems.  Use of the <b>MOUNT</b>
              parameter keyword indicates that mountpoint will be reported
              instead of filesystem device.  Note that filesystems
              statistics depend on <b>sadc </b>option <b>-S XDISK </b>to be collected.

              The following values are displayed:

              <b>MBfsfree</b>
                     Total amount a free space in megabytes (including space
                     available only to privileged user).

              <b>MBfsused</b>
                     Total amount of space used in megabytes.

              <b>%fsused</b>
                     Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by a
                     privileged user.

              <b>%ufsused</b>
                     Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by an
                     unprivileged user.

              <b>Ifree</b>
                     Total number of free file nodes in filesystem.

              <b>Iused</b>
                     Total number of file nodes used in filesystem.

              <b>%Iused</b>
                     Percentage of file nodes used in filesystem.

       -f [ filename ]
              Extract records from <i>filename</i> (created by the -o <i>filename</i>
              flag). The default value of the <i>filename</i> parameter is the
              current standard system activity daily data file.  If <i>filename</i>
              is a directory instead of a plain file then it is considered
              as the directory where the standard system activity daily data
              files are located. The -f option is exclusive of the -o
              option.

       -H     Report hugepages utilization statistics.  The following values
              are displayed:

              <b>kbhugfree</b>
                     Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that is not yet
                     allocated.

              <b>kbhugused</b>
                     Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that has been
                     allocated.

              <b>%hugused</b>
                     Percentage of total hugepages memory that has been
                     allocated.

       -h     Display a short help message then exit.

       --human
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1k, 1.23M, etc.)
              The units displayed with this option supersede any other
              default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with
              the metrics.

       -I { int_list | SUM | ALL }
              Report statistics for interrupts.  <i>int_list</i> is a list of
              comma-separated values or range of values (e.g.,
              <b>0-16,35,400-</b>).  The <b>SUM </b>keyword indicates that the total
              number of interrupts received per second is to be displayed.
              The <b>ALL </b>keyword indicates that statistics from all interrupts,
              including potential APIC interrupt sources, are to be
              reported.  Note that interrupt statistics depend on <b>sadc</b>
              option "-S INT" to be collected.

       -i interval
              Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the
              number specified by the <i>interval</i> parameter.

       -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... }

              With the <b>SOCK6 </b>keyword, statistics on sockets in use are
              reported (IPv6).  Note that IPv6 statistics depend on <b>sadc</b>'s
              option "-S IPV6" to be collected.  The following values are
              displayed:

              <b>tcp6sck</b>
                     Number of TCPv6 sockets currently in use.

                     The number of times the flow limit has been reached per
                     second.  Flow limiting is an optional RPS feature that
                     can be used to limit the number of packets queued to
                     the backlog for each flow to a certain amount.  This
                     can help ensure that smaller flows are processed even
                     though much larger flows are pushing packets in.

              With the <b>TCP </b>keyword, statistics about TCPv4 network traffic

              The <b>ALL </b>keyword is equivalent to specifying all the keywords
              above and therefore all the network activities are reported.

       -o [ filename ]
              Save the readings in the file in binary form. Each reading is
              in a separate record. The default value of the <i>filename</i>
              parameter is the current standard system activity daily data
              file.  If <i>filename</i> is a directory instead of a plain file then
              it is considered as the directory where the standard system
              activity daily data files are located.  The -o option is
              exclusive of the -f option.  All the data available from the
              kernel are saved in the file (in fact, <b>sar </b>calls its data
              collector <b>sadc </b>with the option "-S ALL".  See <a href="../man8/sadc.8.html">sadc(8)</a> manual
              page).

       -P { cpu_list | ALL }
              Report per-processor statistics for the specified processor or
              processors.  <i>cpu_list</i> is a list of comma-separated values or
              range of values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>).  Note that processor 0 is
              the first processor, and processor <b>all </b>is the global average
              among all processors.  Specifying the <b>ALL </b>keyword reports
              statistics for each individual processor, and globally for all
              processors.

       -p     Pretty-print device names. Use this option in conjunction with
              option -d.  By default names are printed as <i>devM-n</i> where M and
              n are the major and minor numbers for the device.  Use of this
              option displays the names of the devices as they (should)
              appear in /dev. Name mappings are controlled by
              <i>/etc/sysconfig/sysstat.ioconf</i>.

                     Number of tasks in the task list.

              <b>ldavg-1</b>
                     System load average for the last minute.  The load
                     average is calculated as the average number of runnable
                     or running tasks (R state), and the number of tasks in
                     uninterruptible sleep (D state) over the specified
                     interval.

              <b>ldavg-5</b>
                     System load average for the past 5 minutes.

              <b>ldavg-15</b>
                     System load average for the past 15 minutes.

              <b>blocked</b>
                     Number of tasks currently blocked, waiting for I/O to
                     complete.

       -r [ ALL ]
              Report memory utilization statistics. The <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that all the memory fields should be displayed.  The
              following values may be displayed:

              <b>kbmemfree</b>
                     Amount of free memory available in kilobytes.

              <b>kbavail</b>
                     Estimate of how much memory in kilobytes is available
                     for starting new applications, without swapping.  The
                     estimate takes into account that the system needs some
                     page cache to function well, and that not all
                     reclaimable slab will be reclaimable, due to items
                     being in use. The impact of those factors will vary
                     from system to system.

              <b>kbmemused</b>
                     Amount of used memory in kilobytes. This does not take
                     into account memory used by the kernel itself.

              <b>%memused</b>
                     Percentage of used memory.

              <b>kbbuffers</b>
                     Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in
                     kilobytes.

                     Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in
                     kilobytes.

                     Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for current
                     workload. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap is
                     needed to guarantee that there never is out of memory.

              <b>%commit</b>
                     Percentage of memory needed for current workload in
                     relation to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap).
                     This number may be greater than 100% because the kernel
                     usually overcommits memory.

              <b>kbactive</b>
                     Amount of active memory in kilobytes (memory that has
                     been used more recently and usually not reclaimed
                     unless absolutely necessary).

              <b>kbinact</b>
                     Amount of inactive memory in kilobytes (memory which
                     has been less recently used. It is more eligible to be
                     reclaimed for other purposes).

              <b>kbdirty</b>
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes waiting to get written
                     back to the disk.

              <b>kbanonpg</b>
                     Amount of non-file backed pages in kilobytes mapped
                     into userspace page tables.

              <b>kbslab</b>
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes used by the kernel to
                     cache data structures for its own use.

              <b>kbkstack</b>
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes used for kernel stack
                     space.

              <b>kbpgtbl</b>
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes dedicated to the lowest

                     Amount of memory in kilobytes of used virtual address
                     space.

                     but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed
                     it doesn't need to be swapped out again because it is
                     already in the swap area. This saves I/O).

              <b>%swpcad</b>
                     Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the
                     amount of used swap space.

       -s [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
              Set the starting time of the data, causing the <b>sar </b>command to
              extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time
              specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.  Hours must
              be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used only when
              data are read from a file (option -f).

       --sadc Indicate which data collector is called by <b>sar</b>.  If the data
              collector is sought in PATH then enter "which sadc" to know
              where it is located.

       -t     When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that <b>sar</b>
              should display the timestamps in the original local time of
              the data file creator. Without this option, the <b>sar </b>command
              displays the timestamps in the user's locale time.

       -u [ ALL ]
              Report CPU utilization. The <b>ALL </b>keyword indicates that all the
              CPU fields should be displayed.  The report may show the
              following fields:

              <b>%user</b>
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the user level (application). Note that

              <b>%usr</b>
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the user level (application). Note that
                     this field does NOT include time spent running virtual
                     processors.

              <b>%nice</b>
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while

              <b>%system</b>
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this
                     field includes time spent servicing hardware and
                     software interrupts.

              <b>%sys</b>
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while

                     software interrupts.

              <b>%iowait</b>
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
                     during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              <b>%steal</b>
                     Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the
                     virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
                     another virtual processor.

              <b>%irq</b>
                     Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service
                     hardware interrupts.

              <b>%soft</b>
                     Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service
                     software interrupts.

              <b>%guest</b>
                     Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a

                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and
                     the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any
              activity at all (0.00 for every field) is a disabled (offline)
              processor.

       -V     Print version number then exit.

       -v     Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables.  The
              following values are displayed:

       The <b>sar </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       S_COLORS
              When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the
              terminal.  Possible values for this variable are <i>never</i>, <i>always</i>
              or <i>auto</i> (the latter is the default).

              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other
              color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind
              of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates
              different ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-separated
              list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>C=33;22:H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:R=31;22:Z=34;22</b>.
              Supported capabilities are:

              <b>C=     </b>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for comments
                     inserted in the binary daily data files.

              <b>H=     </b>SGR substring for percentage values greater than or
                     equal to 75%.

              <b>I=     </b>SGR substring for item names or values (eg. network
                     interfaces, CPU number...)

              <b>M=     </b>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from
                     50% to 75%.

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>R=     </b>SGR substring for restart messages.

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values.

       S_TIME_DEF_TIME
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>UTC </b>then <b>sar </b>will
              save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in
              local time).  <b>sar </b>will also use UTC time instead of local time
              to determine the current daily data file located in the
              <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory. This variable may be useful for servers
              with users located across several timezones.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the current
              locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report
              header.  The <b>sar </b>command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-
              MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO
              8601 format.

       <b>sar -u 2 5</b>
              Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are
              displayed.

       <b>sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10</b>
              Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are
              displayed.  Data are stored in a file called <i>int14.file</i>.

       <b>sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16</b>
              Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data file
              'sa16'.

       <b>sar -A</b>
              Display all the statistics saved in current daily data file.

       <i>/proc</i> filesystem must be mounted for the <b>sar </b>command to work.

       All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on the
       kernel version used.  <b>sar </b>assumes that you are using at least a 2.6
       kernel.

              The standard system activity daily data files and their
              default location.  YYYY stands for the current year, MM for
              the current month and DD for the current day.

       <i>/proc</i> and <i>/sys</i> contain various files with system statistics.
