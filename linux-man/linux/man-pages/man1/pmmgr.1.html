<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>pmmgr </b>manages a collection of PCP daemons for a set of discovered
       local and remote hosts running the Performance Metrics Collection
       Daemon (PMCD), according to zero or more configuration directories.
       It keeps a matching set of <b>pmie</b>, <b>pmlogger</b>, <b>pmrep </b>and other daemons
       running, and their archives/logs merged/rotated.  It provides an
       alternative to the default <b>cron</b>(1)-based management scripts for
       <b>pmlogger </b>and <b>pmie</b>.

       <b>pmmgr </b>is largely self-configuring and perseveres despite most run-
       time errors.  <b>pmmgr </b>runs in the foreground until interrupted.  When
       signaled, it will stop its running daemons before exiting.

       A description of the command line options specific to <b>pmmgr </b>follows:

       <b>-c   </b><i>directory</i> adds a given configuration directory to <b>pmmgr</b>.  <b>pmmgr</b>
            can supervise multiple different configurations at the same
            time, so this option may be repeated.  Errors in the
            configuration may be noted to standard error, but <b>pmmgr </b>will
            fill in missing information with built-in defaults.  The default
            directory is <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmmgr</i>

       <b>-p   </b><i>polling-interval</i> sets the host-discovery polling interval to the
            given number of seconds.  The default is 60.  Daemons for a
            particular target host will be restarted no more frequently than
            this interval.  There may be a short-lived thread inside <b>pmmgr</b>
            for startup and shutdown of each daemon for each target host.

       <b>-l   </b><i>log-file</i> redirects standard output and error to the given log
            file, which is created anew

       <b>-v   </b>adds more verbose tracing to standard output.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION" href="#CONFIGURATION"></a>CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       A <b>pmmgr </b>configuration identifies which hosts should be monitored,
       which daemons should be maintained for them, and what options those
       daemons should be run with.  <b>pmmgr </b>uses a small number of files in a
       configuration directory, instead of lines in a text file.  The
       individual files carry zero or more lines of 100% pure configuration
       text, and no comments.  (If desired, a configuration may be commented
       upon with any other file, such as a free-form README.)

   <b>TARGET SELECTION</b>
       This set of configuration files identifies where <b>pmmgr </b>should search
       for <b>pmcd </b>instances, how to uniquely identify them, and where state
       such as log files should be kept for each.  Ideally, a persistent and
       unique host-id string is computed for each potential target pmcd from
       specified metric values.  This host-id is also used as a subdirectory
       name for locating daemon data.

       <i>hostid-static</i>
              This file contains a single line specifying the static string
              that should be used for the host-id value.  Specifying a value
              in this file overrides the <i>hostid-metrics</i> file specified
              below.  It should be noted that using this option will cause
              all target pmcds to be assigned the same hostid.  Thus, this
              is useful in monitoring single hosts, or if each monitored
              host has its own configuration directory.

       <i>hostid-metrics</i>
              This file contains one or more lines of metric specifications
              in the format accepted by <i>pmParseMetricSpec</i>.  Metrics without
              instance specifiers mean all instances of that metric.  These
              are used to generate the <i>unique</i> host-id string for each <b>pmcd</b>
              server that <b>pmmgr </b>discovers.  Upon discovery, all the
              metrics/instances named are queried, string values fetched,
              and normalized/concatenated into a single hyphenated printable
              string.  The default is the single metric <b>pmcd.hostname</b>, which
              is sufficient if all the hosts discovered have unique
              hostname(2).  If they don't, you should add other pcp metric
              specifications to set them apart at your site.  The more you
              add, the longer the host-id string, but the more likely that
              accidental duplication is prevented.

       However, it may be desirable for a host-id to also be <i>persistent</i>, so
       that if the target host goes offline and later returns, the new host-
       id matches the previous one, because then old and new histories can
       be joined.  This argues against using metrics whose values vary from
       boot to boot.

       Some candidate metrics to consider: <i>network.interface.hw_addr</i>,
       <i>network.interface.inet_addr["eth0"]</i>, <i>network.interface.ipv6_addr</i>,
       <i>kernel.uname.nodename</i>

       <i>log-directory</i>
              This file contains the path of a directory beneath which the
              per-host-id subdirectories are to be created by <b>pmmgr</b>.  If it
              is not a full path, it is implicitly relative to the
              configuration directory itself.  The default is
              <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmmgr/</b>.

       <i>target-host</i>
              This file contains one or more lines containing <b>pmcd </b>host
              specifications, as described on the <i>PCPintro</i>(1) manual page.
              Each poll interval, <b>pmmgr </b>will attempt to make a brief
              <i>pmNewContext</i> connection to the host to check liveness.  It is
              not a problem if more than one specification for the same host
              is listed, because the host-id processing eliminates
              duplicates, and chooses an arbitrary specification among them.
              The default is to target pmcd at <b>local:</b>.

       <i>target-discovery</i>
              This file contains one or more lines containing specifications
              for the <i>pmDiscoverServices</i> PMAPI call, each of which may map
              onto a fluctuating set of local or remote pmcd servers.  Each
              poll interval, <b>pmmgr </b>will attempt to rerun discovery with all
              of the given specifications.  Again, it is not a problem if
              more than one specification matches the same actual pmcd: one
              confirmed access path is arbitrarily selected.  The default is
              to do <b>no discovery</b>.  Consider including <i>avahi,timeout=5</i> to
              rely in pmcd self-announcements on the local network
              (searching for up to five seconds each time).  Consider
              including <i>probe=192.168.1.0/24</i> to quickly scan the given IP
              address range.

       <i>subtarget-containers</i>
              If this file exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will scan each host that is found
              for running containers.  For each running container, it will
              create independent subtargets for running requested daemons.
              The host-id string for these subtargets is the host's host-id
              string, followed by a double-hyphen, then the full unique
              container instance-name string.

       <i>target-threads</i>
              This file contains a limit on the number of concurrent threads
              that analyze potential target pmcds for their hostids and/or
              containers.  The default is <b>a few dozen threads per CPU core</b>,
              if known.  Set this to zero if remote pmcds should be analyzed
              sequentially.  A small number of threads is not a good idea if
              any potential target pmcds are unreachable, since
              $PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT may be several seconds long each.

       <i>log-subdirectory-gc</i>
              This file may contain a time interval specification as per the
              <a href="pcpintro.1-2.html">PCPintro(1)</a> manual page.  All subdirectories of the
              log-directory are presumed to contain data for <b>pmmgr</b>-monitored
              servers.  Those that have not been modified in at least that
              long, and not associated with a currently monitored target,
              are deleted entirely.  This value should be longer than the
              longest interval that <b>pmmgr </b>normally recreates archives (such
              as due to <b>pmmgr </b>restarts, and <b>pmlogmerge </b>intervals).  The
              default value is <i>90days</i>.

   <b>PMLOGGER CONFIGURATION</b>
       This group of configuration options controls a <b>pmlogger </b>daemon for
       each host.  This may include generating its configuration, and
       managing its archives.

       <i>pmlogger</i>
              If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a
              <b>pmlogger </b>daemon for each targeted host.  This file contains
              one line of additional space-separated options for the <b>pmie</b>
              daemon.  (<b>pmmgr </b>already adds -h, -f, -r, -l, and perhaps -c.)
              The default is to maintain <b>no pmlogger </b>(and no other
              configuration in this section is processed).

       <i>pmlogger-timefmt</i>
              Specify a time format to use in the archive-* name for
              <b>pmlogger </b>generated archives. The default is "%Y%m%d.%H%M%S".
              Expected to be in <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> format.

       <i>pmlogconf</i>
              If and only if this file exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will run <b>pmlogconf </b>to
              generate a configuration file for each target <b>pmcd</b>.  The file
              contains one line of space-separated additional options for
              the <b>pmlogconf </b>program.  <b>pmlogconf</b>'s generated output file will
              be stored under the log-directory/hostid subdirectory.  (<b>pmmgr</b>
              already adds -c, -r, and -h.)  The default is <b>no pmlogconf</b>, so
              instead, the <b>pmlogger </b>file above should probably contain a -c
              option, to specify a fixed <b>pmlogger </b>configuration.

   <b>ARCHIVE LOG MANAGEMENT</b>
       Default <b>pmlogger </b>configurations can collect tens of megabytes of data
       per day (possibly split into multiple archives), per target host.  If
       your disk space is less than infinite, or archive-splitting unwieldy,
       this should be managed.  In the default, unmanaged case, the system
       administrator is responsible for managing the individual <i>archive-*</i>
       files from the per-host logging subdirectories.  <b>pmmgr </b>offers several
       other options, each representing different performance and usability
       tradeoffs.

   <b>ARCHIVE LOG MANAGEMENT - pmlogmerge</b>
       This style of archive log management regularly creates a single
       merged archive from prior archives for each target host, in effect
       lopping off old data and appending the new.  A single merged archive
       can be relatively large (defaults to approximately 100-400 MB per
       host), and puts a corresponding I/O load on storage, but is most
       convenient for a detailed long-timeframe analysis.  Once <b>pmlogger </b>is
       restarted, it always creates a new archive, so in the steady state,
       there will be one merged archive of recent history, and one current
       archive being written-to by <b>pmlogger</b>.

       <i>pmlogmerge</i>
              If this file exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will run <b>pmlogextract </b>to
              periodically merge together preexisting log archives for each
              target pmcd into a single large one.  Then, the preexisting
              log archives are deleted (including any prior merged ones).
              This configuration file may contain a time interval
              specification as per the <a href="pcpintro.1-2.html">PCPintro(1)</a> manual page, representing
              the period after which <b>pmlogger </b>should be temporarily stopped,
              and archives merged.  It represents the maximum amount of time
              that the merged archive <i>lags</i> the present time.  The default is
              <i>24hours</i>.

       <i>pmlogmerge-granular</i>
              If this file also exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will merge only a subset of
              preexisting log archives into the new one, instead of all of
              them, so as to approximate a granular, aligned set of merged
              archives.  The subset chosen corresponds to the previous time
              interval specified by the <i>pmlogmerge</i> control file.  The
              default is <b>no granularity</b>.

       <i>pmlogcheck-corrupt-gc</i>
              Before archives are considered for merging, they are processed
              through <b>pmlogcheck </b>to check for corruption.  In the unlikely
              case of a problem, such archives are renamed out of the way
              (named "corrupt-*"), and retained up to a limited time.  This
              file specifies how long.  If this file exists, it the time
              interval it contains is the maximum age.  The default is
              <b>90days</b>.  To store corrupt archives indefinitely, set this to a
              large quantity like "99999weeks".

       <i>pmlogmerge-rewrite</i>
              If this file exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will run <b>pmlogrewrite -i </b>(plus any
              other options listed in this file) on each input archive
              before merging it.  This will naturally require more disk I/O.
              The default is <b>no rewriting</b>.

       <i>pmlogmerge-retain</i>
              <b>pmmgr </b>reduces/deletes any original-resolution archives after a
              time period specified by this file, as measured by the file
              mtime.  The period will also be passed to <b>pmlogextract </b>as a
              negative parameter to <i>-S</i>.  The default is <i>14days</i>.  To store
              archives indefinitely, set this to a large quantity like
              "99999weeks".

       <i>pmlogreduce</i>
              If this file exists, then prior to removing archives that
              expire past the <i>pmlogmerge-retain</i> period, they are processed
              with <b>pmlogreduce </b>to create reduced archives (named <b>reduced-*</b>).
              If the file contains space-separated options, they are passed
              onto pmlogreduce.  (By default, pmlogreduce down-samples to a
              600-second interval.)

       <i>pmlogreduce-retain</i>
              If this file exists, then reduced archives (identified by the
              <b>reduced-* </b>pattern) are deleted after a time period specified
              by this file, as measured from the file mtime.  Since this
              time is likely that of the pmlogreduce run, the total
              retention time will be approximately the pmlogmerge-retain
              time <b>plus </b>the pmlogreduce-retain time.  The default is <b>90days</b>.
              To store reduced archives indefinitely, set this to a large
              quantity like "99999weeks".

   <b>PMIE CONFIGURATION</b>
       This group of configuration options controls a <b>pmie </b>daemon for each
       host.  This may include generating a custom configuration.

       <i>pmie</i>   If and only if this file exists, pmmgr will maintain a <b>pmie</b>
              daemon for each targeted <b>pmcd</b>.  This file contains one line of
              additional space-separated options for the <b>pmie </b>daemon.
              (pmmgr already adds -h, -f, -l, and perhaps -c.)  The default
              is to maintain <b>no pmie </b>(and no other configuration in this
              section is processed).

       <i>pmieconf</i>
              If and only if this file exists, <b>pmmgr </b>will run <b>pmieconf </b>to
              generate a configuration file for each target <b>pmcd</b>.  The file
              contains one line of space-separated additional options for
              the <b>pmieconf </b>program.  <b>pmieconf</b>- generated output file will be
              stored under the log-directory/hostid subdirectory.  (<b>pmmgr</b>
              already adds -F, -c, and -f.)  The default is <b>no pmieconf</b>, so
              instead, the <i>pmie</i> file above should probably contain a -c
              option, to specify a fixed <b>pmie configuration.</b>

   <b>MONITOR DAEMON MANAGEMENT</b>
       <b>pmmgr </b>may be used to invoke arbitrary PCP client programs for each
       target <b>pmcd</b>.  This can enable automated invocation of reporting or
       relaying tools, such as <b>pmrep</b>, <b>pcp2graphite </b>or <b>pcp2influxdb </b>without
       needing a specialized system service.

       <i>monitor</i>
              If this file exists, then for each line in this file, a new
              background process will be invoked.  (It is restarted if it
              exits.)  The line specifies the beginning of the command line
              (including the program name); <b>pmmgr </b>appends a -h HOSTSPEC, and
              arranges to collect the standard output and standard error
              into separate <b>monitor-NN.out </b>and <b>monitor-NN.err </b>files under
              the log directory.

       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to parametrize
       the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the
       file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these variables.
       The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to specify an alternative
       configuration file, as described in <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
