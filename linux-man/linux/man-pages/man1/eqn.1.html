<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This manual page describes the GNU version of <b>eqn</b>, which is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  <b>eqn </b>compiles descriptions of
       equations embedded within <b>troff </b>input files into commands that are
       understood by <b>troff</b>.  Normally, it should be invoked using the <b>-e</b>
       option of <b>groff</b>.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The
       output of GNU <b>eqn </b>cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must be
       processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line,
       the standard input is read.  A filename of <b>- </b>causes the standard
       input to be read.

       <b>eqn </b>searches for the file <b>eqnrc </b>in the directories given with the <b>-M</b>
       option first, then in <b>/usr/local/lib/groff/site-tmac</b>,
       <b>/usr/local/share/groff/site-tmac</b>, and finally in the standard macro
       directory <b>/usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac</b>.  If it exists, <b>eqn</b>
       processes it before the other input files.  The <b>-R </b>option prevents
       this.

       GNU <b>eqn </b>does not provide the functionality of neqn: it does not
       support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work
       adequately for very simple input).

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and
       its parameter.

       <b>-d</b><i>xy</i>   Specify delimiters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> for the left and right end,
              respectively, of in-line equations.  Any <b>delim </b>statements in
              the source file overrides this.

       <b>-C     </b>Recognize <b>.EQ </b>and <b>.EN </b>even when followed by a character other
              than space or newline.  Also, the statement ‘<b>delim on</b>’ is not
              handled specially.

       <b>-N     </b>Don't allow newlines within delimiters.  This option allows
              <b>eqn </b>to recover better from missing closing delimiters.

       <b>-v     </b>Print the version number.

       <b>-r     </b>Only one size reduction.

       <b>-m</b><i>n</i>    The minimum point-size is <i>n</i>.  <b>eqn </b>does not reduce the size of
              subscripts or superscripts to a smaller size than <i>n</i>.

       <b>-T</b><i>name</i> The output is for device <i>name</i>.  Normally, the only effect of
              this is to define a macro <i>name</i> with a value of <b>1</b>; <b>eqnrc </b>uses
              this to provide definitions appropriate for the output device.
              However, if the specified device is “MathML”, the output is
              MathML markup rather than troff commands, and <b>eqnrc </b>is not
              loaded at all.  The default output device is <b>ps</b>.

       <b>-M</b><i>dir</i>  Search <i>dir</i> for <b>eqnrc </b>before the default directories.

       <b>-R     </b>Don't load <b>eqnrc</b>.

       <b>-f</b><i>F</i>    This is equivalent to a <b>gfont </b><i>F</i> command.

       <b>-s</b><i>n</i>    This is equivalent to a <b>gsize </b><i>n</i> command.  This option is
              deprecated.  <b>eqn </b>normally sets equations at whatever the
              current point size is when the equation is encountered.

       <b>-p</b><i>n</i>    This says that subscripts and superscripts should be <i>n</i> points
              smaller than the surrounding text.  This option is deprecated.
              Normally <b>eqn </b>sets subscripts and superscripts at 70% of the
              size of the surrounding text.

<h2><a id="USAGE" href="#USAGE"></a>USAGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Only the differences between GNU <b>eqn </b>and Unix eqn are described here.

       GNU <b>eqn </b>emits Presentation MathML output when invoked with the
       <b>-T MathML </b>option.

       GNU eqn sets the input token <b>"..."  </b>as three periods or low dots,
       rather than the three centered dots of classic eqn.  To get three
       centered dots, write <b>cdots </b>or <b>cdot cdot cdot</b>.

       Most of the new features of the GNU <b>eqn </b>input language are based on
       TeX.  There are some references to the differences between TeX and
       GNU <b>eqn </b>below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.

   <b>Controlling delimiters</b>
       If not in compatibility mode, <b>eqn </b>recognizes

              <b>delim on</b>

       to restore the delimiters which have been previously disabled with a
       call to ‘<b>delim off</b>’.  If delimiters haven't been specified, the call
       has no effect.

   <b>Automatic spacing</b>
       <b>eqn </b>gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the
       spacing between components using that type.  Possible types are:

              ordinary an ordinary character such as ‘1’ or ‘
                           <i>x</i>’;

              operator     a large operator such as ‘Σ’;

              binary       a binary operator such as ‘+’;

              relation     a relation such as ‘=’;

              opening      a opening bracket such as ‘(’;

              closing      a closing bracket such as ‘)’;

              punctuation  a punctuation character such as ‘,;

              inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

              suppress spacing
                           that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       <b>type </b><i>t e</i>
              This yields an equation component that contains <i>e</i> but that has
              type <i>t</i>, where <i>t</i> is one of the types mentioned above.  For
              example, <b>times </b>is defined as

                     <b>type "binary" \(mu</b>

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but quoting
              protects from macro expansion.

       <b>chartype </b><i>t text</i>
              Unquoted groups of characters are split up into individual
              characters, and the type of each character is looked up; this
              changes the type that is stored for each character; it says
              that the characters in <i>text</i> from now on have type <i>t</i>.  For
              example,

                     <b>chartype "punctuation" .,;:</b>

              would make the characters ‘.,;:’ have type punctuation
              whenever they subsequently appeared in an equation.  The
              type <i>t</i> can also be <b>letter </b>or <b>digit</b>; in these cases <b>chartype</b>
              changes the font type of the characters.  See the <b>Fonts</b>
              subsection.

   <b>New primitives</b>
       <b>big </b><i>e</i>  Enlarges the expression it modifies; intended to have
              semantics like CSS ‘large’.  In troff output, the point size
              is increased by 5; in MathML output, the expression uses

                     &lt;mstyle mathsize='big'&gt;

       <i>e1</i> <b>smallover </b><i>e2</i>
              This is similar to <b>over</b>; <b>smallover </b>reduces the size of <i>e1</i> and
              <i>e2</i>; it also puts less vertical space between <i>e1</i> or <i>e2</i> and the
              fraction bar.  The <b>over </b>primitive corresponds to the TeX <b>\over</b>
              primitive in display styles; <b>smallover </b>corresponds to <b>\over </b>in
              non-display styles.

       <b>vcenter </b><i>e</i>
              This vertically centers <i>e</i> about the math axis.  The math axis
              is the vertical position about which characters such as ‘+cq
              and ‘−’ are centered; also it is the vertical position used
              for the bar of fractions.  For example, <b>sum </b>is defined as

                     <b>{ type "operator" vcenter size +5 \(*S }</b>

              (Note that vcenter is silently ignored when generating
              MathML.)

       <i>e1</i> <b>accent </b><i>e2</i>
              This sets <i>e2</i> as an accent over <i>e1</i>.  <i>e2</i> is assumed to be at the
              correct height for a lowercase letter; <i>e2</i> is moved down
              according to whether <i>e1</i> is taller or shorter than a lowercase
              letter.  For example, <b>hat </b>is defined as

                     <b>accent { "^" }</b>

              <b>dotdot</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>vec</b>, and <b>dyad </b>are also defined using the
              <b>accent </b>primitive.

       <i>e1</i> <b>uaccent </b><i>e2</i>
              This sets <i>e2</i> as an accent under <i>e1</i>.  <i>e2</i> is assumed to be at
              the correct height for a character without a descender; <i>e2</i> is
              moved down if <i>e1</i> has a descender.  <b>utilde </b>is pre-defined using
              <b>uaccent </b>as a tilde accent below the baseline.

       <b>split "</b><i>text</i><b>"</b>
              This has the same effect as simply

                     <i>text</i>

              but <i>text</i> is not subject to macro expansion because it is
              quoted; <i>text</i> is split up and the spacing between individual
              characters is adjusted.

       <b>nosplit </b><i>text</i>
              This has the same effect as

                     <b>"</b><i>text</i><b>"</b>

              but because <i>text</i> is not quoted it is subject to macro expan‐
              sion; <i>text</i> is not split up and the spacing between individual
              characters is not adjusted.

       <i>e</i> <b>opprime</b>
              This is a variant of <b>prime </b>that acts as an operator on <i>e</i>.  It
              produces a different result from <b>prime </b>in a case such as
              <b>A opprime sub 1</b>: with <b>opprime </b>the <b>1 </b>is tucked under the prime
              as a subscript to the <b>A </b>(as is conventional in mathematical
              typesetting), whereas with <b>prime </b>the <b>1 </b>is a subscript to the
              prime character.  The precedence of <b>opprime </b>is the same as
              that of <b>bar </b>and <b>under</b>, which is higher than that of everything
              except <b>accent </b>and <b>uaccent</b>.  In unquoted text a <b>' </b>that is not
              the first character is treated like <b>opprime</b>.

       <b>special </b><i>text e</i>
              This constructs a new object from <i>e</i> using a <a href="troff.1.html">troff(1)</a> macro
              named <i>text</i>.  When the macro is called, the string <b>0s </b>contains
              the output for <i>e</i>, and the number registers <b>0w</b>, <b>0h</b>, <b>0d</b>, <b>0skern</b>,
              and <b>0skew </b>contain the width, height, depth, subscript kern,
              and skew of <i>e</i>.  (The <i>subscript kern</i> of an object says how much
              a subscript on that object should be tucked in; the <i>skew</i> of an
              object says how far to the right of the center of the object
              an accent over the object should be placed.)  The macro must
              modify <b>0s </b>so that it outputs the desired result with its ori‐
              gin at the current point, and increase the current horizontal
              position by the width of the object.  The number registers
              must also be modified so that they correspond to the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted a construct that ‘cancels’ an
              expression by drawing a diagonal line through it.

                     <b>.EQ</b>
                     <b>define cancel 'special Ca'</b>
                     <b>.EN</b>
                     <b>.de Ca</b>
                     <b>.  ds 0s \</b>
                     <b>\Z'\\*(0s'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0du'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0hu'</b>
                     <b>..</b>

              Then you could cancel an expression <i>e</i> with <b>cancel { </b><i>e</i> <b>}</b>

              Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box round an
              expression:

                     <b>.EQ</b>
                     <b>define box 'special Bx'</b>
                     <b>.EN</b>
                     <b>.de Bx</b>
                     <b>.  ds 0s \</b>
                     <b>\Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\</b>
                     <b>\Z'\</b>
                     <b>\v'\\n(0du+1n'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\</b>
                     <b>\D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n'\</b>
                     <b>'\</b>
                     <b>\h'\\n(0wu+2n'</b>
                     <b>.  nr 0w +2n</b>
                     <b>.  nr 0d +1n</b>
                     <b>.  nr 0h +1n</b>
                     <b>..</b>

       <b>space </b><i>n</i>
              A positive value of the integer <i>n</i> (in hundredths of an em)
              sets the vertical spacing before the equation, a negative
              value sets the spacing after the equation, replacing the
              default values.  This primitive provides an interface to
              <b>groff</b>'s <b>\x </b>escape (but with opposite sign).

              This keyword has no effect if the equation is part of a <b>pic</b>
              picture.

   <b>Extended primitives</b>
       <b>col </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>ccol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>lcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>rcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>pile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>cpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>lpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
       <b>rpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b><i>...</i> <b>}</b>
              The integer value <i>n</i> (in hundredths of an em) increases the
              vertical spacing between rows, using <b>groff</b>'s <b>\x </b>escape (the
              value has no effect in MathML mode).  Negative values are pos‐
              sible but have no effect.  If there is more than a single
              value given in a matrix, the biggest one is used.

   <b>Customization</b>
       When <b>eqn </b>is generating troff markup, the appearance of equations is
       controlled by a large number of parameters.  They have no effect when
       generating MathML mode, which pushes typesetting and fine motions
       downstream to a MathML rendering engine.  These parameters can be set
       using the <b>set </b>command.

       <b>set </b><i>p n</i>
              This sets parameter <i>p</i> to value <i>n</i>; <i>n</i> is an integer.  For exam‐
              ple,

                     <b>set x_height 45</b>

              says that <b>eqn </b>should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.

              Possible parameters are as follows.  Values are in units of
              hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated.  These descrip‐
              tions are intended to be expository rather than definitive.

              <b>minimum_size</b>
                     <b>eqn </b>doesn't set anything at a smaller point-size than
                     this.  The value is in points.

              <b>fat_offset</b>
                     The <b>fat </b>primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting
                     two copies of the equation horizontally offset by this
                     amount.  This parameter is not used in MathML mode;
                     instead, fat text uses

                            &lt;mstyle mathvariant='double-struck'&gt;

              <b>over_hang</b>
                     A fraction bar is longer by twice this amount than the
                     maximum of the widths of the numerator and denominator;
                     in other words, it overhangs the numerator and denomi‐
                     nator by at least this amount.

              <b>accent_width</b>
                     When <b>bar </b>or <b>under </b>is applied to a single character, the
                     line is this long.  Normally, <b>bar </b>or <b>under </b>produces a
                     line whose length is the width of the object to which
                     it applies; in the case of a single character, this
                     tends to produce a line that looks too long.

              <b>delimiter_factor</b>
                     Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and <b>right</b>
                     primitives have a combined height and depth of at least
                     this many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by
                     which the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose
                     extends away from the axis.

              <b>delimiter_shortfall</b>
                     Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and <b>right</b>
                     primitives have a combined height and depth not less
                     than the difference of twice the maximum amount by
                     which the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose
                     extends away from the axis and this amount.

              <b>null_delimiter_space</b>
                     This much horizontal space is inserted on each side of
                     a fraction.

              <b>script_space</b>
                     The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased
                     by this amount.

              <b>thin_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted after
                     punctuation characters.

              <b>medium_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on
                     either side of binary operators.

              <b>thick_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on
                     either side of relations.

              <b>x_height</b>
                     The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such
                     as ‘x’.

              <b>axis_height</b>
                     The height above the baseline of the center of charac‐
                     ters such as ‘+’ and ‘−’.  It is important that this
                     value is correct for the font you are using.

              <b>default_rule_thickness</b>
                     This should set to the thickness of the <b>\(ru </b>character,
                     or the thickness of horizontal lines produced with the
                     <b>\D </b>escape sequence.

              <b>num1   </b>The <b>over </b>command shifts up the numerator by at least
                     this amount.

              <b>num2   </b>The <b>smallover </b>command shifts up the numerator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>denom1 </b>The <b>over </b>command shifts down the denominator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>denom2 </b>The <b>smallover </b>command shifts down the denominator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>sup1   </b>Normally superscripts are shifted up by at least this
                     amount.

              <b>sup2   </b>Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or
                     numerators of <b>smallover </b>fractions are shifted up by at
                     least this amount.  This is usually less than sup1.

              <b>sup3   </b>Superscripts within denominators or square roots or
                     subscripts or lower limits are shifted up by at least
                     this amount.  This is usually less than sup2.

              <b>sub1   </b>Subscripts are normally shifted down by at least this
                     amount.

              <b>sub2   </b>When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the
                     subscript is shifted down by at least this amount.

              <b>sup_drop</b>
                     The baseline of a superscript is no more than this much
                     amount below the top of the object on which the super‐
                     script is set.

              <b>sub_drop</b>
                     The baseline of a subscript is at least this much below
                     the bottom of the object on which the subscript is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing1</b>
                     The baseline of an upper limit is at least this much
                     above the top of the object on which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing2</b>
                     The baseline of a lower limit is at least this much
                     below the bottom of the object on which the limit is
                     set.

              <b>big_op_spacing3</b>
                     The bottom of an upper limit is at least this much
                     above the top of the object on which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing4</b>
                     The top of a lower limit is at least this much below
                     the bottom of the object on which the limit is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing5</b>
                     This much vertical space is added above and below lim‐
                     its.

              <b>baseline_sep</b>
                     The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix are nor‐
                     mally this far apart.  In most cases this should be
                     equal to the sum of <b>num1 </b>and <b>denom1</b>.

              <b>shift_down</b>
                     The midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom
                     baseline in a matrix or pile is shifted down by this
                     much from the axis.  In most cases this should be equal
                     to <b>axis_height</b>.

              <b>column_sep</b>
                     This much space is added between columns in a matrix.

              <b>matrix_side_sep</b>
                     This much space is added at each side of a matrix.

              <b>draw_lines</b>
                     If this is non-zero, lines are drawn using the <b>\D</b>
                     escape sequence, rather than with the <b>\l </b>escape
                     sequence and the <b>\(ru </b>character.

              <b>body_height</b>
                     The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds
                     this is added as extra space before the line containing
                     the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The default value is 85.

              <b>body_depth</b>
                     The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds
                     this is added as extra space after the line containing
                     the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The default value is 35.

              <b>nroff  </b>If this is non-zero, then <b>ndefine </b>behaves like <b>define</b>
                     and <b>tdefine </b>is ignored, otherwise <b>tdefine </b>behaves like
                     <b>define </b>and <b>ndefine </b>is ignored.  The default value is 0
                     (This is typically changed to 1 by the <b>eqnrc </b>file for
                     the <b>ascii</b>, <b>latin1</b>, <b>utf8</b>, and <b>cp1047 </b>devices.)

              A more precise description of the role of many of these param‐
              eters can be found in Appendix H of <i>The TeXbook</i>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, <b>$</b><i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is between 1
       and 9, is replaced by the <i>n-th</i> argument if the macro is called with
       arguments; if there are fewer than <i>n</i> arguments, it is replaced by
       nothing.  A word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the
       word before the left parenthesis has been defined using the <b>define</b>
       command is recognized as a macro call with arguments; characters fol‐
       lowing the left parenthesis up to a matching right parenthesis are
       treated as comma-separated arguments; commas inside nested parenthe‐
       ses do not terminate an argument.

       <b>sdefine </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              This is like the <b>define </b>command, but <i>name</i> is not recognized if
              called with arguments.

       <b>include "</b><i>file</i><b>"</b>
       <b>copy "</b><i>file</i><b>"</b>
              Include the contents of <i>file</i> (<b>include </b>and <b>copy </b>are synonyms).
              Lines of <i>file</i> beginning with <b>.EQ </b>or <b>.EN </b>are ignored.

       <b>ifdef </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              If <i>name</i> has been defined by <b>define </b>(or has been automatically
              defined because <i>name</i> is the output device) process <i>anything</i>;
              otherwise ignore <i>anything</i>.  <i>X</i> can be any character not appear‐
              ing in <i>anything</i>.

       <b>undef </b><i>name</i>
              Remove definition of <i>name</i>, making it undefined.

       Besides the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are
       available: <b>Alpha</b>, <b>Beta</b>, ..., <b>Omega </b>(this is the same as <b>ALPHA</b>, <b>BETA</b>,
       ..., <b>OMEGA</b>), <b>ldots </b>(three dots on the base line), and <b>dollar</b>.

   <b>Fonts</b>
       <b>eqn </b>normally uses at least two fonts to set an equation: an italic
       font for letters, and a roman font for everything else.  The existing
       <b>gfont </b>command changes the font that is used as the italic font.  By
       default this is <b>I</b>.  The font that is used as the roman font can be
       changed using the new <b>grfont </b>command.

       <b>grfont </b><i>f</i>
              Set the roman font to <i>f</i>.

       The <b>italic </b>primitive uses the current italic font set by <b>gfont</b>; the
       <b>roman </b>primitive uses the current roman font set by <b>grfont</b>.  There is
       also a new <b>gbfont </b>command, which changes the font used by the <b>bold</b>
       primitive.  If you only use the <b>roman</b>, <b>italic </b>and <b>bold </b>primitives to
       changes fonts within an equation, you can change all the fonts used
       by your equations just by using <b>gfont</b>, <b>grfont </b>and <b>gbfont </b>commands.

       You can control which characters are treated as letters (and there‐
       fore set in italics) by using the <b>chartype </b>command described above.
       A type of <b>letter </b>causes a character to be set in italic type.  A type
       of <b>digit </b>causes a character to be set in roman type.

<h2><a id="MATHML_MODE_LIMITATIONS" href="#MATHML_MODE_LIMITATIONS"></a>MATHML MODE LIMITATIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       MathML is designed on the assumption that it cannot know the exact
       physical characteristics of the media and devices on which it will be
       rendered.  It does not support fine control of motions and sizes to
       the same degree troff does.  Thus:

       *      <b>eqn </b>parameters have no effect on the generated MathML.

       *      The <b>special, up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>fwd</b>, and <b>back </b>operations cannot be
              implemented, and yield a MathML ‘&lt;merror&gt;’ message instead.

       *      The <b>vcenter </b>keyword is silently ignored, as centering on the
              math axis is the MathML default.

       *      Characters that <b>eqn </b>over troff sets extra large – notably the
              integral sign – may appear too small and need to have their
              ‘&lt;mstyle&gt;’ wrappers adjusted by hand.

       As in its troff mode, <b>eqn </b>in MathML mode leaves the <b>.EQ </b>and <b>.EN</b>
       delimiters in place for displayed equations, but emits no explicit
       delimiters around inline equations.  They can, however, be recognized
       as strings that begin with ‘&lt;math&gt;’ and end with ‘&lt;/math&gt;’ and do not
       cross line boundaries.

       See the <b>BUGS </b>section for translation limits specific to <b>eqn</b>.

<h2><a id="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Inline equations are set at the point size that is current at the
       beginning of the input line.

       In MathML mode, the <b>mark </b>and <b>lineup </b>features don't work.  These
       could, in theory, be implemented with ‘&lt;maligngroup&gt;’ elements.

       In MathML mode, each digit of a numeric literal gets a separate ‘&lt;mn&gt;
       &lt;/mn&gt;’ pair, and decimal points are tagged with ‘&lt;mo&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;’.  This is
       allowed by the specification, but inefficient.
