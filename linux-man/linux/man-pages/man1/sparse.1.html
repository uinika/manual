       Sparse parses C source and looks for errors, producing warnings on
       standard error.

       Sparse accepts options controlling the set of warnings to generate.
       To turn on warnings Sparse does not issue by default, use the
       corresponding warning option <b>-Wsomething</b>.  Sparse issues some
       warnings by default; to turn off those warnings, pass the negation of
       the associated warning option, <b>-Wno-something</b>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="WARNING_OPTIONS" href="#WARNING_OPTIONS"></a>WARNING OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-Wsparse-all</b>
              Turn on all sparse warnings, except for those explicitly
              disabled via <b>-Wno-something</b>.

       <b>-Wsparse-error</b>
              Turn all sparse warnings into errors.

       <b>-Waddress-space</b>
              Warn about code which mixes pointers to different address
              spaces.

              Sparse allows an extended attribute
              <b>__attribute__((address_space(</b><i>num</i><b>))) </b>on pointers, which
              designates a pointer target in address space <i>num</i> (a constant
              integer).  With <b>-Waddress-space</b>, Sparse treats pointers with
              identical target types but different address spaces as
              distinct types.  To override this warning, such as for
              functions which convert pointers between address spaces, use a
              type that includes <b>__attribute__((force))</b>.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-address-space</b>.

       <b>-Wbitwise</b>
              Warn about unsupported operations or type mismatches with
              restricted integer types.

              Sparse supports an extended attribute,
              <b>__attribute__((bitwise))</b>, which creates a new restricted
              integer type from a base integer type, distinct from the base
              integer type and from any other restricted integer type not
              declared in the same declaration or <b>typedef</b>.  For example,
              this allows programs to create <b>typedef</b>s for integer types with
              specific endianness.  With <b>-Wbitwise</b>, Sparse will warn on any
              use of a restricted type in arithmetic operations other than
              bitwise operations, and on any conversion of one restricted
              type into another, except via a cast that includes
              <b>__attribute__((force))</b>.

              __bitwise ends up being a "stronger integer separation". That
              one doesn't allow you to mix with non-bitwise integers, so now
              it's much harder to lose the type by mistake.

              __bitwise is for *unique types* that cannot be mixed with
              other types, and that you'd never want to just use as a random
              integer (the integer 0 is special, though, and gets silently
              accepted iirc - it's kind of like "NULL" for pointers). So
              "gfp_t" or the "safe endianness" types would be __bitwise: you
              can only operate on them by doing specific operations that
              know about *that* particular type.

              Generally, you want bitwise if you are looking for type
              safety. Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wcast-to-as</b>
              Warn about casts which add an address space to a pointer type.

              A cast that includes <b>__attribute__((force)) </b>will suppress this
              warning.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wcast-truncate</b>
              Warn about casts that truncate constant values.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-cast-truncate</b>.

       <b>-Wcontext</b>
              Warn about potential errors in synchronization or other
              delimited contexts.

              Sparse supports several means of designating functions or
              statements that delimit contexts, such as synchronization.
              Functions with the extended attribute
              <b>__attribute__((context(</b><i>expression</i><b>,</b><i>in_context</i><b>,</b><i>out_context</i><b>))</b>
              require the context <i>expression</i> (for instance, a lock) to have
              the value <i>in_context</i> (a constant nonnegative integer) when
              called, and return with the value <i>out_context</i> (a constant
              nonnegative integer).  For APIs defined via macros, use the
              statement form <b>__context__(</b><i>expression</i><b>,</b><i>in_value</i><b>,</b><i>out_value</i><b>) </b>in
              the body of the macro.

              With <b>-Wcontext </b>Sparse will warn when it sees a function change
              the context without indicating this with a <b>context </b>attribute,
              either by decreasing a context below zero (such as by
              releasing a lock without acquiring it), or returning with a
              changed context (such as by acquiring a lock without releasing
              it).  Sparse will also warn about blocks of code which may
              potentially execute with different contexts.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-context</b>.

       <b>-Wdecl </b>Warn about any non-<b>static </b>variable or function definition that
              has no previous declaration.

              Private symbols (functions and variables) internal to a given
              source file should use <b>static</b>, to allow additional compiler
              optimizations, allow detection of unused symbols, and prevent
              other code from relying on these internal symbols.  Public
              symbols used by other source files will need declarations
              visible to those other source files, such as in a header file.
              All declarations should fall into one of these two categories.
              Thus, with <b>-Wdecl</b>, Sparse warns about any symbol definition
              with neither <b>static </b>nor a declaration.  To fix this warning,
              declare private symbols <b>static</b>, and ensure that the files
              defining public symbols have the symbol declarations available
              first (such as by including the appropriate header file).

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-decl</b>.

       <b>-Wdeclaration-after-statement</b>
              Warn about declarations that are not at the start of a block.

              These declarations are permitted in C99 but not in C89.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default only when the C
              dialect is C89 (i.e. -ansi or -std=c89).  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-declaration-after-statement</b>.

       <b>-Wdefault-bitfield-sign</b>
              Warn about any bitfield with no explicit signedness.

              Bitfields have no standard-specified default signedness. (C99
              6.7.2) A bitfield without an explicit <b>signed </b>or <b>unsigned</b>
              creates a portability problem for software that relies on the
              available range of values.  To fix this, specify the bitfield
              type as <b>signed </b>or <b>unsigned </b>explicitly.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wdesignated-init</b>
              Warn about positional initialization of structs marked as
              requiring designated initializers.

              Sparse allows an attribute <b>__attribute__((designated_init))</b>
              which marks a struct as requiring designated initializers.
              Sparse will warn about positional initialization of a struct
              variable or struct literal of a type that has this attribute.

              Requiring designated initializers for a particular struct type
              will insulate code using that struct type from changes to the
              layout of the type, avoiding the need to change initializers
              for that type unless they initialize a removed or incompatibly
              changed field.

              Common examples of this type of struct include collections of
              function pointers for the implementations of a class of
              related operations, for which the default NULL for an
              unmentioned field in a designated initializer will correctly
              indicate the absence of that operation.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-designated-init</b>.

       <b>-Wdo-while</b>
              Warn about do-while loops that do not delimit the loop body
              with braces.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wenum-mismatch</b>
              Warn about the use of an expression of an incorrect <b>enum </b>type
              when initializing another <b>enum </b>type, assigning to another <b>enum</b>
              type, or passing an argument to a function which expects
              another <b>enum </b>type.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-enum-mismatch</b>.

       <b>-Winit-cstring</b>
              Warn about initialization of a char array with a too long
              constant C string.

              If the size of the char array and the length of the string is
              the same, there is no space for the last nul char of the
              string in the array:

              char s[3] = "abc";

              If the array is used as a byte array, not as C string, this
              warning is just noise. However, if the array is passed to
              functions dealing with C string like printf(%s) and strcmp, it
              may cause a trouble.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wmemcpy-max-count</b>
              Warn about call of <b>memcpy()</b>, <b>memset()</b>, <b>copy_from_user()</b>, or
              <b>copy_to_user() </b>with a large compile-time byte count.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default. To turn them off, use
              <b>-Wno-memcpy-max-count</b>.

              The limit can be changed with <b>-fmemcpy-max-count=COUNT</b>, the
              default being <b>100000</b>.

       <b>-Wnon-pointer-null</b>
              Warn about the use of 0 as a NULL pointer.

              0 has integer type.  NULL has pointer type.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-non-pointer-null</b>.

       <b>-Wold-initializer</b>
              Warn about the use of the pre-C99 GCC syntax for designated
              initializers.

              C99 provides a standard syntax for designated fields in <b>struct</b>
              or <b>union </b>initializers:

              struct structname var = { .field = value };

              GCC also has an old, non-standard syntax for designated
              initializers which predates C99:

              struct structname var = { field: value };

              Sparse will warn about the use of GCC's non-standard syntax
              for designated initializers.  To fix this warning, convert
              designated initializers to use the standard C99 syntax.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-old-initializer</b>.

       <b>-Wone-bit-signed-bitfield</b>
              Warn about any one-bit <b>signed </b>bitfields.

              A one-bit <b>signed </b>bitfield can only have the values 0 and -1,
              or with some compilers only 0; this results in unexpected
              behavior for programs which expected the ability to store 0
              and 1.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-one-bit-signed-bitfield</b>.

       <b>-Wparen-string</b>
              Warn about the use of a parenthesized string to initialize an
              array.

              Standard C syntax does not permit a parenthesized string as an
              array initializer.  GCC allows this syntax as an extension.
              With <b>-Wparen-string</b>, Sparse will warn about this syntax.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wptr-subtraction-blows</b>
              Warn when subtracting two pointers to a type with a non-power-
              of-two size.

              Subtracting two pointers to a given type gives a difference in
              terms of the number of items of that type.  To generate this
              value, compilers will usually need to divide the difference by
              the size of the type, an potentially expensive operation for
              sizes other than powers of two.

              Code written using pointer subtraction can often use another
              approach instead, such as array indexing with an explicit
              array index variable, which may allow compilers to generate
              more efficient code.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wreturn-void</b>
              Warn if a function with return type void returns a void
              expression.

              C99 permits this, and in some cases this allows for more
              generic code in macros that use typeof or take a type as a
              macro argument.  However, some programs consider this poor
              style, and those programs can use <b>-Wreturn-void </b>to get
              warnings about it.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wshadow</b>
              Warn when declaring a symbol which shadows a declaration with
              the same name in an outer scope.

              Such declarations can lead to error-prone code.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wsizeof-bool</b>
              Warn when checking the sizeof a _Bool.

              C99 does not specify the sizeof a _Bool.  gcc uses 1.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wtransparent-union</b>
              Warn about any declaration using the GCC extension
              <b>__attribute__((transparent_union))</b>.

              Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off,
              use <b>-Wno-transparent-union</b>.

       <b>-Wtypesign</b>
              Warn when converting a pointer to an integer type into a
              pointer to an integer type with different signedness.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
              Warn about preprocessor conditionals that use the value of an
              undefined preprocessor symbol.

              Standard C (C99 6.10.1) permits using the value of an
              undefined preprocessor symbol in preprocessor conditionals,
              and specifies it has have a value of 0.  However, this
              behavior can lead to subtle errors.

              Sparse does not issue these warnings by default.

       <b>-fmemcpy-max-count=COUNT</b>
              Set the limit for the warnings given by <b>-Wmemcpy-max-count</b>.  A
              COUNT of 0, useless in itself, will effectively disable the
              warning.  The default limit is 100000.

       <b>-ftabstop=WIDTH</b>
              Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps sparse report
              correct column numbers in warnings or errors.  If the value is
              less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored.  The
              default is 8.
