       <i>Gawk</i> is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
       language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the POSIX
       1003.1 Standard.  This version in turn is based on the description in
       <i>The AWK Programming Language</i>, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.
       <i>Gawk</i> provides the additional features found in the current version of
       Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i> and a number of GNU-specific extensions.

       The command line consists of options to <i>gawk</i> itself, the AWK program
       text (if not supplied via the <b>-f </b>or <b>--file </b>options), and values to be
       made available in the <b>ARGC </b>and <b>ARGV </b>pre-defined AWK variables.

       When <i>gawk</i> is invoked with the <b>--profile </b>option, it starts gathering
       profiling statistics from the execution of the program.  <i>Gawk</i> runs
       more slowly in this mode, and automatically produces an execution
       profile in the file <b>awkprof.out </b>when done.  See the <b>--profile </b>option,
       below.

       <i>Gawk</i> also has an integrated debugger. An interactive debugging
       session can be started by supplying the <b>--debug </b>option to the command
       line. In this mode of execution, <i>gawk</i> loads the AWK source code and
       then prompts for debugging commands.  <i>Gawk</i> can only debug AWK program
       source provided with the <b>-f </b>option.  The debugger is documented in
       <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTION_FORMAT" href="#OPTION_FORMAT"></a>OPTION FORMAT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> options may be either traditional POSIX-style one letter
       options, or GNU-style long options.  POSIX options start with a
       single “-”, while long options start with “--”.  Long options are
       provided for both GNU-specific features and for POSIX-mandated
       features.

       <i>Gawk</i>-specific options are typically used in long-option form.
       Arguments to long options are either joined with the option by an <b>=</b>
       sign, with no intervening spaces, or they may be provided in the next
       command line argument.  Long options may be abbreviated, as long as
       the abbreviation remains unique.

       Additionally, every long option has a corresponding short option, so
       that the option's functionality may be used from within <b>#!</b>
       executable scripts.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> accepts the following options.  Standard options are listed
       first, followed by options for <i>gawk</i> extensions, listed alphabetically
       by short option.

       <b>-f </b><i>program-file</i>
       <b>--file </b><i>program-file</i>
              Read the AWK program source from the file <i>program-file</i>,
              instead of from the first command line argument.  Multiple <b>-f</b>
              (or <b>--file</b>) options may be used.

       <b>-F </b><i>fs</i>
       <b>--field-separator </b><i>fs</i>
              Use <i>fs</i> for the input field separator (the value of the <b>FS</b>
              predefined variable).

       <b>-v </b><i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i>
       <b>--assign </b><i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i>
              Assign the value <i>val</i> to the variable <i>var</i>, before execution of
              the program begins.  Such variable values are available to the
              <b>BEGIN </b>rule of an AWK program.

       <b>-b</b>
       <b>--characters-as-bytes</b>
              Treat all input data as single-byte characters. In other
              words, don't pay any attention to the locale information when
              attempting to process strings as multibyte characters.  The
              <b>--posix </b>option overrides this one.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--traditional</b>
              Run in <i>compatibility</i> mode.  In compatibility mode, <i>gawk</i>
              behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i>; none of the GNU-
              specific extensions are recognized.  See <b>GNU EXTENSIONS</b>,
              below, for more information.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--copyright</b>
              Print the short version of the GNU copyright information
              message on the standard output and exit successfully.

       <b>-d</b>[<i>file</i>]
       <b>--dump-variables</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Print a sorted list of global variables, their types and final
              values to <i>file</i>.  If no <i>file</i> is provided, <i>gawk</i> uses a file
              named <b>awkvars.out </b>in the current directory.
              Having a list of all the global variables is a good way to
              look for typographical errors in your programs.  You would
              also use this option if you have a large program with a lot of
              functions, and you want to be sure that your functions don't
              inadvertently use global variables that you meant to be local.
              (This is a particularly easy mistake to make with simple
              variable names like <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, and so on.)

       <b>-D</b>[<i>file</i>]
       <b>--debug</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enable debugging of AWK programs.  By default, the debugger
              reads commands interactively from the keyboard (standard
              input).  The optional <i>file</i> argument specifies a file with a
              list of commands for the debugger to execute non-
              interactively.

       <b>-e </b><i>program-text</i>
       <b>--source </b><i>program-text</i>
              Use <i>program-text</i> as AWK program source code.  This option
              allows the easy intermixing of library functions (used via the
              <b>-f </b>and <b>--file </b>options) with source code entered on the command
              line.  It is intended primarily for medium to large AWK
              programs used in shell scripts.

       <b>-E </b><i>file</i>
       <b>--exec </b><i>file</i>
              Similar to <b>-f</b>, however, this is option is the last one
              processed.  This should be used with <b>#!  </b>scripts, particularly
              for CGI applications, to avoid passing in options or source
              code (!) on the command line from a URL.  This option disables
              command-line variable assignments.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--gen-pot</b>
              Scan and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU <b>.pot</b>
              (Portable Object Template) format file on standard output with
              entries for all localizable strings in the program.  The
              program itself is not executed.  See the GNU <i>gettext</i>
              distribution for more information on <b>.pot </b>files.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help </b>Print a relatively short summary of the available options on
              the standard output.  (Per the <i>GNU Coding Standards</i>, these
              options cause an immediate, successful exit.)

       <b>-i </b><i>include-file</i>
       <b>--include </b><i>include-file</i>
              Load an awk source library.  This searches for the library
              using the <b>AWKPATH </b>environment variable.  If the initial search
              fails, another attempt will be made after appending the <b>.awk</b>
              suffix.  The file will be loaded only once (i.e., duplicates
              are eliminated), and the code does not constitute the main
              program source.

       <b>-l </b><i>lib</i>
       <b>--load </b><i>lib</i>
              Load a shared library <i>lib</i>.  This searches for the library
              using the <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>environment variable.  If the initial
              search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the
              default shared library suffix for the platform.  The library
              initialization routine is expected to be named <b>dl_load()</b>.

       <b>-L </b>[<i>value</i>]
       <b>--lint</b>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>]
              Provide warnings about constructs that are dubious or non-
              portable to other AWK implementations.  With an optional
              argument of <b>fatal</b>, lint warnings become fatal errors.  This
              may be drastic, but its use will certainly encourage the
              development of cleaner AWK programs.  With an optional
              argument of <b>invalid</b>, only warnings about things that are
              actually invalid are issued. (This is not fully implemented
              yet.)

       <b>-M</b>
       <b>--bignum</b>
              Force arbitrary precision arithmetic on numbers. This option
              has no effect if <i>gawk</i> is not compiled to use the GNU MPFR and
              MP libraries.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--non-decimal-data</b>
              Recognize octal and hexadecimal values in input data.  <i>Use</i>
              <i>this option with great caution!</i>

       <b>-N</b>
       <b>--use-lc-numeric</b>
              This forces <i>gawk</i> to use the locale's decimal point character
              when parsing input data.  Although the POSIX standard requires
              this behavior, and <i>gawk</i> does so when <b>--posix </b>is in effect, the
              default is to follow traditional behavior and use a period as
              the decimal point, even in locales where the period is not the
              decimal point character.  This option overrides the default
              behavior, without the full draconian strictness of the <b>--posix</b>
              option.

       <b>-o</b>[<i>file</i>]
       <b>--pretty-print</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Output a pretty printed version of the program to <i>file</i>.  If no
              <i>file</i> is provided, <i>gawk</i> uses a file named <b>awkprof.out </b>in the
              current directory.  Implies <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-O</b>
       <b>--optimize</b>
              Enable <i>gawk</i>'s default optimizations upon the internal
              representation of the program.  Currently, this includes
              simple constant-folding, and tail call elimination for
              recursive functions.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-p</b>[<i>prof-file</i>]
       <b>--profile</b>[<b>=</b><i>prof-file</i>]
              Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to
              <i>prof-file</i>.  The default is <b>awkprof.out</b>.  The profile contains
              execution counts of each statement in the program in the left
              margin and function call counts for each user-defined
              function.  Implies <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-P</b>
       <b>--posix</b>
              This turns on <i>compatibility</i> mode, with the following
              additional restrictions:

              · <b>\x </b>escape sequences are not recognized.

              · You cannot continue lines after <b>?  </b>and <b>:</b>.

              · The synonym <b>func </b>for the keyword <b>function </b>is not recognized.

              · The operators <b>** </b>and <b>**= </b>cannot be used in place of <b>^ </b>and
                <b>^=</b>.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--re-interval</b>
              Enable the use of <i>interval expressions</i> in regular expression
              matching (see <b>Regular Expressions</b>, below).  Interval
              expressions were not traditionally available in the AWK
              language.  The POSIX standard added them, to make <i>awk</i> and
              <i>egrep</i> consistent with each other.  They are enabled by
              default, but this option remains for use with <b>--traditional</b>.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--no-optimize</b>
              Disable <i>gawk</i>'s default optimizations upon the internal
              representation of the program.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--sandbox</b>
              Runs <i>gawk</i> in sandbox mode, disabling the <b>system() </b>function,
              input redirection with <b>getline</b>, output redirection with <b>print</b>
              and <b>printf</b>, and loading dynamic extensions.  Command execution
              (through pipelines) is also disabled.  This effectively blocks
              a script from accessing local resources (except for the files
              specified on the command line).

       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--lint-old</b>
              Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to the
              original version of UNIX <i>awk</i>.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Print version information for this particular copy of <i>gawk</i> on
              the standard output.  This is useful mainly for knowing if the
              current copy of <i>gawk</i> on your system is up to date with respect
              to whatever the Free Software Foundation is distributing.
              This is also useful when reporting bugs.  (Per the <i>GNU Coding</i>
              <i>Standards</i>, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.)

       <b>--     </b>Signal the end of options. This is useful to allow further
              arguments to the AWK program itself to start with a “-”.  This
              provides consistency with the argument parsing convention used
              by most other POSIX programs.

       In compatibility mode, any other options are flagged as invalid, but
       are otherwise ignored.  In normal operation, as long as program text
       has been supplied, unknown options are passed on to the AWK program
       in the <b>ARGV </b>array for processing.  This is particularly useful for
       running AWK programs via the “#!” executable interpreter mechanism.

       For POSIX compatibility, the <b>-W </b>option may be used, followed by the
       name of a long option.

<h2><a id="AWK_PROGRAM_EXECUTION" href="#AWK_PROGRAM_EXECUTION"></a>AWK PROGRAM EXECUTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       An AWK program consists of a sequence of pattern-action statements
       and optional function definitions.

              <b>@include "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
              <b>@load "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
              <i>pattern</i>   <b>{ </b><i>action statements</i> <b>}</b>
              <b>function </b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameter list</i><b>) { </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>

       <i>Gawk</i> first reads the program source from the <i>program-file</i>(s) if
       specified, from arguments to <b>--source</b>, or from the first non-option
       argument on the command line.  The <b>-f </b>and <b>--source </b>options may be
       used multiple times on the command line.  <i>Gawk</i> reads the program text
       as if all the <i>program-file</i>s and command line source texts had been
       concatenated together.  This is useful for building libraries of AWK
       functions, without having to include them in each new AWK program
       that uses them.  It also provides the ability to mix library
       functions with command line programs.

       In addition, lines beginning with <b>@include </b>may be used to include
       other source files into your program, making library use even easier.
       This is equivalent to using the <b>-i </b>option.

       Lines beginning with <b>@load </b>may be used to load shared libraries into
       your program.  This is equivalent to using the <b>-l </b>option.

       The environment variable <b>AWKPATH </b>specifies a search path to use when
       finding source files named with the <b>-f </b>and <b>-i </b>options.  If this
       variable does not exist, the default path is
       <b>".:/usr/local/share/awk"</b>.  (The actual directory may vary, depending
       upon how <i>gawk</i> was built and installed.)  If a file name given to the
       <b>-f </b>option contains a “/” character, no path search is performed.

       The environment variable <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>specifies a search path to use
       when finding source files named with the <b>-l </b>option.  If this variable
       does not exist, the default path is <b>"/usr/local/lib/gawk"</b>.  (The
       actual directory may vary, depending upon how <i>gawk</i> was built and
       installed.)

       <i>Gawk</i> executes AWK programs in the following order.  First, all
       variable assignments specified via the <b>-v </b>option are performed.
       Next, <i>gawk</i> compiles the program into an internal form.  Then, <i>gawk</i>
       executes the code in the <b>BEGIN </b>rule(s) (if any), and then proceeds to
       read each file named in the <b>ARGV </b>array (up to <b>ARGV[ARGC]</b>).  If there
       are no files named on the command line, <i>gawk</i> reads the standard
       input.

       If a filename on the command line has the form <i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i> it is treated
       as a variable assignment.  The variable <i>var</i> will be assigned the
       value <i>val</i>.  (This happens after any <b>BEGIN </b>rule(s) have been run.)
       Command line variable assignment is most useful for dynamically
       assigning values to the variables AWK uses to control how input is
       broken into fields and records.  It is also useful for controlling
       state if multiple passes are needed over a single data file.

       If the value of a particular element of <b>ARGV </b>is empty (<b>""</b>), <i>gawk</i>
       skips over it.

       For each input file, if a <b>BEGINFILE </b>rule exists, <i>gawk</i> executes the
       associated code before processing the contents of the file.
       Similarly, <i>gawk</i> executes the code associated with <b>ENDFILE </b>after
       processing the file.

       For each record in the input, <i>gawk</i> tests to see if it matches any
       <i>pattern</i> in the AWK program.  For each pattern that the record
       matches, <i>gawk</i> executes the associated <i>action</i>.  The patterns are
       tested in the order they occur in the program.

       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, <i>gawk</i> executes the code in
       the <b>END </b>rule(s) (if any).

   <b>Command Line Directories</b>
       According to POSIX, files named on the <i>awk</i> command line must be text
       files.  The behavior is ``undefined'' if they are not.  Most versions
       of <i>awk</i> treat a directory on the command line as a fatal error.

       Starting with version 4.0 of <i>gawk</i>, a directory on the command line
       produces a warning, but is otherwise skipped.  If either of the
       <b>--posix </b>or <b>--traditional </b>options is given, then <i>gawk</i> reverts to
       treating directories on the command line as a fatal error.

<h2><a id="VARIABLES,_RECORDS_AND_FIELDS" href="#VARIABLES,_RECORDS_AND_FIELDS"></a>VARIABLES, RECORDS AND FIELDS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are
       first used.  Their values are either floating-point numbers or
       strings, or both, depending upon how they are used.  AWK also has one
       dimensional arrays; arrays with multiple dimensions may be simulated.
       <i>Gawk</i> provides true arrays of arrays; see <b>Arrays</b>, below.  Several pre-
       defined variables are set as a program runs; these are described as
       needed and summarized below.

   <b>Records</b>
       Normally, records are separated by newline characters.  You can
       control how records are separated by assigning values to the built-in
       variable <b>RS</b>.  If <b>RS </b>is any single character, that character separates
       records.  Otherwise, <b>RS </b>is a regular expression.  Text in the input
       that matches this regular expression separates the record.  However,
       in compatibility mode, only the first character of its string value
       is used for separating records.  If <b>RS </b>is set to the null string,
       then records are separated by blank lines.  When <b>RS </b>is set to the
       null string, the newline character always acts as a field separator,
       in addition to whatever value <b>FS </b>may have.

   <b>Fields</b>
       As each input record is read, <i>gawk</i> splits the record into <i>fields</i>,
       using the value of the <b>FS </b>variable as the field separator.  If <b>FS </b>is
       a single character, fields are separated by that character.  If <b>FS </b>is
       the null string, then each individual character becomes a separate
       field.  Otherwise, <b>FS </b>is expected to be a full regular expression.
       In the special case that <b>FS </b>is a single space, fields are separated
       by runs of spaces and/or tabs and/or newlines.  <b>NOTE</b>: The value of
       <b>IGNORECASE </b>(see below) also affects how fields are split when <b>FS </b>is a
       regular expression, and how records are separated when <b>RS </b>is a
       regular expression.

       If the <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>variable is set to a space-separated list of
       numbers, each field is expected to have fixed width, and <i>gawk</i> splits
       up the record using the specified widths.  Each field width may
       optionally be preceded by a colon-separated value specifying the
       number of characters to skip before the field starts.  The value of
       <b>FS </b>is ignored.  Assigning a new value to <b>FS </b>or <b>FPAT </b>overrides the use
       of <b>FIELDWIDTHS</b>.

       Similarly, if the <b>FPAT </b>variable is set to a string representing a
       regular expression, each field is made up of text that matches that
       regular expression. In this case, the regular expression describes
       the fields themselves, instead of the text that separates the fields.
       Assigning a new value to <b>FS </b>or <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>overrides the use of <b>FPAT</b>.

       Each field in the input record may be referenced by its position: <b>$1</b>,
       <b>$2</b>, and so on.  <b>$0 </b>is the whole record.  Fields need not be
       referenced by constants:

              <b>n = 5</b>
              <b>print $n</b>

       prints the fifth field in the input record.

       The variable <b>NF </b>is set to the total number of fields in the input
       record.

       References to non-existent fields (i.e., fields after <b>$NF</b>) produce
       the null-string.  However, assigning to a non-existent field (e.g.,
       <b>$(NF+2) = 5</b>) increases the value of <b>NF</b>, creates any intervening
       fields with the null string as their values, and causes the value of
       <b>$0 </b>to be recomputed, with the fields being separated by the value of
       <b>OFS</b>.  References to negative numbered fields cause a fatal error.
       Decrementing <b>NF </b>causes the values of fields past the new value to be
       lost, and the value of <b>$0 </b>to be recomputed, with the fields being
       separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.

       Assigning a value to an existing field causes the whole record to be
       rebuilt when <b>$0 </b>is referenced.  Similarly, assigning a value to <b>$0</b>
       causes the record to be resplit, creating new values for the fields.

   <b>Built-in Variables</b>
       <i>Gawk</i>'s built-in variables are:

       <b>ARGC        </b>The number of command line arguments (does not include
                   options to <i>gawk</i>, or the program source).

       <b>ARGIND      </b>The index in <b>ARGV </b>of the current file being processed.

       <b>ARGV        </b>Array of command line arguments.  The array is indexed
                   from 0 to <b>ARGC </b>- 1.  Dynamically changing the contents of
                   <b>ARGV </b>can control the files used for data.

       <b>BINMODE     </b>On non-POSIX systems, specifies use of “binary” mode for
                   all file I/O.  Numeric values of 1, 2, or 3, specify that
                   input files, output files, or all files, respectively,
                   should use binary I/O.  String values of <b>"r"</b>, or <b>"w"</b>
                   specify that input files, or output files, respectively,
                   should use binary I/O.  String values of <b>"rw" </b>or <b>"wr"</b>
                   specify that all files should use binary I/O.  Any other
                   string value is treated as <b>"rw"</b>, but generates a warning
                   message.

       <b>CONVFMT     </b>The conversion format for numbers, <b>"%.6g"</b>, by default.

       <b>ENVIRON     </b>An array containing the values of the current
                   environment.  The array is indexed by the environment
                   variables, each element being the value of that variable
                   (e.g., <b>ENVIRON["HOME"] </b>might be <b>"/home/arnold"</b>).

                   In POSIX mode, changing this array does not affect the
                   environment seen by programs which <i>gawk</i> spawns via
                   redirection or the <b>system() </b>function.  Otherwise, <i>gawk</i>
                   updates its real environment so that programs it spawns
                   see the changes.

       <b>ERRNO       </b>If a system error occurs either doing a redirection for
                   <b>getline</b>, during a read for <b>getline</b>, or during a <b>close()</b>,
                   then <b>ERRNO </b>will contain a string describing the error.
                   The value is subject to translation in non-English
                   locales.  If the string in <b>ERRNO </b>corresponds to a system
                   error in the <a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> variable, then the numeric value
                   can be found in <b>PROCINFO["errno"].  </b>For non-system
                   errors, <b>PROCINFO["errno"] </b>will be zero.

       <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>A whitespace-separated list of field widths.  When set,
                   <i>gawk</i> parses the input into fields of fixed width, instead
                   of using the value of the <b>FS </b>variable as the field
                   separator.  Each field width may optionally be preceded
                   by a colon-separated value specifying the number of
                   characters to skip before the field starts.  See <b>Fields</b>,
                   above.

       <b>FILENAME    </b>The name of the current input file.  If no files are
                   specified on the command line, the value of <b>FILENAME </b>is
                   “-”.  However, <b>FILENAME </b>is undefined inside the <b>BEGIN</b>
                   rule (unless set by <b>getline</b>).

       <b>FNR         </b>The input record number in the current input file.

       <b>FPAT        </b>A regular expression describing the contents of the
                   fields in a record.  When set, <i>gawk</i> parses the input into
                   fields, where the fields match the regular expression,
                   instead of using the value of the <b>FS </b>variable as the
                   field separator.  See <b>Fields</b>, above.

       <b>FS          </b>The input field separator, a space by default.  See
                   <b>Fields</b>, above.

       <b>FUNCTAB     </b>An array whose indices and corresponding values are the
                   names of all the user-defined or extension functions in
                   the program.  <b>NOTE</b>: You may not use the <b>delete </b>statement
                   with the <b>FUNCTAB </b>array.

       <b>IGNORECASE  </b>Controls the case-sensitivity of all regular expression
                   and string operations.  If <b>IGNORECASE </b>has a non-zero
                   value, then string comparisons and pattern matching in
                   rules, field splitting with <b>FS </b>and <b>FPAT</b>, record
                   separating with <b>RS</b>, regular expression matching with <b>~</b>
                   and <b>!~</b>, and the <b>gensub()</b>, <b>gsub()</b>, <b>index()</b>, <b>match()</b>,
                   <b>patsplit()</b>, <b>split()</b>, and <b>sub() </b>built-in functions all
                   ignore case when doing regular expression operations.
                   <b>NOTE</b>: Array subscripting is <i>not</i> affected.  However, the
                   <b>asort() </b>and <b>asorti() </b>functions are affected.
                   Thus, if <b>IGNORECASE </b>is not equal to zero, <b>/aB/ </b>matches
                   all of the strings <b>"ab"</b>, <b>"aB"</b>, <b>"Ab"</b>, and <b>"AB"</b>.  As with
                   all AWK variables, the initial value of <b>IGNORECASE </b>is
                   zero, so all regular expression and string operations are
                   normally case-sensitive.

       <b>LINT        </b>Provides dynamic control of the <b>--lint </b>option from within
                   an AWK program.  When true, <i>gawk</i> prints lint warnings.
                   When false, it does not.  When assigned the string value
                   <b>"fatal"</b>, lint warnings become fatal errors, exactly like
                   <b>--lint=fatal</b>.  Any other true value just prints warnings.

       <b>NF          </b>The number of fields in the current input record.

       <b>NR          </b>The total number of input records seen so far.

       <b>OFMT        </b>The output format for numbers, <b>"%.6g"</b>, by default.

       <b>OFS         </b>The output field separator, a space by default.

       <b>ORS         </b>The output record separator, by default a newline.

       <b>PREC        </b>The working precision of arbitrary precision floating-
                   point numbers, 53 by default.

       <b>PROCINFO    </b>The elements of this array provide access to information
                   about the running AWK program.  On some systems, there
                   may be elements in the array, <b>"group1" </b>through <b>"group</b><i>n</i><b>"</b>
                   for some <i>n</i>, which is the number of supplementary groups
                   that the process has.  Use the <b>in </b>operator to test for
                   these elements.  The following elements are guaranteed to
                   be available:

                   <b>PROCINFO["egid"]     </b>The value of the <a href="../man2/getegid.2.html">getegid(2)</a> system
                                        call.

                   <b>PROCINFO["errno"]    </b>The value of <a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> when <b>ERRNO </b>is
                                        set to the associated error message.

                   <b>PROCINFO["euid"]     </b>The value of the <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> system
                                        call.

                   <b>PROCINFO["FS"]       "FS" </b>if field splitting with <b>FS </b>is
                                        in effect, <b>"FPAT" </b>if field splitting
                                        with <b>FPAT </b>is in effect,
                                        <b>"FIELDWIDTHS" </b>if field splitting
                                        with <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>is in effect, or
                                        <b>"API" </b>if API input parser field
                                        splitting is in effect.

                   <b>PROCINFO["gid"]      </b>The value of the <a href="../man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a> system
                                        call.

                   <b>PROCINFO["identifiers"]</b>
                                        A subarray, indexed by the names of
                                        all identifiers used in the text of
                                        the AWK program.  The values
                                        indicate what <i>gawk</i> knows about the
                                        identifiers after it has finished
                                        parsing the program; they are <i>not</i>
                                        updated while the program runs.  For
                                        each identifier, the value of the
                                        element is one of the following:

                                        <b>"array"     </b>The identifier is an
                                                    array.

                                        <b>"untyped"   </b>The identifier is
                                                    untyped (could be used
                                                    as a scalar or array,

                   <b>PROCINFO["prec_max"]</b>
                          The maximum precision supported by the GNU MPFR
                          library for arbitrary precision floating-point
                          numbers.

                          library for arbitrary precision floating-point
                          numbers.

                   The following elements may set by a program to change
                   <i>gawk</i>'s behavior:

                   <b>PROCINFO["NONFATAL"]</b>
                          If this exists, then I/O errors for all output
                          redirections become nonfatal.

                   <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>output_name</i><b>", "NONFATAL"]</b>
                          Make output errors for <i>output_name</i> be nonfatal.

                   <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>command</i><b>", "pty"]</b>
                          Use a pseudo-tty for two-way communication with
                          <i>command</i> instead of setting up two one-way pipes.

                   <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>input</i><b>", "READ_TIMEOUT"]</b>
                          The timeout in milliseconds for reading data from
                          <i>input</i>, where <i>input</i> is a redirection string or a
                          filename. A value of zero or less than zero means
                          no timeout.

                   <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>input</i><b>", "RETRY"]</b>
                          If an I/O error that may be retried occurs when
                          reading data from <i>input</i>, and this array entry
                          exists, then <b>getline </b>will return -2 instead of
                          following the default behavior of returning -1 and
                          configuring <i>input</i> to return no further data.  An
                          I/O error that may be retried is one where
                          <a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> has the value EAGAIN, EWOULDBLOCK, EINTR,
                          or ETIMEDOUT.  This may be useful in conjunction
                          with <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>input</i><b>", "READ_TIMEOUT"] </b>or
                          situations where a file descriptor has been
                          configured to behave in a non-blocking fashion.

                   <b>PROCINFO["sorted_in"]</b>
                          If this element exists in <b>PROCINFO</b>, then its value
                          controls the order in which array elements are
                          traversed in <b>for </b>loops.  Supported values are
                          <b>"@ind_str_asc"</b>, <b>"@ind_num_asc"</b>, <b>"@val_type_asc"</b>,
                          <b>"@val_str_asc"</b>, <b>"@val_num_asc"</b>, <b>"@ind_str_desc"</b>,
                          <b>"@ind_num_desc"</b>, <b>"@val_type_desc"</b>,
                          <b>"@val_str_desc"</b>, <b>"@val_num_desc"</b>, and <b>"@unsorted"</b>.
                          The value can also be the name (as a <i>string</i>) of
                          any comparison function defined as follows:

                               <b>function cmp_func(i1, v1, i2, v2)</b>

                          where <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i> are the indices, and <i>v1</i> and <i>v2</i> are
                          the corresponding values of the two elements being
                          compared.  It should return a number less than,
                          equal to, or greater than 0, depending on how the
                          elements of the array are to be ordered.

       <b>ROUNDMODE   </b>The rounding mode to use for arbitrary precision
                   arithmetic on numbers, by default <b>"N" </b>(IEEE-754
                   roundTiesToEven mode).  The accepted values are <b>"N" </b>or
                   <b>"n" </b>for roundTiesToEven, <b>"U" </b>or <b>"u" </b>for
                   roundTowardPositive, <b>"D" </b>or <b>"d" </b>for roundTowardNegative,
                   <b>"Z" </b>or <b>"z" </b>for roundTowardZero, and if your version of
                   GNU MPFR library supports it, <b>"A" </b>or <b>"a" </b>for
                   roundTiesToAway.

       <b>RS          </b>The input record separator, by default a newline.

       <b>RT          </b>The record terminator.  <i>Gawk</i> sets <b>RT </b>to the input text
                   that matched the character or regular expression
                   specified by <b>RS</b>.

       <b>RSTART      </b>The index of the first character matched by <b>match()</b>; 0 if
                   no match.  (This implies that character indices start at
                   one.)

       <b>RLENGTH     </b>The length of the string matched by <b>match()</b>; -1 if no
                   match.

       <b>SUBSEP      </b>The character used to separate multiple subscripts in
                   array elements, by default <b>"\034"</b>.

       <b>SYMTAB      </b>An array whose indices are the names of all currently
                   defined global variables and arrays in the program.  The
                   array may be used for indirect access to read or write
                   the value of a variable:

                        <b>foo = 5</b>
                        <b>SYMTAB["foo"] = 4</b>
                        <b>print foo    # prints 4</b>

                   The <b>isarray() </b>function may be used to test if an element
                   in <b>SYMTAB </b>is an array.  You may not use the <b>delete</b>
                   statement with the <b>SYMTAB </b>array.

       <b>TEXTDOMAIN  </b>The text domain of the AWK program; used to find the
                   localized translations for the program's strings.

   <b>Arrays</b>
       Arrays are subscripted with an expression between square brackets (<b>[</b>
       and <b>]</b>).  If the expression is an expression list (<i>expr</i>, <i>expr</i> ...)
       then the array subscript is a string consisting of the concatenation
       of the (string) value of each expression, separated by the value of
       the <b>SUBSEP </b>variable.  This facility is used to simulate multiply
       dimensioned arrays.  For example:

              <b>i = "A"; j = "B"; k = "C"</b>
              <b>x[i, j, k] = "hello, world\n"</b>

       assigns the string <b>"hello, world\n" </b>to the element of the array <b>x</b>
       which is indexed by the string <b>"A\034B\034C"</b>.  All arrays in AWK are
       associative, i.e., indexed by string values.

       The special operator <b>in </b>may be used to test if an array has an index
       consisting of a particular value:

              <b>if (val in array)</b>
                   <b>print array[val]</b>

       If the array has multiple subscripts, use <b>(i, j) in array</b>.

       The <b>in </b>construct may also be used in a <b>for </b>loop to iterate over all
       the elements of an array.  However, the <b>(i, j) in array </b>construct
       only works in tests, not in <b>for </b>loops.

       An element may be deleted from an array using the <b>delete </b>statement.
       The <b>delete </b>statement may also be used to delete the entire contents
       of an array, just by specifying the array name without a subscript.

       <i>gawk</i> supports true multidimensional arrays. It does not require that
       such arrays be ``rectangular'' as in C or C++.  For example:

              <b>a[1] = 5</b>
              <b>a[2][1] = 6</b>
              <b>a[2][2] = 7</b>

       <b>NOTE</b>: You may need to tell <i>gawk</i> that an array element is really a
       subarray in order to use it where <i>gawk</i> expects an array (such as in
       the second argument to <b>split()</b>).  You can do this by creating an
       element in the subarray and then deleting it with the <b>delete</b>
       statement.

   <b>Variable Typing And Conversion</b>
       Variables and fields may be (floating point) numbers, or strings, or
       both.  How the value of a variable is interpreted depends upon its
       context.  If used in a numeric expression, it will be treated as a
       number; if used as a string it will be treated as a string.

       To force a variable to be treated as a number, add 0 to it; to force
       it to be treated as a string, concatenate it with the null string.

       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value 0 and the string value
       "" (the null, or empty, string).

       When a string must be converted to a number, the conversion is
       accomplished using <a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod(3)</a>.  A number is converted to a string by
       using the value of <b>CONVFMT </b>as a format string for <a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf(3)</a>, with
       the numeric value of the variable as the argument.  However, even
       though all numbers in AWK are floating-point, integral values are
       <i>always</i> converted as integers.  Thus, given

              <b>CONVFMT = "%2.2f"</b>
              <b>a = 12</b>
              <b>b = a ""</b>

       the variable <b>b </b>has a string value of <b>"12" </b>and not <b>"12.00"</b>.

       <b>NOTE</b>: When operating in POSIX mode (such as with the <b>--posix </b>option),
       beware that locale settings may interfere with the way decimal
       numbers are treated: the decimal separator of the numbers you are
       feeding to <i>gawk</i> must conform to what your locale would expect, be it
       a comma (,) or a period (.).

       <i>Gawk</i> performs comparisons as follows: If two variables are numeric,
       they are compared numerically.  If one value is numeric and the other
       has a string value that is a “numeric string,” then comparisons are
       also done numerically.  Otherwise, the numeric value is converted to
       a string and a string comparison is performed.  Two strings are
       compared, of course, as strings.

       Note that string constants, such as <b>"57"</b>, are <i>not</i> numeric strings,
       they are string constants.  The idea of “numeric string” only applies
       to fields, <b>getline </b>input, <b>FILENAME</b>, <b>ARGV </b>elements, <b>ENVIRON </b>elements
       and the elements of an array created by <b>split() </b>or <b>patsplit() </b>that
       are numeric strings.  The basic idea is that <i>user input</i>, and only
       user input, that looks numeric, should be treated that way.

   <b>Octal and Hexadecimal Constants</b>
       You may use C-style octal and hexadecimal constants in your AWK
       program source code.  For example, the octal value <b>011 </b>is equal to
       decimal <b>9</b>, and the hexadecimal value <b>0x11 </b>is equal to decimal 17.

   <b>String Constants</b>
       String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed between
       double quotes (like <b>"value"</b>).  Within strings, certain <i>escape</i>
       <i>sequences</i> are recognized, as in C.  These are:

       <b>\\   </b>A literal backslash.

       <b>\a   </b>The “alert” character; usually the ASCII BEL character.

       <b>\b   </b>Backspace.

       <b>\f   </b>Form-feed.

       <b>\n   </b>Newline.

       <b>\r   </b>Carriage return.

       <b>\t   </b>Horizontal tab.

       <b>\v   </b>Vertical tab.

       <b>\x</b><i>hex digits</i>
            The character represented by the string of hexadecimal digits
            following the <b>\x</b>.  Up to two following hexadecimal digits are
            considered part of the escape sequence.  E.g., <b>"\x1B" </b>is the
            ASCII ESC (escape) character.

       <b>\</b><i>ddd</i> The character represented by the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit sequence of
            octal digits.  E.g., <b>"\033" </b>is the ASCII ESC (escape) character.

       <b>\</b><i>c</i>   The literal character <i>c</i>.

       The escape sequences may also be used inside constant regular
       expressions (e.g., <b>/[ \t\f\n\r\v]/ </b>matches whitespace characters).

       In compatibility mode, the characters represented by octal and
       hexadecimal escape sequences are treated literally when used in
       regular expression constants.  Thus, <b>/a\52b/ </b>is equivalent to <b>/a\*b/</b>.

<h2><a id="PATTERNS_AND_ACTIONS" href="#PATTERNS_AND_ACTIONS"></a>PATTERNS AND ACTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       AWK is a line-oriented language.  The pattern comes first, and then
       the action.  Action statements are enclosed in <b>{ </b>and <b>}</b>.  Either the
       pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing, but, of course,
       not both.  If the pattern is missing, the action is executed for
       every single record of input.  A missing action is equivalent to

              <b>{ print }</b>

       which prints the entire record.

       Comments begin with the <b># </b>character, and continue until the end of
       the line.  Blank lines may be used to separate statements.  Normally,
       a statement ends with a newline, however, this is not the case for
       lines ending in a comma, <b>{</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>.  Lines ending in <b>do </b>or
       <b>else </b>also have their statements automatically continued on the
       following line.  In other cases, a line can be continued by ending it
       with a “\”, in which case the newline is ignored.

       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them with a
       “;”.  This applies to both the statements within the action part of a
       pattern-action pair (the usual case), and to the pattern-action
       statements themselves.

   <b>Patterns</b>
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:

              <b>BEGIN</b>
              <b>END</b>
              <b>BEGINFILE</b>
              <b>ENDFILE</b>
              <b>/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/</b>
              <i>relational expression</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>&amp;&amp; </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>|| </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>? </b><i>pattern</i> <b>: </b><i>pattern</i>
              <b>(</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b>
              <b>! </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern1</i><b>, </b><i>pattern2</i>

       <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END </b>are two special kinds of patterns which are not tested
       against the input.  The action parts of all <b>BEGIN </b>patterns are merged
       as if all the statements had been written in a single <b>BEGIN </b>rule.
       They are executed before any of the input is read.  Similarly, all
       the <b>END </b>rules are merged, and executed when all the input is
       exhausted (or when an <b>exit </b>statement is executed).  <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END</b>
       patterns cannot be combined with other patterns in pattern
       expressions.  <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END </b>patterns cannot have missing action
       parts.

       <b>BEGINFILE </b>and <b>ENDFILE </b>are additional special patterns whose bodies
       are executed before reading the first record of each command line
       input file and after reading the last record of each file.  Inside
       the <b>BEGINFILE </b>rule, the value of <b>ERRNO </b>will be the empty string if
       the file was opened successfully.  Otherwise, there is some problem
       with the file and the code should use <b>nextfile </b>to skip it. If that is
       not done, <i>gawk</i> produces its usual fatal error for files that cannot
       be opened.

       For <b>/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/ </b>patterns, the associated statement is
       executed for each input record that matches the regular expression.
       Regular expressions are the same as those in <a href="egrep.1.html">egrep(1)</a>, and are
       summarized below.

       A <i>relational expression</i> may use any of the operators defined below in
       the section on actions.  These generally test whether certain fields
       match certain regular expressions.

       The <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>||</b>, and <b>!  </b>operators are logical AND, logical OR, and logical
       NOT, respectively, as in C.  They do short-circuit evaluation, also
       as in C, and are used for combining more primitive pattern
       expressions.  As in most languages, parentheses may be used to change
       the order of evaluation.

       The <b>?: </b>operator is like the same operator in C.  If the first pattern
       is true then the pattern used for testing is the second pattern,
       otherwise it is the third.  Only one of the second and third patterns
       is evaluated.

       The <i>pattern1</i><b>, </b><i>pattern2</i> form of an expression is called a <i>range</i>
       <i>pattern</i>.  It matches all input records starting with a record that
       matches <i>pattern1</i>, and continuing until a record that matches
       <i>pattern2</i>, inclusive.  It does not combine with any other sort of
       pattern expression.

   <b>Regular Expressions</b>
       Regular expressions are the extended kind found in <i>egrep</i>.  They are
       composed of characters as follows:

       <i>c</i>          Matches the non-metacharacter <i>c</i>.

       <i>\c</i>         Matches the literal character <i>c</i>.

       <b>.          </b>Matches any character <i>including</i> newline.

       <b>^          </b>Matches the beginning of a string.

       <b>$          </b>Matches the end of a string.

       <b>[</b><i>abc...</i><b>]   </b>A character list: matches any of the characters <i>abc...</i>.
                  You may include a range of characters by separating them
                  with a dash.

       <b>[^</b><i>abc...</i><b>]  </b>A negated character list: matches any character except
                  <i>abc...</i>.

       <i>r1</i><b>|</b><i>r2</i>      Alternation: matches either <i>r1</i> or <i>r2</i>.

       <i>r1r2</i>       Concatenation: matches <i>r1</i>, and then <i>r2</i>.

       <i>r</i><b>+         </b>Matches one or more <i>r</i>'s.

       <i>r</i><b>*         </b>Matches zero or more <i>r</i>'s.

       <i>r</i><b>?         </b>Matches zero or one <i>r</i>'s.

       <b>(</b><i>r</i><b>)        </b>Grouping: matches <i>r</i>.

       <i>r</i><b>{</b><i>n</i><b>}</b>
       <i>r</i><b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,}</b>
       <i>r</i><b>{</b><i>n</i><b>,</b><i>m</i><b>}     </b>One or two numbers inside braces denote an <i>interval</i>
                  <i>expression</i>.  If there is one number in the braces, the
                  preceding regular expression <i>r</i> is repeated <i>n</i> times.  If
                  there are two numbers separated by a comma, <i>r</i> is repeated
                  <i>n</i> to <i>m</i> times.  If there is one number followed by a comma,
                  then <i>r</i> is repeated at least <i>n</i> times.

       <b>\y         </b>Matches the empty string at either the beginning or the
                  end of a word.

       <b>\B         </b>Matches the empty string within a word.

       <b>\&lt;         </b>Matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.

       <b>\&gt;         </b>Matches the empty string at the end of a word.

       <b>\s         </b>Matches any whitespace character.

       <b>\S         </b>Matches any nonwhitespace character.

       <b>\w         </b>Matches any word-constituent character (letter, digit, or
                  underscore).

       <b>\W         </b>Matches any character that is not word-constituent.

       <b>\`         </b>Matches the empty string at the beginning of a buffer
                  (string).

       <b>\'         </b>Matches the empty string at the end of a buffer.

       The escape sequences that are valid in string constants (see <b>String</b>
       <b>Constants</b>) are also valid in regular expressions.

       <i>Character classes</i> are a feature introduced in the POSIX standard.  A
       character class is a special notation for describing lists of
       characters that have a specific attribute, but where the actual
       characters themselves can vary from country to country and/or from
       character set to character set.  For example, the notion of what is
       an alphabetic character differs in the USA and in France.

       A character class is only valid in a regular expression <i>inside</i> the
       brackets of a character list.  Character classes consist of <b>[:</b>, a
       keyword denoting the class, and <b>:]</b>.  The character classes defined by
       the POSIX standard are:

       <b>[:alnum:]  </b>Alphanumeric characters.

       <b>[:alpha:]  </b>Alphabetic characters.

       <b>[:blank:]  </b>Space or tab characters.

       <b>[:cntrl:]  </b>Control characters.

       <b>[:digit:]  </b>Numeric characters.

       <b>[:graph:]  </b>Characters that are both printable and visible.  (A space
                  is printable, but not visible, while an <b>a </b>is both.)

       <b>[:lower:]  </b>Lowercase alphabetic characters.

       <b>[:print:]  </b>Printable characters (characters that are not control
                  characters.)

       <b>[:punct:]  </b>Punctuation characters (characters that are not letter,
                  digits, control characters, or space characters).

       <b>[:space:]  </b>Space characters (such as space, tab, and formfeed, to
                  name a few).

       <b>[:upper:]  </b>Uppercase alphabetic characters.

       <b>[:xdigit:] </b>Characters that are hexadecimal digits.

       For example, before the POSIX standard, to match alphanumeric
       characters, you would have had to write <b>/[A-Za-z0-9]/</b>.  If your
       character set had other alphabetic characters in it, this would not
       match them, and if your character set collated differently from
       ASCII, this might not even match the ASCII alphanumeric characters.
       With the POSIX character classes, you can write <b>/[[:alnum:]]/</b>, and
       this matches the alphabetic and numeric characters in your character
       set, no matter what it is.

       Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.
       These apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single
       symbols (called <i>collating elements</i>) that are represented with more
       than one character, as well as several characters that are equivalent
       for <i>collating</i>, or sorting, purposes.  (E.g., in French, a plain “e”
       and a grave-accented “e`” are equivalent.)

       Collating Symbols
              A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element
              enclosed in <b>[.  </b>and <b>.]</b>.  For example, if <b>ch </b>is a collating
              element, then <b>[[.ch.]]  </b>is a regular expression that matches
              this collating element, while <b>[ch] </b>is a regular expression
              that matches either <b>c </b>or <b>h</b>.

       Equivalence Classes
              An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of
              characters that are equivalent.  The name is enclosed in <b>[=</b>
              and <b>=]</b>.  For example, the name <b>e </b>might be used to represent
              all of “e”, “e´”, and “e`”.  In this case, <b>[[=e=]] </b>is a regular
              expression that matches any of <b>e</b>, <b>e´</b>, or <b>e`</b>.

       These features are very valuable in non-English speaking locales.
       The library functions that <i>gawk</i> uses for regular expression matching
       currently only recognize POSIX character classes; they do not
       recognize collating symbols or equivalence classes.

       The <b>\y</b>, <b>\B</b>, <b>\&lt;</b>, <b>\&gt;</b>, <b>\s</b>, <b>\S</b>, <b>\w</b>, <b>\W</b>, <b>\`</b>, and <b>\' </b>operators are specific
       to <i>gawk</i>; they are extensions based on facilities in the GNU regular
       expression libraries.

       The various command line options control how <i>gawk</i> interprets
       characters in regular expressions.

       No options
              In the default case, <i>gawk</i> provides all the facilities of POSIX
              regular expressions and the GNU regular expression operators
              described above.

       <b>--posix</b>
              Only POSIX regular expressions are supported, the GNU
              operators are not special.  (E.g., <b>\w </b>matches a literal <b>w</b>).

       <b>--traditional</b>
              Traditional UNIX <i>awk</i> regular expressions are matched.  The GNU
              operators are not special, and interval expressions are not
              available.  Characters described by octal and hexadecimal
              escape sequences are treated literally, even if they represent
              regular expression metacharacters.

       <b>--re-interval</b>
              Allow interval expressions in regular expressions, even if
              <b>--traditional </b>has been provided.

   <b>Actions</b>
       Action statements are enclosed in braces, <b>{ </b>and <b>}</b>.  Action statements
       consist of the usual assignment, conditional, and looping statements
       found in most languages.  The operators, control statements, and
       input/output statements available are patterned after those in C.

   <b>Operators</b>
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence, are:

       <b>(</b>...<b>)       </b>Grouping

       <b>$           </b>Field reference.

       <b>++ --       </b>Increment and decrement, both prefix and postfix.

       <b>^           </b>Exponentiation (<b>** </b>may also be used, and <b>**= </b>for the
                   assignment operator).

       <b>+ - !       </b>Unary plus, unary minus, and logical negation.

       <b>* / %       </b>Multiplication, division, and modulus.

       <b>+ -         </b>Addition and subtraction.

       <i>space</i>       String concatenation.

       <b>|   |&amp;      </b>Piped I/O for <b>getline</b>, <b>print</b>, and <b>printf</b>.

       <b>&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= != ==</b>
                   The regular relational operators.

       <b>~ !~        </b>Regular expression match, negated match.  <b>NOTE</b>: Do not
                   use a constant regular expression (<b>/foo/</b>) on the left-
                   hand side of a <b>~ </b>or <b>!~</b>.  Only use one on the right-hand
                   side.  The expression <b>/foo/ ~ </b><i>exp</i> has the same meaning as
                   <b>(($0 ~ /foo/) ~ </b><i>exp</i><b>)</b>.  This is usually <i>not</i> what you want.

       <b>in          </b>Array membership.

       <b>&amp;&amp;          </b>Logical AND.

       <b>||          </b>Logical OR.

       <b>?:          </b>The C conditional expression.  This has the form <i>expr1</i> <b>?</b>
                   <i>expr2</i> <b>: </b><i>expr3</i>.  If <i>expr1</i> is true, the value of the
                   expression is <i>expr2</i>, otherwise it is <i>expr3</i>.  Only one of
                   <i>expr2</i> and <i>expr3</i> is evaluated.

       <b>= += -= *= /= %= ^=</b>
                   Assignment.  Both absolute assignment <b>(</b><i>var</i> <b>= </b><i>value</i><b>) </b>and
                   operator-assignment (the other forms) are supported.

   <b>Control Statements</b>
       The control statements are as follows:

              <b>if (</b><i>condition</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i> [ <b>else </b><i>statement</i> ]
              <b>while (</b><i>condition</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>do </b><i>statement</i> <b>while (</b><i>condition</i><b>)</b>
              <b>for (</b><i>expr1</i><b>; </b><i>expr2</i><b>; </b><i>expr3</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>for (</b><i>var</i> <b>in </b><i>array</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>break</b>
              <b>continue</b>
              <b>delete </b><i>array</i><b>[</b><i>index</i><b>]</b>
              <b>delete </b><i>array</i>
              <b>exit </b>[ <i>expression</i> ]
              <b>{ </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>
              <b>switch (</b><i>expression</i><b>) {</b>
              <b>case </b><i>value</i><b>|</b><i>regex</i> <b>: </b><i>statement</i>
              <i>...</i>
              [ <b>default: </b><i>statement</i> ]
              <b>}</b>

   <b>I/O Statements</b>
       The input/output statements are as follows:

       <b>close(</b><i>file</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>]<b>)   </b>Close file, pipe or co-process.  The optional
                             <i>how</i> should only be used when closing one end of
                             a two-way pipe to a co-process.  It must be a
                             string value, either <b>"to" </b>or <b>"from"</b>.

       <b>getline               </b>Set <b>$0 </b>from next input record; set <b>NF</b>, <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>,
                             <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline &lt;</b><i>file</i>         Set <b>$0 </b>from next record of <i>file</i>; set <b>NF</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline </b><i>var</i>           Set <i>var</i> from next input record; set <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>,
                             <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline </b><i>var</i> <b>&lt;</b><i>file</i>     Set <i>var</i> from next record of <i>file</i>, <b>RT</b>.

       <i>command</i> <b>| getline </b>[<i>var</i>]
                             Run <i>command</i> piping the output either into <b>$0 </b>or
                             <i>var</i>, as above, and <b>RT</b>.

       <i>command</i> <b>|&amp; getline </b>[<i>var</i>]
                             Run <i>command</i> as a co-process piping the output
                             either into <b>$0 </b>or <i>var</i>, as above, and <b>RT</b>.  Co-
                             processes are a <i>gawk</i> extension.  (<i>command</i> can
                             also be a socket.  See the subsection <b>Special</b>
                             <b>File Names</b>, below.)

       <b>next                  </b>Stop processing the current input record.  The
                             next input record is read and processing starts
                             over with the first pattern in the AWK program.
                             Upon reaching the end of the input data, <i>gawk</i>
                             executes any <b>END </b>rule(s).

       <b>nextfile              </b>Stop processing the current input file.  The
                             next input record read comes from the next
                             input file.  <b>FILENAME </b>and <b>ARGIND </b>are updated,
                             <b>FNR </b>is reset to 1, and processing starts over
                             with the first pattern in the AWK program.
                             Upon reaching the end of the input data, <i>gawk</i>
                             executes any <b>END </b>rule(s).

       <b>print                 </b>Print the current record.  The output record is
                             terminated with the value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>print </b><i>expr-list</i>       Print expressions.  Each expression is
                             separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.  The output
                             record is terminated with the value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>print </b><i>expr-list</i> <b>&gt;</b><i>file</i> Print expressions on <i>file</i>.  Each expression is
                             separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.  The output
                             record is terminated with the value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>printf </b><i>fmt, expr-list</i> Format and print.  See <b>The </b><i>printf</i> <b>Statement</b>,
                             below.

       <b>printf </b><i>fmt, expr-list</i> <b>&gt;</b><i>file</i>
                             Format and print on <i>file</i>.

       <b>system(</b><i>cmd-line</i><b>)      </b>Execute the command <i>cmd-line</i>, and return the
                             exit status.  (This may not be available on
                             non-POSIX systems.)  See the manual for the
                             full details on the exit status.

       <b>fflush(</b>[<i>file</i>]<b>)        </b>Flush any buffers associated with the open
                             output file or pipe <i>file</i>.  If <i>file</i> is missing
                             or if it is the null string, then flush all
                             open output files and pipes.

       Additional output redirections are allowed for <b>print </b>and <b>printf</b>.

       <b>print ... &gt;&gt; </b><i>file</i>
              Appends output to the <i>file</i>.

       <b>print ... | </b><i>command</i>
              Writes on a pipe.

       <b>print ... |&amp; </b><i>command</i>
              Sends data to a co-process or socket.  (See also the
              subsection <b>Special File Names</b>, below.)

       The <b>getline </b>command returns 1 on success, 0 on end of file, and -1 on
       an error.  If the <a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> value indicates that the I/O operation may
       be retried, and <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>input</i><b>", "RETRY"] </b>is set, then -2 will be
       returned instead of -1, and further calls to <b>getline </b>may be
       attempted.  Upon an error, <b>ERRNO </b>is set to a string describing the
       problem.

       <b>NOTE</b>: Failure in opening a two-way socket results in a non-fatal
       error being returned to the calling function. If using a pipe, co-
       process, or socket to <b>getline</b>, or from <b>print </b>or <b>printf </b>within a loop,
       you <i>must</i> use <b>close() </b>to create new instances of the command or
       socket.  AWK does not automatically close pipes, sockets, or co-
       processes when they return EOF.

   <b>The </b><i>printf</i> <b>Statement</b>
       The AWK versions of the <b>printf </b>statement and <b>sprintf() </b>function (see
       below) accept the following conversion specification formats:

       <b>%c      </b>A single character.  If the argument used for <b>%c </b>is numeric,
               it is treated as a character and printed.  Otherwise, the
               argument is assumed to be a string, and the only first
               character of that string is printed.

       <b>%d</b>, <b>%i  </b>A decimal number (the integer part).

       <b>%e</b>, <b>%E  </b>A floating point number of the form [<b>-</b>]<i>d</i><b>.</b><i>dddddd</i><b>e</b>[<b>+-</b>]<i>dd</i>.  The
               <b>%E </b>format uses <b>E </b>instead of <b>e</b>.

       <b>%f</b>, <b>%F  </b>A floating point number of the form [<b>-</b>]<i>ddd</i><b>.</b><i>dddddd</i>.  If the
               system library supports it, <b>%F </b>is available as well. This is
               like <b>%f</b>, but uses capital letters for special “not a number”
               and “infinity” values. If <b>%F </b>is not available, <i>gawk</i> uses <b>%f</b>.

       <b>%g</b>, <b>%G  </b>Use <b>%e </b>or <b>%f </b>conversion, whichever is shorter, with
               nonsignificant zeros suppressed.  The <b>%G </b>format uses <b>%E</b>
               instead of <b>%e</b>.

       <b>%o      </b>An unsigned octal number (also an integer).

       <b>%u      </b>An unsigned decimal number (again, an integer).

       <b>%s      </b>A character string.

       <b>%x</b>, <b>%X  </b>An unsigned hexadecimal number (an integer).  The <b>%X </b>format
               uses <b>ABCDEF </b>instead of <b>abcdef</b>.

       <b>%%      </b>A single <b>% </b>character; no argument is converted.

       Optional, additional parameters may lie between the <b>% </b>and the control
       letter:

       <i>count</i><b>$ </b>Use the <i>count</i>'th argument at this point in the formatting.
              This is called a <i>positional specifier</i> and is intended
              primarily for use in translated versions of format strings,
              not in the original text of an AWK program.  It is a <i>gawk</i>
              extension.

       <b>-      </b>The expression should be left-justified within its field.

       <i>space</i>  For numeric conversions, prefix positive values with a space,
              and negative values with a minus sign.

       <b>+      </b>The plus sign, used before the width modifier (see below),
              says to always supply a sign for numeric conversions, even if
              the data to be formatted is positive.  The <b>+ </b>overrides the
              space modifier.

       <b>#      </b>Use an “alternate form” for certain control letters.  For <b>%o</b>,
              supply a leading zero.  For <b>%x</b>, and <b>%X</b>, supply a leading <b>0x </b>or
              <b>0X </b>for a nonzero result.  For <b>%e</b>, <b>%E</b>, <b>%f </b>and <b>%F</b>, the result
              always contains a decimal point.  For <b>%g</b>, and <b>%G</b>, trailing
              zeros are not removed from the result.

       <b>0      </b>A leading <b>0 </b>(zero) acts as a flag, that indicates output
              should be padded with zeroes instead of spaces.  This applies
              only to the numeric output formats.  This flag only has an
              effect when the field width is wider than the value to be
              printed.

       <b>'      </b>A single quote character instructs <i>gawk</i> to insert the locale's
              thousands-separator character into decimal numbers, and to
              also use the locale's decimal point character with floating
              point formats.  This requires correct locale support in the C
              library and in the definition of the current locale.

       <i>width</i>  The field should be padded to this width.  The field is
              normally padded with spaces.  With the <b>0 </b>flag, it is padded
              with zeroes.

       <b>.</b><i>prec</i>  A number that specifies the precision to use when printing.
              For the <b>%e</b>, <b>%E</b>, <b>%f </b>and <b>%F</b>, formats, this specifies the number
              of digits you want printed to the right of the decimal point.
              For the <b>%g</b>, and <b>%G </b>formats, it specifies the maximum number of
              significant digits.  For the <b>%d</b>, <b>%i</b>, <b>%o</b>, <b>%u</b>, <b>%x</b>, and <b>%X</b>
              formats, it specifies the minimum number of digits to print.
              For <b>%s</b>, it specifies the maximum number of characters from the
              string that should be printed.

       The dynamic <i>width</i> and <i>prec</i> capabilities of the ISO C <b>printf()</b>
       routines are supported.  A <b>* </b>in place of either the <i>width</i> or <i>prec</i>
       specifications causes their values to be taken from the argument list
       to <b>printf </b>or <b>sprintf()</b>.  To use a positional specifier with a dynamic
       width or precision, supply the <i>count</i><b>$ </b>after the <b>* </b>in the format
       string.  For example, <b>"%3$*2$.*1$s"</b>.

   <b>Special File Names</b>
       When doing I/O redirection from either <b>print </b>or <b>printf </b>into a file,
       or via <b>getline </b>from a file, <i>gawk</i> recognizes certain special filenames
       internally.  These filenames allow access to open file descriptors
       inherited from <i>gawk</i>'s parent process (usually the shell).  These file
       names may also be used on the command line to name data files.  The
       filenames are:

       <b>-           </b>The standard input.

       <b>/dev/stdin  </b>The standard input.

       <b>/dev/stdout </b>The standard output.

       <b>/dev/stderr </b>The standard error output.

       <b>/dev/fd/</b><i>n</i>   The file associated with the open file descriptor <i>n</i>.

       These are particularly useful for error messages.  For example:

              <b>print "You blew it!" &gt; "/dev/stderr"</b>

       whereas you would otherwise have to use

              <b>print "You blew it!" | "cat 1&gt;&amp;2"</b>

       The following special filenames may be used with the <b>|&amp; </b>co-process
       operator for creating TCP/IP network connections:

       <b>/inet/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet4/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet6/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
              Files for a TCP/IP connection on local port <i>lport</i> to remote
              host <i>rhost</i> on remote port <i>rport</i>.  Use a port of <b>0 </b>to have the
              system pick a port.  Use <b>/inet4 </b>to force an IPv4 connection,
              and <b>/inet6 </b>to force an IPv6 connection.  Plain <b>/inet </b>uses the
              system default (most likely IPv4).

       <b>/inet/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet4/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet6/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
              Similar, but use UDP/IP instead of TCP/IP.

   <b>Numeric Functions</b>
       AWK has the following built-in arithmetic functions:

       <b>atan2(</b><i>y</i><b>, </b><i>x</i><b>)   </b>Return the arctangent of <i>y/x</i> in radians.

       <b>cos(</b><i>expr</i><b>)     </b>Return the cosine of <i>expr</i>, which is in radians.

       <b>exp(</b><i>expr</i><b>)     </b>The exponential function.

       <b>int(</b><i>expr</i><b>)     </b>Truncate to integer.

       <b>intdiv(</b><i>num</i><b>, </b><i>denom</i><b>, </b><i>result</i><b>)</b>
                     Truncate <i>num</i> and <i>denom</i> to integers. Return the quotient
                     of <i>num</i> divided by <i>denom</i> in <i>result</i><b>["quotient"] </b>and the
                     remainder in in <i>result</i><b>["remainder"]</b>.  This is a <i>gawk</i>
                     extension, primarily of value when working with
                     arbitrarily large integers.

       <b>log(</b><i>expr</i><b>)     </b>The natural logarithm function.

       <b>rand()        </b>Return a random number <i>N</i>, between 0 and 1, such that 0
                     ≤ <i>N</i> &lt; 1.

       <b>sin(</b><i>expr</i><b>)     </b>Return the sine of <i>expr</i>, which is in radians.

       <b>sqrt(</b><i>expr</i><b>)    </b>Return the square root of <i>expr</i>.

       <b>srand(</b>[<i>expr</i>]<b>) </b>Use <i>expr</i> as the new seed for the random number
                     generator.  If no <i>expr</i> is provided, use the time of
                     day.  Return the previous seed for the random number
                     generator.

   <b>String Functions</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> has the following built-in string functions:

       <b>asort(</b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>d</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>] ]<b>) </b>Return the number of elements in the source
                               array <i>s</i>.  Sort the contents of <i>s</i> using <i>gawk</i>'s
                               normal rules for comparing values, and
                               replace the indices of the sorted values <i>s</i>
                               with sequential integers starting with 1. If
                               the optional destination array <i>d</i> is
                               specified, first duplicate <i>s</i> into <i>d</i>, and then
                               sort <i>d</i>, leaving the indices of the source
                               array <i>s</i> unchanged. The optional string <i>how</i>
                               controls the direction and the comparison
                               mode.  Valid values for <i>how</i> are any of the
                               strings valid for <b>PROCINFO["sorted_in"]</b>.  It
                               can also be the name of a user-defined
                               comparison function as described in
                               <b>PROCINFO["sorted_in"]</b>.

       <b>asorti(</b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>d</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Return the number of elements in the source
                               array <i>s</i>.  The behavior is the same as that of
                               <b>asort()</b>, except that the array <i>indices</i> are
                               used for sorting, not the array values.  When
                               done, the array is indexed numerically, and
                               the values are those of the original indices.
                               The original values are lost; thus provide a
                               second array if you wish to preserve the
                               original.  The purpose of the optional string
                               <i>how</i> is the same as described in <b>asort()</b>
                               above.

       <b>gensub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>h</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)   </b>Search the target string <i>t</i> for matches of the
                               regular expression <i>r</i>.  If <i>h</i> is a string
                               beginning with <b>g </b>or <b>G</b>, then replace all
                               matches of <i>r</i> with <i>s</i>.  Otherwise, <i>h</i> is a
                               number indicating which match of <i>r</i> to
                               replace.  If <i>t</i> is not supplied, use <b>$0</b>
                               instead.  Within the replacement text <i>s</i>, the
                               sequence <b>\</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a digit from 1 to 9,
                               may be used to indicate just the text that
                               matched the <i>n</i>'th parenthesized subexpression.
                               The sequence <b>\0 </b>represents the entire matched
                               text, as does the character <b>&amp;</b>.  Unlike <b>sub()</b>
                               and <b>gsub()</b>, the modified string is returned
                               as the result of the function, and the
                               original target string is <i>not</i> changed.

       <b>gsub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)        </b>For each substring matching the regular
                               expression <i>r</i> in the string <i>t</i>, substitute the
                               string <i>s</i>, and return the number of
                               substitutions.  If <i>t</i> is not supplied, use <b>$0</b>.
                               An <b>&amp; </b>in the replacement text is replaced with
                               the text that was actually matched.  Use <b>\&amp;</b>
                               to get a literal <b>&amp;</b>.  (This must be typed as
                               <b>"\\&amp;"</b>; see <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i>
                               for a fuller discussion of the rules for <b>&amp;</b>'s
                               and backslashes in the replacement text of
                               <b>sub()</b>, <b>gsub()</b>, and <b>gensub()</b>.)

       <b>index(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>t</i><b>)             </b>Return the index of the string <i>t</i> in the
                               string <i>s</i>, or 0 if <i>t</i> is not present.  (This
                               implies that character indices start at one.)
                               It is a fatal error to use a regexp constant
                               for <i>t</i>.

       <b>length(</b>[<i>s</i>]<b>)             </b>Return the length of the string <i>s</i>, or the
                               length of <b>$0 </b>if <i>s</i> is not supplied.  As a non-
                               standard extension, with an array argument,
                               <b>length() </b>returns the number of elements in
                               the array.

       <b>match(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>a</i>]<b>)       </b>Return the position in <i>s</i> where the regular
                               expression <i>r</i> occurs, or 0 if <i>r</i> is not
                               present, and set the values of <b>RSTART </b>and
                               <b>RLENGTH</b>.  Note that the argument order is the
                               same as for the <b>~ </b>operator: <i>str</i> <b>~ </b><i>re</i>.  If
                               array <i>a</i> is provided, <i>a</i> is cleared and then
                               elements 1 through <i>n</i> are filled with the
                               portions of <i>s</i> that match the corresponding
                               parenthesized subexpression in <i>r</i>.  The 0'th
                               element of <i>a</i> contains the portion of <i>s</i>
                               matched by the entire regular expression <i>r</i>.
                               Subscripts <b>a[</b><i>n</i><b>, "start"]</b>, and <b>a[</b><i>n</i><b>, "length"]</b>
                               provide the starting index in the string and
                               length respectively, of each matching
                               substring.

       <b>patsplit(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>a</i> [<b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>seps</i>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Split the string <i>s</i> into the array <i>a</i> and the
                               separators array <i>seps</i> on the regular
                               expression <i>r</i>, and return the number of
                               fields.  Element values are the portions of <i>s</i>
                               that matched <i>r</i>.  The value of <b>seps[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>is the
                               possibly null separator that appeared after
                               <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>]</b>.  The value of <b>seps[0] </b>is the possibly
                               null leading separator.  If <i>r</i> is omitted,
                               <b>FPAT </b>is used instead.  The arrays <i>a</i> and <i>seps</i>
                               are cleared first.  Splitting behaves
                               identically to field splitting with <b>FPAT</b>,
                               described above.

       <b>split(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>a</i> [<b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>seps</i>] ]<b>)</b>
                               Split the string <i>s</i> into the array <i>a</i> and the
                               separators array <i>seps</i> on the regular
                               expression <i>r</i>, and return the number of
                               fields.  If <i>r</i> is omitted, <b>FS </b>is used instead.
                               The arrays <i>a</i> and <i>seps</i> are cleared first.
                               <b>seps[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>is the field separator matched by <i>r</i>
                               between <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>and <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>+1]</b>.  If <i>r</i> is a single
                               space, then leading whitespace in <i>s</i> goes into
                               the extra array element <b>seps[0] </b>and trailing
                               whitespace goes into the extra array element
                               <b>seps[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>, where <i>n</i> is the return value of
                               <b>split(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>a</i><b>, </b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>seps</i><b>)</b>.  Splitting behaves
                               identically to field splitting, described
                               above.

       <b>sprintf(</b><i>fmt</i><b>, </b><i>expr-list</i><b>) </b>Print <i>expr-list</i> according to <i>fmt</i>, and return
                               the resulting string.

       <b>strtonum(</b><i>str</i><b>)           </b>Examine <i>str</i>, and return its numeric value.
                               If <i>str</i> begins with a leading <b>0</b>, treat it as
                               an octal number.  If <i>str</i> begins with a
                               leading <b>0x </b>or <b>0X</b>, treat it as a hexadecimal
                               number.  Otherwise, assume it is a decimal
                               number.

       <b>sub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)         </b>Just like <b>gsub()</b>, but replace only the first
                               matching substring.

       <b>substr(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>i</i> [<b>, </b><i>n</i>]<b>)      </b>Return the at most <i>n</i>-character substring of <i>s</i>
                               starting at <i>i</i>.  If <i>n</i> is omitted, use the rest
                               of <i>s</i>.

       <b>tolower(</b><i>str</i><b>)            </b>Return a copy of the string <i>str</i>, with all the
                               uppercase characters in <i>str</i> translated to
                               their corresponding lowercase counterparts.
                               Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

       <b>toupper(</b><i>str</i><b>)            </b>Return a copy of the string <i>str</i>, with all the
                               lowercase characters in <i>str</i> translated to
                               their corresponding uppercase counterparts.
                               Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

       <i>Gawk</i> is multibyte aware.  This means that <b>index()</b>, <b>length()</b>, <b>substr()</b>
       and <b>match() </b>all work in terms of characters, not bytes.

   <b>Time Functions</b>
       Since one of the primary uses of AWK programs is processing log files
       that contain time stamp information, <i>gawk</i> provides the following
       functions for obtaining time stamps and formatting them.

       <b>mktime(</b><i>datespec</i> [<b>, </b><i>utc-flag</i>]<b>)</b>
                 Turn <i>datespec</i> into a time stamp of the same form as
                 returned by <b>systime()</b>, and return the result.  The <i>datespec</i>
                 is a string of the form <i>YYYY MM DD HH MM SS[ DST]</i>.  The
                 contents of the string are six or seven numbers
                 representing respectively the full year including century,
                 the month from 1 to 12, the day of the month from 1 to 31,
                 the hour of the day from 0 to 23, the minute from 0 to 59,
                 the second from 0 to 60, and an optional daylight saving
                 flag.  The values of these numbers need not be within the
                 ranges specified; for example, an hour of -1 means 1 hour
                 before midnight.  The origin-zero Gregorian calendar is
                 assumed, with year 0 preceding year 1 and year -1 preceding
                 year 0.  If <i>utc-flag</i> is present and is non-zero or non-
                 null, the time is assumed to be in the UTC time zone;
                 otherwise, the time is assumed to be in the local time
                 zone.  If the daylight saving flag is positive, the time is
                 assumed to be daylight saving time; if zero, the time is
                 assumed to be standard time; and if negative (the default),
                 <b>mktime() </b>attempts to determine whether daylight saving time
                 is in effect for the specified time.  If <i>datespec</i> does not
                 contain enough elements or if the resulting time is out of
                 range, <b>mktime() </b>returns -1.

       <b>strftime(</b>[<i>format</i> [<b>, </b><i>timestamp</i>[<b>, </b><i>utc-flag</i>]]]<b>)</b>
                 Format <i>timestamp</i> according to the specification in <i>format</i>.
                 If <i>utc-flag</i> is present and is non-zero or non-null, the
                 result is in UTC, otherwise the result is in local time.
                 The <i>timestamp</i> should be of the same form as returned by
                 <b>systime()</b>.  If <i>timestamp</i> is missing, the current time of
                 day is used.  If <i>format</i> is missing, a default format
                 equivalent to the output of <a href="date.1.html">date(1)</a> is used.  The default
                 format is available in <b>PROCINFO["strftime"]</b>.  See the
                 specification for the <b>strftime() </b>function in ISO C for the
                 format conversions that are guaranteed to be available.

       <b>systime() </b>Return the current time of day as the number of seconds
                 since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX systems).

   <b>Bit Manipulations Functions</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> supplies the following bit manipulation functions.  They work by
       converting double-precision floating point values to <b>uintmax_t</b>
       integers, doing the operation, and then converting the result back to
       floating point.

       <b>NOTE</b>: Passing negative operands to any of these functions causes a
       fatal error.

       The functions are:

       <b>and(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>) </b>Return the bitwise AND of the values provided in
                           the argument list.  There must be at least two.

       <b>compl(</b><i>val</i><b>)          </b>Return the bitwise complement of <i>val</i>.

       <b>lshift(</b><i>val</i><b>, </b><i>count</i><b>)  </b>Return the value of <i>val</i>, shifted left by <i>count</i>
                           bits.

       <b>or(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>)  </b>Return the bitwise OR of the values provided in
                           the argument list.  There must be at least two.

       <b>rshift(</b><i>val</i><b>, </b><i>count</i><b>)  </b>Return the value of <i>val</i>, shifted right by <i>count</i>
                           bits.

       <b>xor(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>) </b>Return the bitwise XOR of the values provided in
                           the argument list.  There must be at least two.

   <b>Type Functions</b>
       The following function is for use with multidimensional arrays.

       <b>isarray(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
              Return true if <i>x</i> is an array, false otherwise.

       You can tell the type of any variable or array element with the
       following function:

       <b>typeof(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
              Return a string indicating the type of <i>x</i>.  The string will be
              one of <b>"array"</b>, <b>"number"</b>, <b>"regexp"</b>, <b>"string"</b>, <b>"strnum"</b>, or
              <b>"undefined"</b>.

   <b>Internationalization Functions</b>
       The following functions may be used from within your AWK program for
       translating strings at run-time.  For full details, see <i>GAWK:</i>
       <i>Effective AWK Programming</i>.

       <b>bindtextdomain(</b><i>directory</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i>]<b>)</b>
              Specify the directory where <i>gawk</i> looks for the <b>.gmo </b>files, in
              case they will not or cannot be placed in the ``standard''
              locations (e.g., during testing).  It returns the directory
              where <i>domain</i> is ``bound.''
              The default <i>domain</i> is the value of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  If <i>directory</i>
              is the null string (<b>""</b>), then <b>bindtextdomain() </b>returns the
              current binding for the given <i>domain</i>.

       <b>dcgettext(</b><i>string</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i> [<b>, </b><i>category</i>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the translation of <i>string</i> in text domain <i>domain</i> for
              locale category <i>category</i>.  The default value for <i>domain</i> is the
              current value of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  The default value for <i>category</i>
              is <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.
              If you supply a value for <i>category</i>, it must be a string equal
              to one of the known locale categories described in <i>GAWK:</i>
              <i>Effective AWK Programming</i>.  You must also supply a text
              domain.  Use <b>TEXTDOMAIN </b>if you want to use the current domain.

       <b>dcngettext(</b><i>string1</i><b>, </b><i>string2</i><b>, </b><i>number</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i> [<b>, </b><i>category</i>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the plural form used for <i>number</i> of the translation of
              <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> in text domain <i>domain</i> for locale category
              <i>category</i>.  The default value for <i>domain</i> is the current value
              of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  The default value for <i>category</i> is
              <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.
              If you supply a value for <i>category</i>, it must be a string equal
              to one of the known locale categories described in <i>GAWK:</i>
              <i>Effective AWK Programming</i>.  You must also supply a text
              domain.  Use <b>TEXTDOMAIN </b>if you want to use the current domain.

<h2><a id="USER-DEFINED_FUNCTIONS" href="#USER-DEFINED_FUNCTIONS"></a>USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              <b>function </b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameter list</i><b>) { </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>

       Functions are executed when they are called from within expressions
       in either patterns or actions.  Actual parameters supplied in the
       function call are used to instantiate the formal parameters declared
       in the function.  Arrays are passed by reference, other variables are
       passed by value.

       Since functions were not originally part of the AWK language, the
       provision for local variables is rather clumsy: They are declared as
       extra parameters in the parameter list.  The convention is to
       separate local variables from real parameters by extra spaces in the
       parameter list.  For example:

              <b>function  f(p, q,     a, b)   # a and b are local</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>/abc/     { ... ; f(1, 2) ; ... }</b>

       The left parenthesis in a function call is required to immediately
       follow the function name, without any intervening whitespace.  This
       avoids a syntactic ambiguity with the concatenation operator.  This
       restriction does not apply to the built-in functions listed above.

       Functions may call each other and may be recursive.  Function
       parameters used as local variables are initialized to the null string
       and the number zero upon function invocation.

       Use <b>return </b><i>expr</i> to return a value from a function.  The return value
       is undefined if no value is provided, or if the function returns by
       “falling off” the end.

       As a <i>gawk</i> extension, functions may be called indirectly. To do this,
       assign the name of the function to be called, as a string, to a
       variable.  Then use the variable as if it were the name of a
       function, prefixed with an <b>@ </b>sign, like so:
              <b>function myfunc()</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>print "myfunc called"</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>{    ...</b>
                   <b>the_func = "myfunc"</b>
                   <b>@the_func()    # call through the_func to myfunc</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>
       As of version 4.1.2, this works with user-defined functions, built-in
       functions, and extension functions.

       If <b>--lint </b>has been provided, <i>gawk</i> warns about calls to undefined
       functions at parse time, instead of at run time.  Calling an
       undefined function at run time is a fatal error.

       The word <b>func </b>may be used in place of <b>function</b>, although this is
       deprecated.

       You can dynamically add new built-in functions to the running <i>gawk</i>

<h2><a id="INTERNATIONALIZATION" href="#INTERNATIONALIZATION"></a>INTERNATIONALIZATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       String constants are sequences of characters enclosed in double
       quotes.  In non-English speaking environments, it is possible to mark
       strings in the AWK program as requiring translation to the local
       natural language. Such strings are marked in the AWK program with a
       leading underscore (“_”).  For example,

              <b>gawk 'BEGIN { print "hello, world" }'</b>

       always prints <b>hello, world</b>.  But,

              <b>gawk 'BEGIN { print _"hello, world" }'</b>

       might print <b>bonjour, monde </b>in France.

       There are several steps involved in producing and running a
       localizable AWK program.

       1.  Add a <b>BEGIN </b>action to assign a value to the <b>TEXTDOMAIN </b>variable
           to set the text domain to a name associated with your program:

                <b>BEGIN { TEXTDOMAIN = "myprog" }</b>

           This allows <i>gawk</i> to find the <b>.gmo </b>file associated with your
           program.  Without this step, <i>gawk</i> uses the <b>messages </b>text domain,
           which likely does not contain translations for your program.

       2.  Mark all strings that should be translated with leading
           underscores.

       3.  If necessary, use the <b>dcgettext() </b>and/or <b>bindtextdomain()</b>
           functions in your program, as appropriate.

       4.  Run <b>gawk --gen-pot -f myprog.awk &gt; myprog.pot </b>to generate a <b>.pot</b>
           file for your program.

       5.  Provide appropriate translations, and build and install the
           corresponding <b>.gmo </b>files.

       The internationalization features are described in full detail in
       <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="POSIX_COMPATIBILITY" href="#POSIX_COMPATIBILITY"></a>POSIX COMPATIBILITY  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       A primary goal for <i>gawk</i> is compatibility with the POSIX standard, as
       well as with the latest version of Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i>.  To this
       end, <i>gawk</i> incorporates the following user visible features which are
       not described in the AWK book, but are part of the Brian Kernighan's
       version of <i>awk</i>, and are in the POSIX standard.

       The book indicates that command line variable assignment happens when
       <i>awk</i> would otherwise open the argument as a file, which is after the
       <b>BEGIN </b>rule is executed.  However, in earlier implementations, when
       such an assignment appeared before any file names, the assignment
       would happen <i>before</i> the <b>BEGIN </b>rule was run.  Applications came to
       depend on this “feature.”  When <i>awk</i> was changed to match its
       documentation, the <b>-v </b>option for assigning variables before program
       execution was added to accommodate applications that depended upon
       the old behavior.  (This feature was agreed upon by both the Bell
       Laboratories and the GNU developers.)

       When processing arguments, <i>gawk</i> uses the special option “--” to
       signal the end of arguments.  In compatibility mode, it warns about
       but otherwise ignores undefined options.  In normal operation, such
       arguments are passed on to the AWK program for it to process.

       The AWK book does not define the return value of <b>srand()</b>.  The POSIX
       standard has it return the seed it was using, to allow keeping track
       of random number sequences.  Therefore <b>srand() </b>in <i>gawk</i> also returns
       its current seed.

       Other new features are: The use of multiple <b>-f </b>options (from MKS
       <i>awk</i>); the <b>ENVIRON </b>array; the <b>\a</b>, and <b>\v </b>escape sequences (done
       originally in <i>gawk</i> and fed back into the Bell Laboratories version);
       the <b>tolower() </b>and <b>toupper() </b>built-in functions (from the Bell
       Laboratories version); and the ISO C conversion specifications in
       <b>printf </b>(done first in the Bell Laboratories version).

<h2><a id="HISTORICAL_FEATURES" href="#HISTORICAL_FEATURES"></a>HISTORICAL FEATURES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There is one feature of historical AWK implementations that <i>gawk</i>
       supports: It is possible to call the <b>length() </b>built-in function not
       only with no argument, but even without parentheses!  Thus,

              <b>a = length     # Holy Algol 60, Batman!</b>

       is the same as either of

              <b>a = length()</b>
              <b>a = length($0)</b>

       Using this feature is poor practice, and <i>gawk</i> issues a warning about
       its use if <b>--lint </b>is specified on the command line.
</pre>
<h2><a id="GNU_EXTENSIONS" href="#GNU_EXTENSIONS"></a>GNU EXTENSIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> has a too-large number of extensions to POSIX <i>awk</i>.  They are
       described in this section.  All the extensions described here can be
       disabled by invoking <i>gawk</i> with the <b>--traditional </b>or <b>--posix </b>options.

       The following features of <i>gawk</i> are not available in POSIX <i>awk</i>.

       · No path search is performed for files named via the <b>-f </b>option.
         Therefore the <b>AWKPATH </b>environment variable is not special.

       · There is no facility for doing file inclusion (<i>gawk</i>'s <b>@include</b>
         mechanism).

       · There is no facility for dynamically adding new functions written
         in C (<i>gawk</i>'s <b>@load </b>mechanism).

       · The <b>\x </b>escape sequence.  (Disabled with <b>--posix</b>.)

       · The ability to continue lines after <b>?  </b>and <b>:</b>.  (Disabled with
         <b>--posix</b>.)

       · Octal and hexadecimal constants in AWK programs.

       · The <b>ARGIND</b>, <b>BINMODE</b>, <b>ERRNO</b>, <b>LINT</b>, <b>RT </b>and <b>TEXTDOMAIN </b>variables are
         not special.

       · The <b>IGNORECASE </b>variable and its side-effects are not available.

       · The <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>variable and fixed-width field splitting.

       · The <b>FPAT </b>variable and field splitting based on field values.

       · The <b>PROCINFO </b>array is not available.

       · The use of <b>RS </b>as a regular expression.

       · The special file names available for I/O redirection are not
         recognized.

       · The <b>|&amp; </b>operator for creating co-processes.

       · The <b>BEGINFILE </b>and <b>ENDFILE </b>special patterns are not available.

       · The ability to split out individual characters using the null
         string as the value of <b>FS</b>, and as the third argument to <b>split()</b>.

       · An optional fourth argument to <b>split() </b>to receive the separator
         texts.

       · The optional second argument to the <b>close() </b>function.

       · The optional third argument to the <b>match() </b>function.

       · The ability to use positional specifiers with <b>printf </b>and <b>sprintf()</b>.

       · The ability to pass an array to <b>length()</b>.

       · The <b>and()</b>, <b>asort()</b>, <b>asorti()</b>, <b>bindtextdomain()</b>, <b>compl()</b>,
         <b>dcgettext()</b>, <b>dcngettext()</b>, <b>gensub()</b>, <b>lshift()</b>, <b>mktime()</b>, <b>or()</b>,
         <b>patsplit()</b>, <b>rshift()</b>, <b>strftime()</b>, <b>strtonum()</b>, <b>systime() </b>and <b>xor()</b>
         functions.

       · Localizable strings.

       The AWK book does not define the return value of the <b>close()</b>
       function.  <i>Gawk</i>'s <b>close() </b>returns the value from <a href="../man3/fclose.3.html">fclose(3)</a>, or
       <a href="../man3/pclose.3.html">pclose(3)</a>, when closing an output file or pipe, respectively.  It
       returns the process's exit status when closing an input pipe.  The
       return value is -1 if the named file, pipe or co-process was not
       opened with a redirection.

       When <i>gawk</i> is invoked with the <b>--traditional </b>option, if the <i>fs</i>
       argument to the <b>-F </b>option is “t”, then <b>FS </b>is set to the tab
       character.  Note that typing <b>gawk -F\t ...  </b>simply causes the shell
       to quote the “t,” and does not pass “\t” to the <b>-F </b>option.  Since
       this is a rather ugly special case, it is not the default behavior.
       This behavior also does not occur if <b>--posix </b>has been specified.  To
       really get a tab character as the field separator, it is best to use
       single quotes: <b>gawk -F'\t' ...</b>.

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>AWKPATH </b>environment variable can be used to provide a list of
       directories that <i>gawk</i> searches when looking for files named via the
       <b>-f</b>, --file<b>, -i </b>and <b>--include </b>options.  If the initial search fails,
       the path is searched again after appending <b>.awk </b>to the filename.

       The <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>environment variable can be used to provide a list of
       directories that <i>gawk</i> searches when looking for files named via the
       <b>-l </b>and <b>--load </b>options.

       The <b>GAWK_READ_TIMEOUT </b>environment variable can be used to specify a
       timeout in milliseconds for reading input from a terminal, pipe or
       two-way communication including sockets.

       For connection to a remote host via socket, <b>GAWK_SOCK_RETRIES</b>
       controls the number of retries, and <b>GAWK_MSEC_SLEEP </b>and the interval
       between retries.  The interval is in milliseconds. On systems that do

       of seconds.

       If <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>exists in the environment, then <i>gawk</i> behaves
       exactly as if <b>--posix </b>had been specified on the command line.  If
       <b>--lint </b>has been specified, <i>gawk</i> issues a warning message to this
       effect.

       If the <b>exit </b>statement is used with a value, then <i>gawk</i> exits with the
       numeric value given to it.

       Otherwise, if there were no problems during execution, <i>gawk</i> exits
       with the value of the C constant <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.  This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, <i>gawk</i> exits with the value of the C constant
       <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.  This is usually one.

       If <i>gawk</i> exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2.  On
       non-POSIX systems, this value may be mapped to <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.

<h2><a id="VERSION_INFORMATION" href="#VERSION_INFORMATION"></a>VERSION INFORMATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This man page documents <i>gawk</i>, version 4.1.
</pre>
<h2><a id="AUTHORS" href="#AUTHORS"></a>AUTHORS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The original version of UNIX <i>awk</i> was designed and implemented by
       Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell
       Laboratories.  Brian Kernighan continues to maintain and enhance it.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software Foundation, wrote
       <i>gawk</i>, to be compatible with the original version of <i>awk</i> distributed
       in Seventh Edition UNIX.  John Woods contributed a number of bug
       fixes.  David Trueman, with contributions from Arnold Robbins, made
       <i>gawk</i> compatible with the new version of UNIX <i>awk</i>.  Arnold Robbins is
       the current maintainer.

       See <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i> for a full list of the
       contributors to <i>gawk</i> and its documentation.

       See the <b>README </b>file in the <i>gawk</i> distribution for up-to-date
       information about maintainers and which ports are currently
       supported.

<h2><a id="BUG_REPORTS" href="#BUG_REPORTS"></a>BUG REPORTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If you find a bug in <i>gawk</i>, please send electronic mail to <b>bug-</b>
       <b>gawk@gnu.org</b>.  Please include your operating system and its revision,
       the version of <i>gawk</i> (from <b>gawk --version</b>), which C compiler you used
       to compile it, and a test program and data that are as small as
       possible for reproducing the problem.

       Before sending a bug report, please do the following things.  First,
       verify that you have the latest version of <i>gawk</i>.  Many bugs (usually
       subtle ones) are fixed at each release, and if yours is out of date,
       the problem may already have been solved.  Second, please see if
       setting the environment variable <b>LC_ALL </b>to <b>LC_ALL=C </b>causes things to
       behave as you expect. If so, it's a locale issue, and may or may not
       really be a bug.  Finally, please read this man page and the
       reference manual carefully to be sure that what you think is a bug
       really is, instead of just a quirk in the language.

       Whatever you do, do <b>NOT </b>post a bug report in <b>comp.lang.awk</b>.  While
       the <i>gawk</i> developers occasionally read this newsgroup, posting bug
       reports there is an unreliable way to report bugs.  Instead, please
       use the electronic mail addresses given above.  Really.

       If you're using a GNU/Linux or BSD-based system, you may wish to
       submit a bug report to the vendor of your distribution.  That's fine,
       but please send a copy to the official email address as well, since
       there's no guarantee that the bug report will be forwarded to the
       <i>gawk</i> maintainer.
