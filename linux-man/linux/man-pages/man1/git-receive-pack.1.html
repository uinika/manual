<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Invoked by <i>git send-pack</i> and updates the repository with the
       information fed from the remote end.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI
       for the protocol is on the <i>git send-pack</i> side, and the program pair
       is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository. For pull
       operations, see <a href="git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>.

       The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
       (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local
       end <i>git-receive-pack</i> runs, but to the user who is sitting at the
       send-pack end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)

       There are other real-world examples of using update and post-update
       hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.

       <i>git-receive-pack</i> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
       option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they
       are not fast-forwards.

       A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak its
       behavior, see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

<h2><a id="PRE-RECEIVE_HOOK" href="#PRE-RECEIVE_HOOK"></a>PRE-RECEIVE HOOK  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file exists
       and is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The
       standard input of the hook will be one line per ref to be updated:

           sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF

       The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head
       this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 values before each refname
       are the object names for the refname before and after the update.
       Refs to be created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to
       be deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and
       sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.

       When accepting a signed push (see <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>), the signed push
       certificate is stored in a blob and an environment variable
       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT </b>can be consulted for its object name. See the
       description of <b>post-receive </b>hook for an example. In addition, the
       certificate is verified using GPG and the result is exported with the
       following environment variables:

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER</b>
           The name and the e-mail address of the owner of the key that
           signed the push certificate.

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_KEY</b>
           The GPG key ID of the key that signed the push certificate.

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS</b>
           The status of GPG verification of the push certificate, using the
           same mnemonic as used in <b>%G?  </b>format of <b>git log </b>family of
           commands (see <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>).

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE</b>
           The nonce string the process asked the signer to include in the
           push certificate. If this does not match the value recorded on
           the "nonce" header in the push certificate, it may indicate that
           the certificate is a valid one that is being replayed from a
           separate "git push" session.

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b>

           <b>UNSOLICITED</b>
               "git push --signed" sent a nonce when we did not ask it to
               send one.

           <b>MISSING</b>
               "git push --signed" did not send any nonce header.

           <b>BAD</b>
               "git push --signed" sent a bogus nonce.

           <b>OK</b>
               "git push --signed" sent the nonce we asked it to send.

           <b>SLOP</b>
               "git push --signed" sent a nonce different from what we asked
               it to send now, but in a previous session. See
               <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP </b>environment variable.

       <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b>
           "git push --signed" sent a nonce different from what we asked it
           to send now, but in a different session whose starting time is
           different by this many seconds from the current session. Only
           meaningful when <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS </b>says <b>SLOP</b>. Also read
           about <b>receive.certNonceSlop </b>variable in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

       This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any
       fast-forward checks are performed.

       If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no updates
       will be performed, and the update, post-receive and post-update hooks
       will not be invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if
       the update is not to be supported.

       See the notes on the quarantine environment below.
</pre>
<h2><a id="UPDATE_HOOK" href="#UPDATE_HOOK"></a>UPDATE HOOK  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and
       is executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three parameters:

           $GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new

       The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
       head this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 arguments are the
       object names for the refname before and after the update. Note that
       the hook is called before the refname is updated, so either sha1-old
       is 0{40} (meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what
       is recorded in refname.

       The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow
       updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.

       Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not
       ensure the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite.
       As such it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email) from this
       hook. Consider using the post-receive hook instead.
</pre>
<h2><a id="POST-RECEIVE_HOOK" href="#POST-RECEIVE_HOOK"></a>POST-RECEIVE HOOK  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any ref
       update was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists
       and is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The
       standard input of the hook will be one line for each successfully
       updated ref:

           sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF

       The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head
       this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 values before each refname
       are the object names for the refname before and after the update.
       Refs that were created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs
       that were deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise
       sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.

       The <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT* </b>environment variables can be inspected, just as in
       <b>pre-receive </b>hook, after accepting a signed push.

       Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates
       to the repository. This example script sends one mail message per ref
       listing the commits pushed to the repository, and logs the push
       certificates of signed pushes with good signatures to a logger
       service:

           #!/bin/sh
           # mail out commit update information.
           while read oval nval ref
           do
                   if expr "$oval" : '0*$' &gt;/dev/null
                   then
                           echo "Created a new ref, with the following commits:"
                           git rev-list --pretty "$nval"
                   else
                           echo "New commits:"
                           git rev-list --pretty "$nval" "^$oval"
                   fi |
                   mail -s "Changes to ref $ref" commit-list@mydomain
           done
           # log signed push certificate, if any
           if test -n "${GIT_PUSH_CERT-}" &amp;&amp; test ${GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS} = G
           then
                   (
                           echo expected nonce is ${GIT_PUSH_NONCE}
                           git cat-file blob ${GIT_PUSH_CERT}
                   ) | mail -s "push certificate from $GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER" push-log@mydomain
           fi
           exit 0

       The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
       non-zero exit code will generate an error message.

       Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when this
       hook runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies the ref
       after it was updated by <i>git-receive-pack</i>, but before the hook was
       able to evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new
       rather than the current value of refname.
</pre>
<h2><a id="POST-UPDATE_HOOK" href="#POST-UPDATE_HOOK"></a>POST-UPDATE HOOK  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and if
       $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then
       post-update will be called with the list of refs that have been
       updated. This can be used to implement any repository wide cleanup
       tasks.

       The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing
       left for <i>git-receive-pack</i> to do at that point is to exit itself
       anyway.

       This hook can be used, for example, to run <b>git update-server-info </b>if
       the repository is packed and is served via a dumb transport.

           #!/bin/sh
           exec git update-server-info
</pre>
<h2><a id="QUARANTINE_ENVIRONMENT" href="#QUARANTINE_ENVIRONMENT"></a>QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       When <b>receive-pack </b>takes in objects, they are placed into a temporary
       "quarantine" directory within the <b>$GIT_DIR/objects </b>directory and
       migrated into the main object store only after the <b>pre-receive </b>hook
       has completed. If the push fails before then, the temporary directory
       is removed entirely.

       This has a few user-visible effects and caveats:

        1. Pushes which fail due to problems with the incoming pack, missing
           objects, or due to the <b>pre-receive </b>hook will not leave any
           on-disk data. This is usually helpful to prevent repeated failed
           pushes from filling up your disk, but can make debugging more
           challenging.

        2. Any objects created by the <b>pre-receive </b>hook will be created in
           the quarantine directory (and migrated only if it succeeds).

        3. The <b>pre-receive </b>hook MUST NOT update any refs to point to
           quarantined objects. Other programs accessing the repository will
           not be able to see the objects (and if the pre-receive hook
           fails, those refs would become corrupted). For safety, any ref
           updates from within <b>pre-receive </b>are automatically rejected.
