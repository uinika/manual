     <b>tmux </b>is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be
     created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  <b>tmux </b>may be
     detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then
     later reattached.

     When <b>tmux </b>is started it creates a new <i>session</i> with a single <i>window</i> and
     displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows
     information on the current session and is used to enter interactive
     commands.

     A session is a single collection of <i>pseudo terminals</i> under the manage‐
     ment of <b>tmux</b>.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A
     window occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular
     panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual
     page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number
     of <b>tmux </b>instances may connect to the same session, and any number of
     windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are
     killed, <b>tmux </b>exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection
     (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
     ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  <b>tmux </b>may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In <b>tmux</b>, a session is displayed on screen by a <i>client</i> and all sessions
     are managed by a single <i>server</i>.  The server and each client are sepa‐
     rate processes which communicate through a socket in <i>/tmp</i>.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-2            </b>Force <b>tmux </b>to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     <b>-C            </b>Start in control mode (see the <i>CONTROL MODE</i> section).
                   Given twice (<b>-CC</b>) disables echo.

     <b>-c </b><i>shell-command</i>
                   Execute <i>shell-command</i> using the default shell.  If neces‐
                   sary, the <b>tmux </b>server will be started to retrieve the
                   <b>default-shell </b>option.  This option is for compatibility
                   with sh(1) when <b>tmux </b>is used as a login shell.

     <b>-f </b><i>file</i>       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default,
                   <b>tmux </b>loads the system configuration file from
                   <i>@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf</i>, if present, then looks for a user
                   configuration file at <i>~/.tmux.conf</i>.

                   The configuration file is a set of <b>tmux </b>commands which
                   are executed in sequence when the server is first
                   started.  <b>tmux </b>loads configuration files once when the
                   server process has started.  The <b>source-file </b>command may
                   be used to load a file later.

                   <b>tmux </b>shows any error messages from commands in configura‐
                   tion files in the first session created, and continues to
                   process the rest of the configuration file.

     <b>-L </b><i>socket-name</i>
                   <b>tmux </b>stores the server socket in a directory under
                   TMUX_TMPDIR or <i>/tmp</i> if it is unset.  The default socket
                   is named <i>default</i>.  This option allows a different socket
                   name to be specified, allowing several independent <b>tmux</b>
                   servers to be run.  Unlike <b>-S </b>a full path is not neces‐
                   sary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal
                   may be sent to the <b>tmux </b>server process to recreate it
                   (note that this will fail if any parent directories are
                   missing).

     <b>-l            </b>Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no
                   effect and is for compatibility with other shells when
                   using tmux as a login shell.

     <b>-S </b><i>socket-path</i>
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If
                   <b>-S </b>is specified, the default socket directory is not used
                   and any <b>-L </b>flag is ignored.

     <b>-u            </b>When starting, <b>tmux </b>looks for the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and
                   LANG environment variables: if the first found contains
                   ‘UTF-8’, then the terminal is assumed to support UTF-8.
                   This is not always correct: the <b>-u </b>flag explicitly
                   informs <b>tmux </b>that UTF-8 is supported.

                   Note that <b>tmux </b>itself always accepts UTF-8; this controls
                   whether it will send UTF-8 characters to the terminal it
                   is running (if not, they are replaced by ‘_’).

     <b>-v            </b>Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into
                   <i>tmux-client-PID.log</i> and <i>tmux-server-PID.log</i> files in the
                   current directory, where <i>PID</i> is the PID of the server or
                   client process.

     <b>-V            </b>Report the <b>tmux </b>version.

                   If <b>-v </b>is specified twice, an additional <i>tmux-out-PID.log</i>
                   file is generated with a copy of everything <b>tmux </b>writes
                   to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the <b>tmux </b>server process
                   to toggle logging between on (as if <b>-v </b>was given) and
                   off.

     <i>command</i> [<i>flags</i>]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
                   <b>tmux</b>, as described in the following sections.  If no com‐
                   mands are specified, the <b>new-session </b>command is assumed.

     <b>tmux </b>may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combina‐
     tion of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command
     key.

</pre>
<h2><a id="COMMANDS" href="#COMMANDS"></a>COMMANDS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.  Most
     commands accept the optional <b>-t </b>(and sometimes <b>-s</b>) argument with one of
     <i>target-client</i>, <i>target-session target-window</i>, or <i>target-pane</i>.  These
     specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should
     affect.

     <i>target-client</i> should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4)
     file to which the client is connected, for example either of <i>/dev/ttyp1</i>
     or <i>ttyp1</i> for the client attached to <i>/dev/ttyp1</i>.  If no client is speci‐
     fied, <b>tmux </b>attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that
     fails, an error is reported.  Clients may be listed with the
     <b>list-clients </b>command.

     <i>target-session</i> is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the <b>list-sessions</b>
                command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would
                match a session named ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session
                name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is
     accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not
     ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multi‐
     ple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current
     session is used if available; if no current session is available, the
     most recently used is chosen.

     <i>target-window</i> (or <i>src-window</i> or <i>dst-window</i>) specifies a window in the
     form <i>session</i>:<i>window</i>.  <i>session</i> follows the same rules as for
     <i>target-session</i>, and <i>window</i> is looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in
                session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty win‐
     dow name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example
     the <b>new-window </b>and <b>link-window </b>commands) otherwise the current window
     in <i>session</i> is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular win‐
     dows.  Each has a single-character alternative form.

     <b>Token              Meaning</b>
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     <i>target-pane</i> (or <i>src-pane</i> or <i>dst-pane</i>) may be a pane ID or takes a simi‐
     lar form to <i>target-window</i> but with the optional addition of a period
     followed by a pane index or pane ID, for example:
     ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently
     active pane in the specified window is used.  The following special
     tokens are available for the pane index:

     <b>Token                  Meaning</b>
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, <i>target-session</i>, <i>target-window</i> or <i>target-pane</i> may consist
     entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the
     most recent mouse event (see the <i>MOUSE SUPPORT</i> section) or ‘{marked}’
     (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see <b>select-pane -m</b>).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session
     IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.
     These are unique and are unchanged for the life of the session, window
     or pane in the <b>tmux </b>server.  The pane ID is passed to the child process
     of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs may be dis‐
     played using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see
     the <i>FORMATS</i> section) and the <b>display-message</b>, <b>list-sessions</b>,
     <b>list-windows </b>or <b>list-panes </b>commands.

     <i>shell-command</i> arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argu‐
     ment passed to the shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the <b>new-window</b>, <b>new-session</b>, <b>split-window</b>, <b>respawn-window</b>
     and <b>respawn-pane </b>commands allow <i>shell-command</i> to be given as multiple
     arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid
     issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     <i>command</i> [<i>arguments</i>] refers to a <b>tmux </b>command, passed with the command
     and arguments separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Or if using sh(1):

           $ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a <i>command</i>
     <i>sequence</i>.  Each command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon;
     commands are executed sequentially from left to right and lines ending
     with a backslash continue on to the next line, except when escaped by
     another backslash.  A literal semicolon may be included by escaping it
     with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to
     <b>bind-key</b>).

     Example <b>tmux </b>commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

     The <b>tmux </b>server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients
     are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are
     created with the <b>new-session </b>command, or later with the <b>attach-session</b>
     command.  Each session has one or more windows <i>linked</i> into it.  Windows
     may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more
     panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creat‐
     ing, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the
     <i>WINDOWS AND PANES</i> section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     <b>attach-session </b>[<b>-dEr</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>working-directory</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>attach</b>)
             If run from outside <b>tmux</b>, create a new client in the current
             terminal and attach it to <i>target-session</i>.  If used from inside,
             switch the current client.  If <b>-d </b>is specified, any other
             clients attached to the session are detached.  <b>-r </b>signifies the
             client is read-only (only keys bound to the <b>detach-client </b>or
             <b>switch-client </b>commands have any effect)

             If no server is started, <b>attach-session </b>will attempt to start
             it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the configu‐
             ration file.

             The <i>target-session</i> rules for <b>attach-session </b>are slightly
             adjusted: if <b>tmux </b>needs to select the most recently used ses‐
             sion, it will prefer the most recently used <i>unattached</i> session.

             <b>-c </b>will set the session working directory (used for new win‐
             dows) to <i>working-directory</i>.

             If <b>-E </b>is used, the <b>update-environment </b>option will not be
             applied.

     <b>detach-client </b>[<b>-aP</b>] [<b>-E </b><i>shell-command</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>target-session</i>] [<b>-t</b>
             <i>target-client</i>]
                   (alias: <b>detach</b>)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client speci‐
             fied with <b>-t</b>, or all clients currently attached to the session
             specified by <b>-s</b>.  The <b>-a </b>option kills all but the client given
             with <b>-t</b>.  If <b>-P </b>is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of
             the client, typically causing it to exit.  With <b>-E</b>, run
             <i>shell-command</i> to replace the client.

     <b>has-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>has</b>)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does
             not exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

     <b>kill-server</b>
             Kill the <b>tmux </b>server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     <b>kill-session </b>[<b>-aC</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and
             no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.
             If <b>-a </b>is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.
             The <b>-C </b>flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all
             windows linked to the session.

     <b>list-clients </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lsc</b>)
             List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of
             the <b>-F </b>flag, see the <i>FORMATS</i> section.  If <i>target-session</i> is
             specified, list only clients connected to that session.

     <b>list-commands </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lscm</b>)
             List the syntax of all commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.

     <b>list-sessions </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>]
                   (alias: <b>ls</b>)
             List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of
             the <b>-F </b>flag, see the <i>FORMATS</i> section.

     <b>lock-client </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lockc</b>)
             Lock <i>target-client</i>, see the <b>lock-server </b>command.

     <b>lock-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>locks</b>)
             Lock all clients attached to <i>target-session</i>.

     <b>new-session </b>[<b>-AdDEP</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>]
             [<b>-s </b><i>session-name</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>group-name</i>] [<b>-x </b><i>width</i>] [<b>-y </b><i>height</i>]
             [<i>shell-command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>new</b>)
             Create a new session with name <i>session-name</i>.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless <b>-d</b>
             is given.  <i>window-name</i> and <i>shell-command</i> are the name of and
             shell command to execute in the initial window.  With <b>-d</b>, the
             initial size is 80 x 24; <b>-x </b>and <b>-y </b>can be used to specify a
             different size.

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are
             saved and used for new windows in the new session.

             The <b>-A </b>flag makes <b>new-session </b>behave like <b>attach-session </b>if
             <i>session-name</i> already exists; in this case, <b>-D </b>behaves like <b>-d</b>
             to <b>attach-session</b>.

             If <b>-t </b>is given, it specifies a <b>session group</b>.  Sessions in the
             same group share the same set of windows - new windows are
             linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed
             removed from all sessions.  The current and previous window and
             any session options remain independent and any session in a
             group may be killed without affecting the others.  The
             <i>group-name</i> argument may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new
                     session is added to that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is
                     added to the same group as that session, creating a new
                     group if necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new ses‐
                     sion.

             <b>-n </b>and <i>shell-command</i> are invalid if <b>-t </b>is used.

             The <b>-P </b>option prints information about the new session after it
             has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with
             <b>-F</b>.

             If <b>-E </b>is used, the <b>update-environment </b>option will not be
             applied.

     <b>refresh-client </b>[<b>-C </b><i>width,height</i>] [<b>-S</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                   (alias: <b>refresh</b>)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single
             client if one is given with <b>-t</b>.  If <b>-S </b>is specified, only
             update the client's status line.

             <b>-C </b>sets the width and height of a control client.

     <b>rename-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] <i>new-name</i>
                   (alias: <b>rename</b>)
             Rename the session to <i>new-name</i>.

     <b>show-messages </b>[<b>-JT</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                   (alias: <b>showmsgs</b>)
             Show client messages or server information.  Any messages dis‐
             played on the status line are saved in a per-client message
             log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the <i>message-limit</i>
             server option.  With <b>-t</b>, display the log for <i>target-client</i>.  <b>-J</b>
             and <b>-T </b>show debugging information about jobs and terminals.

     <b>source-file </b>[<b>-q</b>] <i>path</i>
                   (alias: <b>source</b>)
             Execute commands from <i>path</i> (which may be a glob(3) pattern).
             If <b>-q </b>is given, no error will be returned if <i>path</i> does not
             exist.

             Within a configuration file, commands may be made conditional
             by surrounding them with <i>%if</i> and <i>%endif</i> lines.  The argument to
             <i>%if</i> is expanded as a format and if it evaluates to false (zero
             or empty), subsequent lines are ignored until <i>%endif</i>.  For
             example:

                   %if #{==:#{host},myhost}
                   set -g status-style bg=red
                   %endif

             Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’.  <i>%if</i>
             may not be nested.

     <b>start-server</b>
                   (alias: <b>start</b>)
             Start the <b>tmux </b>server, if not already running, without creating
             any sessions.

     <b>suspend-client </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                   (alias: <b>suspendc</b>)
             Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

     <b>switch-client </b>[<b>-Elnpr</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] [<b>-T</b>
             <i>key-table</i>]
                   (alias: <b>switchc</b>)
             Switch the current session for client <i>target-client</i> to
             <i>target-session</i>.  If <b>-l</b>, <b>-n </b>or <b>-p </b>is used, the client is moved
             to the last, next or previous session respectively.  <b>-r </b>toggles
             whether a client is read-only (see the <b>attach-session </b>command).

             If <b>-E </b>is used, <b>update-environment </b>option will not be applied.

             <b>-T </b>sets the client's key table; the next key from the client
             will be interpreted from <i>key-table</i>.  This may be used to con‐
             figure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences
             of keys.  For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the <b>list-keys</b>
             command:

                   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                   bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                   bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

     A <b>tmux </b>window may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct
     access to the terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy mode,
     which permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to a
     <i>paste buffer</i> for later insertion into another window.  This mode is
     entered with the <b>copy-mode </b>command, bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is
     also entered when a command that produces output, such as <b>list-keys</b>, is
     executed from a key binding.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the <b>-X </b>flag to the <b>send-keys </b>com‐
     mand.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two
     key tables, depending on the <b>mode-keys </b>option: <b>copy-mode </b>for emacs, or
     <b>copy-mode-vi </b>for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the <b>list-keys </b>com‐
     mand.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

           <b>Command                              vi              emacs</b>

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’
     characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by
     setting the <i>word-separators</i> session option.  Next word moves to the
     start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and
     previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three next and
     previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word
     separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance,
     typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ charac‐
     ter on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.
     With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with
     emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the <b>copy-mode </b>command is:

     <b>copy-mode </b>[<b>-Meu</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
             Enter copy mode.  The <b>-u </b>option scrolls one page up.  <b>-M </b>begins
             a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
             <i>MOUSE SUPPORT</i>).  <b>-e </b>specifies that scrolling to the bottom of
             the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.
             While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for
             scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to
             allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example
             with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by <b>tmux </b>may be split into one or more <i>panes</i>; each
     pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.
     A window may be split into panes using the <b>split-window </b>command.  Win‐
     dows may be split horizontally (with the <b>-h </b>flag) or vertically.  Panes
     may be resized with the <b>resize-pane </b>command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’
     ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed
     with the <b>select-pane </b>command and the <b>rotate-window </b>and <b>swap-pane </b>com‐
     mands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes
     are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset <i>layouts</i> are available.  These may be selected with
     the <b>select-layout </b>command or cycled with <b>next-layout </b>(bound to ‘Space’
     by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and
     resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     <b>even-horizontal</b>
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the win‐
             dow.

     <b>even-vertical</b>
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     <b>main-horizontal</b>
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the
             remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
             space at the bottom.  Use the <i>main-pane-height</i> window option to
             specify the height of the top pane.

     <b>main-vertical</b>
             Similar to <b>main-horizontal </b>but the large pane is placed on the
             left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.
             See the <i>main-pane-width</i> window option.

     <b>tiled   </b>Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in
             both rows and columns.

     In addition, <b>select-layout </b>may be used to apply a previously used lay‐
     out - the <b>list-windows </b>command displays the layout of each window in a
     form suitable for use with <b>select-layout</b>.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     <b>tmux </b>automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current win‐
     dow size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more
     panes than that from which the layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     <b>break-pane </b>[<b>-dP</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t</b>
             <i>dst-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>breakp</b>)
             Break <i>src-pane</i> off from its containing window to make it the
             only pane in <i>dst-window</i>.  If <b>-d </b>is given, the new window does
             not become the current window.  The <b>-P </b>option prints informa‐
             tion about the new window after it has been created.  By
             default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’
             but a different format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

     <b>capture-pane </b>[<b>-aepPqCJ</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-E </b><i>end-line</i>] [<b>-S </b><i>start-line</i>]
             [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>capturep</b>)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If <b>-p </b>is given, the output
             goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with <b>-b </b>or a
             new buffer if omitted.  If <b>-a </b>is given, the alternate screen is
             used, and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate
             screen exists, an error will be returned unless <b>-q </b>is given.
             If <b>-e </b>is given, the output includes escape sequences for text
             and background attributes.  <b>-C </b>also escapes non-printable char‐
             acters as octal \xxx.  <b>-J </b>joins wrapped lines and preserves
             trailing spaces at each line's end.  <b>-P </b>captures only any out‐
             put that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-
             yet incomplete escape sequence.

             <b>-S </b>and <b>-E </b>specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is
             the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are
             lines in the history.  ‘-’ to <b>-S </b>is the start of the history
             and to <b>-E </b>the end of the visible pane.  The default is to cap‐
             ture only the visible contents of the pane.

     <b>choose-client </b>[<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>template</i>]
             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected
             interactively from a list.  The following keys may be used in
             client mode:

                   <b>Key    Function</b>
                   Enter  Choose selected client
                   Up     Select previous client
                   Down   Select next client
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if client is tagged
                   T      Tag no clients
                   C-t    Tag all clients
                   d      Detach selected client
                   D      Detach tagged clients
                   x      Detach and HUP selected client
                   X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                   z      Suspend selected client
                   Z      Suspend tagged clients
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   q      Exit mode

             After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name
             in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a command.  If <i>template</i>
             is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

             <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘name’, ‘size’,
             ‘creation’, or ‘activity’.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter.
             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     <b>choose-tree </b>[<b>-sw</b>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
             [<i>template</i>]
             Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may
             be chosen interactively from a list.  <b>-s </b>starts with sessions
             collapsed and <b>-w </b>with windows collapsed.  The following keys
             may be used in tree mode:

                   <b>Key    Function</b>
                   Enter  Choose selected item
                   Up     Select previous item
                   Down   Select next item
                   &lt;      Scroll list of previews left
                   &gt;      Scroll list of previews right
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if item is tagged
                   T      Tag no items
                   C-t    Tag all items
                   :      Run a command for each tagged item
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   q      Exit mode

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by
             the target in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a command.
             If <i>template</i> is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or
             ‘time’.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter.  This command works
             only if at least one client is attached.

     <b>display-panes </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>] [<i>template</i>]
                   (alias: <b>displayp</b>)
             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by
             <i>target-client</i>.  See the <b>display-panes-time</b>,
             <b>display-panes-colour</b>, and <b>display-panes-active-colour </b>session
             options.  While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be cho‐
             sen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause <i>template</i> to be
             executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.
             The default <i>template</i> is "select-pane -t '%%'".

     <b>find-window </b>[<b>-CNT</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>match-string</i>
                   (alias: <b>findw</b>)
             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern <i>match-string</i> in window names,
             titles, and visible content (but not history).  The flags con‐
             trol matching behavior: <b>-C </b>matches only visible window con‐
             tents, <b>-N </b>matches only the window name and <b>-T </b>matches only the
             window title.  The default is <b>-CNT</b>.

             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     <b>join-pane </b>[<b>-bdhv</b>] [<b>-l </b><i>size</i> | <b>-p </b><i>percentage</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>joinp</b>)
             Like <b>split-window</b>, but instead of splitting <i>dst-pane</i> and creat‐
             ing a new pane, split it and move <i>src-pane</i> into the space.
             This can be used to reverse <b>break-pane</b>.  The <b>-b </b>option causes
             <i>src-pane</i> to be joined to left of or above <i>dst-pane</i>.

             If <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b>
             <b>-m</b>), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     <b>kill-pane </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>killp</b>)
             Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing
             window, it is also destroyed.  The <b>-a </b>option kills all but the
             pane given with <b>-t</b>.

     <b>kill-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>killw</b>)
             Kill the current window or the window at <i>target-window</i>, remov‐
             ing it from any sessions to which it is linked.  The <b>-a </b>option
             kills all but the window given with <b>-t</b>.

     <b>last-pane </b>[<b>-de</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lastp</b>)
             Select the last (previously selected) pane.  <b>-e </b>enables or <b>-d</b>
             disables input to the pane.

     <b>last-window </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>last</b>)
             Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no
             <i>target-session</i> is specified, select the last window of the cur‐
             rent session.

     <b>link-window </b>[<b>-adk</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>linkw</b>)
             Link the window at <i>src-window</i> to the specified <i>dst-window</i>.  If
             <i>dst-window</i> is specified and no such window exists, the
             <i>src-window</i> is linked there.  With <b>-a</b>, the window is moved to
             the next index up (following windows are moved if necessary).
             If <b>-k </b>is given and <i>dst-window</i> exists, it is killed, otherwise
             an error is generated.  If <b>-d </b>is given, the newly linked window
             is not selected.

     <b>list-panes </b>[<b>-as</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lsp</b>)
             If <b>-a </b>is given, <i>target</i> is ignored and all panes on the server
             are listed.  If <b>-s </b>is given, <i>target</i> is a session (or the cur‐
             rent session).  If neither is given, <i>target</i> is a window (or the
             current window).  For the meaning of the <b>-F </b>flag, see the
             <i>FORMATS</i> section.

     <b>list-windows </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lsw</b>)
             If <b>-a </b>is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise,
             list windows in the current session or in <i>target-session</i>.  For
             the meaning of the <b>-F </b>flag, see the <i>FORMATS</i> section.

     <b>move-pane </b>[<b>-bdhv</b>] [<b>-l </b><i>size</i> | <b>-p </b><i>percentage</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>movep</b>)
             Like <b>join-pane</b>, but <i>src-pane</i> and <i>dst-pane</i> may belong to the
             same window.

     <b>move-window </b>[<b>-ardk</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>movew</b>)
             This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the window at <i>src-window</i>
             is moved to <i>dst-window</i>.  With <b>-r</b>, all windows in the session
             are renumbered in sequential order, respecting the <b>base-index</b>
             option.

     <b>new-window </b>[<b>-adkP</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>]
             [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>neww</b>)
             Create a new window.  With <b>-a</b>, the new window is inserted at
             the next index up from the specified <i>target-window</i>, moving win‐
             dows up if necessary, otherwise <i>target-window</i> is the new window
             location.

             If <b>-d </b>is given, the session does not make the new window the
             current window.  <i>target-window</i> represents the window to be cre‐
             ated; if the target already exists an error is shown, unless
             the <b>-k </b>flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.
             <i>shell-command</i> is the command to execute.  If <i>shell-command</i> is
             not specified, the value of the <b>default-command </b>option is used.
             <b>-c </b>specifies the working directory in which the new window is
             created.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the
             <b>remain-on-exit </b>option to change this behaviour.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’
             for all programs running <i>inside</i> <b>tmux</b>.  New windows will auto‐
             matically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but
             care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

             The <b>-P </b>option prints information about the new window after it
             has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be
             specified with <b>-F</b>.

     <b>next-layout </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>nextl</b>)
             Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to
             fit.

     <b>next-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>next</b>)
             Move to the next window in the session.  If <b>-a </b>is used, move to
             the next window with an alert.

     <b>pipe-pane </b>[<b>-o</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>pipep</b>)
             Pipe any output sent by the program in <i>target-pane</i> to a shell
             command.  A pane may only be piped to one command at a time,
             any existing pipe is closed before <i>shell-command</i> is executed.
             The <i>shell-command</i> string may contain the special character
             sequences supported by the <b>status-left </b>option.  If no
             <i>shell-command</i> is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

             The <b>-o </b>option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists,
             allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

                   bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P'

     <b>previous-layout </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>prevl</b>)
             Move to the previous layout in the session.

     <b>previous-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                   (alias: <b>prev</b>)
             Move to the previous window in the session.  With <b>-a</b>, move to
             the previous window with an alert.

     <b>rename-window </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] <i>new-name</i>
                   (alias: <b>renamew</b>)
             Rename the current window, or the window at <i>target-window</i> if
             specified, to <i>new-name</i>.

     <b>resize-pane </b>[<b>-DLMRUZ</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<b>-x </b><i>width</i>] [<b>-y </b><i>height</i>]
             [<i>adjustment</i>]
                   (alias: <b>resizep</b>)
             Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by <i>adjustment</i> with <b>-U</b>,
             <b>-D</b>, <b>-L </b>or <b>-R</b>, or to an absolute size with <b>-x </b>or <b>-y</b>.  The
             <i>adjustment</i> is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).

             With <b>-Z</b>, the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying
             the whole of the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in
             the layout).

             <b>-M </b>begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key
             binding, see <i>MOUSE SUPPORT</i>).

     <b>respawn-pane </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>respawnp</b>)
             Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the
             <b>remain-on-exit </b>window option).  If <i>shell-command</i> is not given,
             the command used when the pane was created is executed.  The
             pane must be already inactive, unless <b>-k </b>is given, in which
             case any existing command is killed.

     <b>respawn-window </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>respawnw</b>)
             Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the
             <b>remain-on-exit </b>window option).  If <i>shell-command</i> is not given,
             the command used when the window was created is executed.  The
             window must be already inactive, unless <b>-k </b>is given, in which
             case any existing command is killed.

     <b>rotate-window </b>[<b>-DU</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>rotatew</b>)
             Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either
             upward (numerically lower) with <b>-U </b>or downward (numerically
             higher).

     <b>select-layout </b>[<b>-nop</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] [<i>layout-name</i>]
                   (alias: <b>selectl</b>)
             Choose a specific layout for a window.  If <i>layout-name</i> is not
             given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.  <b>-n</b>
             and <b>-p </b>are equivalent to the <b>next-layout </b>and <b>previous-layout</b>
             commands.  <b>-o </b>applies the last set layout if possible (undoes
             the most recent layout change).

     <b>select-pane </b>[<b>-DdegLlMmRU</b>] [<b>-P </b><i>style</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>selectp</b>)
             Make pane <i>target-pane</i> the active pane in window <i>target-window</i>,
             or set its style (with <b>-P</b>).  If one of <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, or <b>-U </b>is
             used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right,
             or above the target pane is used.  <b>-l </b>is the same as using the
             <b>last-pane </b>command.  <b>-e </b>enables or <b>-d </b>disables input to the
             pane.

             <b>-m </b>and <b>-M </b>are used to set and clear the <i>marked pane</i>.  There is
             one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the
             last.  The marked pane is the default target for <b>-s </b>to
             <b>join-pane</b>, <b>swap-pane </b>and <b>swap-window</b>.

             Each pane has a style: by default the <b>window-style </b>and
             <b>window-active-style </b>options are used, <b>select-pane -P </b>sets the
             style for a single pane.  For example, to set the pane 1 back‐
             ground to red:

                   select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'

             <b>-g </b>shows the current pane style.

     <b>select-window </b>[<b>-lnpT</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>selectw</b>)
             Select the window at <i>target-window</i>.  <b>-l</b>, <b>-n </b>and <b>-p </b>are equiva‐
             lent to the <b>last-window</b>, <b>next-window </b>and <b>previous-window </b>com‐
             mands.  If <b>-T </b>is given and the selected window is already the
             current window, the command behaves like <b>last-window</b>.

     <b>split-window </b>[<b>-bdfhvP</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>size</i> | <b>-p </b><i>percentage</i>]
             [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>]
                   (alias: <b>splitw</b>)
             Create a new pane by splitting <i>target-pane</i>: <b>-h </b>does a horizon‐
             tal split and <b>-v </b>a vertical split; if neither is specified, <b>-v</b>
             is assumed.  The <b>-l </b>and <b>-p </b>options specify the size of the new
             pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal
             split), or as a percentage, respectively.  The <b>-b </b>option causes
             the new pane to be created to the left of or above <i>target-pane</i>.
             The <b>-f </b>option creates a new pane spanning the full window
             height (with <b>-h</b>) or full window width (with <b>-v</b>), instead of
             splitting the active pane.  All other options have the same
             meaning as for the <b>new-window </b>command.

     <b>swap-pane </b>[<b>-dDU</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>swapp</b>)
             Swap two panes.  If <b>-U </b>is used and no source pane is specified
             with <b>-s</b>, <i>dst-pane</i> is swapped with the previous pane (before it
             numerically); <b>-D </b>swaps with the next pane (after it numeri‐
             cally).  <b>-d </b>instructs <b>tmux </b>not to change the active pane.

             If <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present (see <b>select-pane</b>
             <b>-m</b>), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     <b>swap-window </b>[<b>-d</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>swapw</b>)
             This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the source and destina‐
             tion windows are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists
             at <i>src-window</i>.

             Like <b>swap-pane</b>, if <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present
             (see <b>select-pane -m</b>), the window containing the marked pane is
             used rather than the current window.

     <b>unlink-window </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                   (alias: <b>unlinkw</b>)
             Unlink <i>target-window</i>.  Unless <b>-k </b>is given, a window may be
             unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows
             may not be linked to no sessions; if <b>-k </b>is specified and the
             window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and
             destroyed.

<h2><a id="KEY_BINDINGS" href="#KEY_BINDINGS"></a>KEY BINDINGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a pre‐
     fix key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example
     ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt
     (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are
     accepted: <i>Up</i>, <i>Down</i>, <i>Left</i>, <i>Right</i>, <i>BSpace</i>, <i>BTab</i>, <i>DC</i> (Delete), <i>End</i>, <i>Enter</i>,
     <i>Escape</i>, <i>F1</i> to <i>F12</i>, <i>Home</i>, <i>IC</i> (Insert), <i>NPage/PageDown/PgDn</i>,
     <i>PPage/PageUp/PgUp</i>, <i>Space</i>, and <i>Tab</i>.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’
     keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     <b>bind-key </b>[<b>-nr</b>] [<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>] <i>key command</i> [<i>arguments</i>]
                   (alias: <b>bind</b>)
             Bind key <i>key</i> to <i>command</i>.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By
             default (without -T), the key is bound in the <i>prefix</i> key table.
             This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for
             example, by default ‘c’ is bound to <b>new-window </b>in the <i>prefix</i>
             table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The <i>root</i> table is
             used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
             <b>new-window </b>in the <i>root</i> table (not recommended) means a plain
             ‘c’ will create a new window.  <b>-n </b>is an alias for <b>-T </b><i>root</i>.
             Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the
             <b>switch-client -T </b>command used to switch to them from a key
             binding.  The <b>-r </b>flag indicates this key may repeat, see the
             <b>repeat-time </b>option.

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the
             <b>list-keys </b>command.

     <b>list-keys </b>[<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lsk</b>)
             List all key bindings.  Without <b>-T </b>all key tables are printed.
             With <b>-T </b>only <i>key-table</i>.

     <b>send-keys </b>[<b>-lMRX</b>] [<b>-N </b><i>repeat-count</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>key ...</i>
                   (alias: <b>send</b>)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument <i>key</i> is the name
             of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is
             not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of characters.
             The <b>-l </b>flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys liter‐
             ally.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.
             The <b>-R </b>flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

             <b>-M </b>passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse
             key binding, see <i>MOUSE SUPPORT</i>).

             <b>-X </b>is used to send a command into copy mode - see the <i>WINDOWS</i>
             <i>AND PANES</i> section.  <b>-N </b>specifies a repeat count.

     <b>send-prefix </b>[<b>-2</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
             Send the prefix key, or with <b>-2 </b>the secondary prefix key, to a
             window as if it was pressed.

     <b>unbind-key </b>[<b>-an</b>] [<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>] <i>key</i>
                   (alias: <b>unbind</b>)
             Unbind the command bound to <i>key</i>.  <b>-n </b>and <b>-T </b>are the same as for
             <b>bind-key</b>.  If <b>-a </b>is present, all key bindings are removed.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     The appearance and behaviour of <b>tmux </b>may be modified by changing the
     value of various options.  There are three types of option: <i>server</i>
     <i>options</i>, <i>session options</i> and <i>window options</i>.

     The <b>tmux </b>server has a set of global options which do not apply to any
     particular window or session.  These are altered with the <b>set-option -s</b>
     command, or displayed with the <b>show-options -s </b>command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options,
     and there is a separate set of global session options.  Sessions which
     do not have a particular option configured inherit the value from the
     global session options.  Session options are set or unset with the
     <b>set-option </b>command and may be listed with the <b>show-options </b>command.
     The available server and session options are listed under the
     <b>set-option </b>command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and
     there is a set of global window options from which any unset options
     are inherited.  Window options are altered with the <b>set-window-option</b>
     command and can be listed with the <b>show-window-options </b>command.  All
     window options are documented with the <b>set-window-option </b>command.

     <b>tmux </b>also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User
     options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and
     be set to any string.  For example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     <b>set-option </b>[<b>-aFgoqsuw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i> | <i>target-window</i>] <i>option value</i>
                   (alias: <b>set</b>)
             Set a window option with <b>-w </b>(equivalent to the
             <b>set-window-option </b>command), a server option with <b>-s</b>, otherwise
             a session option.  If <b>-g </b>is given, the global session or window
             option is set.  <b>-F </b>expands formats in the option value.  The <b>-u</b>
             flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from
             the global options (or with <b>-g</b>, restores a global option to the
             default).

             The <b>-o </b>flag prevents setting an option that is already set and
             the <b>-q </b>flag suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous
             options.

             With <b>-a</b>, and if the option expects a string or a style, <i>value</i>
             is appended to the existing setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background <i>and</i> blue foreground.  Without
             <b>-a</b>, the result would be the default background and a blue fore‐
             ground.

             Available window options are listed under <b>set-window-option</b>.

             <i>value</i> depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a
             flag (on, off, or omitted to toggle).

             Available server options are:

             <b>buffer-limit </b><i>number</i>
                     Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to
                     the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the
                     bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

             <b>command-alias[] </b><i>name=value</i>
                     This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an
                     unknown command matches <i>name</i>, it is replaced with
                     <i>value</i>.  For example, after:

                           set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'

                     Using:

                           zoom -t:.1

                     Is equivalent to:

                           resize-pane -Z -t:.1

                     Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed
                     rather than when it is executed, so binding an alias
                     with <b>bind-key </b>will bind the expanded form.

             <b>default-terminal </b><i>terminal</i>
                     Set the default terminal for new windows created in
                     this session - the default value of the TERM environ‐
                     ment variable.  For <b>tmux </b>to work correctly, this <i>must</i>
                     be set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative of them.

             <b>escape-time </b><i>time</i>
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which <b>tmux </b>waits after
                     an escape is input to determine if it is part of a
                     function or meta key sequences.  The default is 500
                     milliseconds.

             <b>exit-unattached </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If enabled, the server will exit when there are no
                     attached clients.

             <b>focus-events </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     When enabled, focus events are requested from the ter‐
                     minal if supported and passed through to applications
                     running in <b>tmux</b>.  Attached clients should be detached
                     and attached again after changing this option.

             <b>history-file </b><i>path</i>
                     If not empty, a file to which <b>tmux </b>will write command
                     prompt history on exit and load it from on start.

             <b>message-limit </b><i>number</i>
                     Set the number of error or information messages to save
                     in the message log for each client.  The default is

             <b>set-clipboard </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>external </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
                     xterm(1) escape sequence, if there is an <i>Ms</i> entry in
                     the terminfo(5) description (see the <i>TERMINFO</i>
                     <i>EXTENSIONS</i> section).

                     If set to <b>on</b>, <b>tmux </b>will both accept the escape sequence
                     to create a buffer and attempt to set the terminal
                     clipboard.  If set to <b>external</b>, <b>tmux </b>will attempt to
                     set the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts by
                     applications to set <b>tmux </b>buffers.  If <b>off</b>, <b>tmux </b>will
                     neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor
                     attempt to set the clipboard.

                     Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1)
                     by setting the resource:

                           disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                     Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive
                     menu when required.

             <b>terminal-overrides[] </b><i>string</i>
                     Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to
                     be overridden.  Each entry is a colon-separated string
                     made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using
                     fnmatch(3)) and a set of <i>name=value</i> entries.

                     For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to
                     ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types matching ‘rxvt*’:

                           rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3)
                     before interpretation.

             Available session options are:

             <b>assume-paste-time </b><i>milliseconds</i>
                     If keys are entered faster than one in <i>milliseconds</i>,
                     they are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed
                     and <b>tmux </b>key bindings are not processed.  The default
                     is one millisecond and zero disables.

             <b>base-index </b><i>index</i>
                     Set the base index from which an unused index should be
                     searched when a new window is created.  The default is
                     zero.

             <b>bell-action </b>[<b>any </b>| <b>none </b>| <b>current </b>| <b>other</b>]
                     Set action on window bell.  <b>any </b>means a bell in any
                     window linked to a session causes a bell in the current
                     window of that session, <b>none </b>means all bells are
                     ignored, <b>current </b>means only bells in windows other than
                     the current window are ignored and <b>other </b>means bells in
                     the current window are ignored but not those in other
                     windows.

             <b>bell-on-alert </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If on, ring the terminal bell when an alert occurs.

             <b>default-command </b><i>shell-command</i>
                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified
                     when the window is created) to <i>shell-command</i>, which may
                     be any sh(1) command.  The default is an empty string,
                     which instructs <b>tmux </b>to create a login shell using the
                     value of the <b>default-shell </b>option.

             <b>default-shell </b><i>path</i>
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login
                     shell for new windows when the <b>default-command </b>option
                     is set to empty, and must be the full path of the exe‐
                     cutable.  When started <b>tmux </b>tries to set a default
                     value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment
                     variable, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or
                     <i>/bin/sh</i>.  This option should be configured when <b>tmux </b>is
                     used as a login shell.

             <b>destroy-unattached </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any
                     clients, it is destroyed.

             <b>detach-on-destroy </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If on (the default), the client is detached when the
                     session it is attached to is destroyed.  If off, the
                     client is switched to the most recently active of the
                     remaining sessions.

             <b>display-panes-active-colour </b><i>colour</i>
                     Set the colour used by the <b>display-panes </b>command to
                     show the indicator for the active pane.

             <b>display-panes-colour </b><i>colour</i>
                     Set the colour used by the <b>display-panes </b>command to
                     show the indicators for inactive panes.

             <b>display-panes-time </b><i>time</i>
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators
                     shown by the <b>display-panes </b>command appear.

             <b>display-time </b><i>time</i>
                     Set the amount of time for which status line messages
                     and other on-screen indicators are displayed.  If set
                     to 0, messages and indicators are displayed until a key
                     is pressed.  <i>time</i> is in milliseconds.

             <b>history-limit </b><i>lines</i>
                     Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.
                     This setting applies only to new windows - existing
                     window histories are not resized and retain the limit
                     at the point they were created.

             <b>key-table </b><i>key-table</i>
                     Set the default key table to <i>key-table</i> instead of <i>root</i>.

             <b>lock-after-time </b><i>number</i>
                     Lock the session (like the <b>lock-session </b>command) after
                     <i>number</i> seconds of inactivity.  The default is not to
                     lock (set to 0).

             <b>lock-command </b><i>shell-command</i>
                     Command to run when locking each client.  The default
                     is to run lock(1) with <b>-np</b>.

             <b>message-command-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line message command style, where <i>style</i> is a
                     comma-separated list of characteristics to be speci‐
                     fied.

                     These may be ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour,
                     ‘fg=colour’ to set the foreground colour, and a list of
                     attributes as specified below.

                     The colour is one of: <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>,
                     <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>white</b>, aixterm bright variants (if sup‐
                     ported: <b>brightred</b>, <b>brightgreen</b>, and so on), <b>colour0 </b>to
                     <b>colour255 </b>from the 256-colour set, <b>default</b>, or a hexa‐
                     decimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’, which chooses the
                     closest match from the default 256-colour set.

                     The attributes is either <b>none </b>or a comma-delimited list
                     of one or more of: <b>bright </b>(or <b>bold</b>), <b>dim</b>, <b>underscore</b>,
                     <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>hidden</b>, <b>italics</b>, or <b>strikethrough </b>to
                     turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with
                     ‘no’ to turn one off.

                     Examples are:

                           fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                     With the <b>-a </b>flag to the <b>set-option </b>command the new
                     style is added otherwise the existing style is
                     replaced.

             <b>message-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line message style.  For how to specify
                     <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>mouse </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If on, <b>tmux </b>captures the mouse and allows mouse events
                     to be bound as key bindings.  See the <i>MOUSE SUPPORT</i>
                     section for details.

             <b>prefix </b><i>key</i>
                     Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to
                     the standard keys described under <i>KEY BINDINGS</i>, <b>prefix</b>
                     can be set to the special key ‘None’ to set no prefix.

             <b>prefix2 </b><i>key</i>
                     Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like
                     <b>prefix</b>, <b>prefix2 </b>can be set to ‘None’.

             <b>renumber-windows </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If on, when a window is closed in a session, automati‐
                     cally renumber the other windows in numerical order.
                     This respects the <b>base-index </b>option if it has been set.
                     If off, do not renumber the windows.

             <b>repeat-time </b><i>time</i>
                     Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing
                     the prefix-key again in the specified <i>time</i> milliseconds
                     (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may be set
                     when it is bound using the <b>-r </b>flag to <b>bind-key</b>.  Repeat
                     is enabled for the default keys bound to the
                     <b>resize-pane </b>command.

             <b>set-titles </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Attempt to set the client terminal title using the <i>tsl</i>
                     and <i>fsl</i> terminfo(5) entries if they exist.  <b>tmux </b>auto‐
                     matically sets these to the \e]0;...\007 sequence if
                     the terminal appears to be xterm(1).  This option is
                     off by default.

             <b>set-titles-string </b><i>string</i>
                     String used to set the window title if <b>set-titles </b>is
                     on.  Formats are expanded, see the <i>FORMATS</i> section.

             <b>status </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Show or hide the status line.

             <b>status-interval </b><i>interval</i>
                     Update the status line every <i>interval</i> seconds.  By
                     default, updates will occur every 15 seconds.  A set‐
                     ting of zero disables redrawing at interval.

             <b>status-justify </b>[<b>left </b>| <b>centre </b>| <b>right</b>]
                     Set the position of the window list component of the
                     status line: left, centre or right justified.

             <b>status-keys </b>[<b>vi </b>| <b>emacs</b>]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line,
                     for example at the command prompt.  The default is
                     emacs, unless the VISUAL or EDITOR environment vari‐
                     ables are set and contain the string ‘vi’.

             <b>status-left </b><i>string</i>
                     Display <i>string</i> (by default the session name) to the
                     left of the status line.  <i>string</i> will be passed through
                     strftime(3) and formats (see <i>FORMATS</i>) will be expanded.
                     It may also contain the special character sequence #[]
                     to change the colour or attributes, for example
                     ‘#[fg=red,bright]’ to set a bright red foreground.  See
                     the <b>message-command-style </b>option for a description of
                     colours and attributes.

                     For details on how the names and titles can be set see
                     the <i>NAMES AND TITLES</i> section.

                     Examples are:

                           #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                           #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

                     The default is ‘[#S] ’.

             <b>status-left-length </b><i>length</i>
                     Set the maximum <i>length</i> of the left component of the
                     status line.  The default is 10.

             <b>status-left-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set the style of the left part of the status line.  For
                     how to specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style</b>
                     option.

             <b>status-position </b>[<b>top </b>| <b>bottom</b>]
                     Set the position of the status line.

             <b>status-right </b><i>string</i>
                     Display <i>string</i> to the right of the status line.  By
                     default, the current window title in double quotes, the
                     date and the time are shown.  As with <b>status-left</b>,
                     <i>string</i> will be passed to strftime(3) and character
                     pairs are replaced.

             <b>status-right-length </b><i>length</i>
                     Set the maximum <i>length</i> of the right component of the
                     status line.  The default is 40.

             <b>status-right-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set the style of the right part of the status line.
                     For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style</b>
                     option.

             <b>status-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see
                     the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>update-environment[] </b><i>variable</i>
                     Set list of environment variables to be copied into the
                     session environment when a new session is created or an
                     existing session is attached.  Any variables that do
                     not exist in the source environment are set to be
                     removed from the session environment (as if <b>-r </b>was
                     given to the <b>set-environment </b>command).

             <b>user-keys[] </b><i>key</i>
                     Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each
                     item is associated with a key named ‘User0’, ‘User1’,
                     and so on.

                     For example:

                           set -s user-keys[0] '\[5;30012~'
                           bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

             <b>visual-activity </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If on, display a status line message when activity
                     occurs in a window for which the <b>monitor-activity </b>win‐
                     dow option is enabled.

             <b>visual-bell </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell
                     instead of it being passed through to the terminal
                     (which normally makes a sound).  Also see the
                     <b>bell-action </b>option.

             <b>visual-silence </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If <b>monitor-silence </b>is enabled, prints a message after
                     the interval has expired on a given window.

             <b>word-separators </b><i>string</i>
                     Sets the session's conception of what characters are
                     considered word separators, for the purposes of the
                     next and previous word commands in copy mode.  The
                     default is ‘ -_@’.

     <b>set-window-option </b>[<b>-aFgoqu</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] <i>option value</i>
                   (alias: <b>setw</b>)
             Set a window option.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-q </b>and <b>-u </b>flags work
             similarly to the <b>set-option </b>command.

             Supported window options are:

             <b>aggressive-resize </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that
                     <b>tmux </b>will resize the window to the size of the smallest
                     session for which it is the current window, rather than
                     the smallest session to which it is attached.  The win‐
                     dow may resize when the current window is changed on
                     another sessions; this option is good for full-screen
                     programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interac‐
                     tive programs such as shells.

             <b>allow-rename </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Allow programs to change the window name using a termi‐
                     nal escape sequence (\ek...\e\\).  The default is on.

             <b>alternate-screen </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     This option configures whether programs running inside
                     <b>tmux </b>may use the terminal alternate screen feature,
                     which allows the <i>smcup</i> and <i>rmcup</i> terminfo(5) capabili‐
                     ties.  The alternate screen feature preserves the con‐
                     tents of the window when an interactive application
                     starts and restores it on exit, so that any output vis‐
                     ible before the application starts reappears unchanged
                     after it exits.  The default is on.

             <b>automatic-rename </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting
                     is enabled, <b>tmux </b>will rename the window automatically
                     using the format specified by <b>automatic-rename-format</b>.
                     This flag is automatically disabled for an individual
                     window when a name is specified at creation with
                     <b>new-window </b>or <b>new-session</b>, or later with <b>rename-window</b>,
                     or with a terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched
                     off globally with:

                           set-window-option -g automatic-rename off

             <b>automatic-rename-format </b><i>format</i>
                     The format (see <i>FORMATS</i>) used when the <b>automatic-rename</b>
                     option is enabled.

             <b>clock-mode-colour </b><i>colour</i>
                     Set clock colour.

             <b>clock-mode-style </b>[<b>12 </b>| <b>24</b>]
                     Set clock hour format.

             <b>force-height </b><i>height</i>
             <b>force-width </b><i>width</i>
                     Prevent <b>tmux </b>from resizing a window to greater than
                     <i>width</i> or <i>height</i>.  A value of zero restores the default
                     unlimited setting.

             <b>main-pane-height </b><i>height</i>
             <b>main-pane-width </b><i>width</i>
                     Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane
                     in the <b>main-horizontal </b>or <b>main-vertical </b>layouts.

             <b>mode-keys </b>[<b>vi </b>| <b>emacs</b>]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy mode.  The
                     default is emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains
                     ‘vi’.

             <b>mode-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set window modes style.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see
                     the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>monitor-activity </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Monitor for activity in the window.  Windows with
                     activity are highlighted in the status line.

             <b>monitor-silence </b>[<b>interval</b>]
                     Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within
                     <b>interval </b>seconds.  Windows that have been silent for
                     the interval are highlighted in the status line.  An
                     interval of zero disables the monitoring.

             <b>other-pane-height </b><i>height</i>
                     Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane)
                     in the <b>main-horizontal </b>layout.  If this option is set
                     to 0 (the default), it will have no effect.  If both
                     the <b>main-pane-height </b>and <b>other-pane-height </b>options are
                     set, the main pane will grow taller to make the other
                     panes the specified height, but will never shrink to do
                     so.

             <b>other-pane-width </b><i>width</i>
                     Like <b>other-pane-height</b>, but set the width of other
                     panes in the <b>main-vertical </b>layout.

             <b>pane-active-border-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set the pane border style for the currently active
                     pane.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the
                     <b>message-command-style </b>option.  Attributes are ignored.

             <b>pane-base-index </b><i>index</i>
                     Like <b>base-index</b>, but set the starting index for pane
                     numbers.

             <b>pane-border-format </b><i>format</i>
                     Set the text shown in pane border status lines.

             <b>pane-border-status </b>[<b>off </b>| <b>top </b>| <b>bottom</b>]
                     Turn pane border status lines off or set their posi‐
                     tion.

             <b>pane-border-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set the pane border style for panes aside from the
                     active pane.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the
                     <b>message-command-style </b>option.  Attributes are ignored.

             <b>remain-on-exit </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the
                     program running in it exits.  The window may be reacti‐
                     vated with the <b>respawn-window </b>command.

             <b>synchronize-panes </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the
                     same window (only for panes that are not in any special
                     mode).

             <b>window-active-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set the style for the window's active pane.  For how to
                     specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>window-status-activity-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style for windows with an activity
                     alert.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the
                     <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>window-status-bell-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.
                     For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style</b>
                     option.

             <b>window-status-current-format </b><i>string</i>
                     Like <i>window-status-format</i>, but is the format used when
                     the window is the current window.

             <b>window-status-current-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style for the currently active window.
                     For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style</b>
                     option.

             <b>window-status-format </b><i>string</i>
                     Set the format in which the window is displayed in the
                     status line window list.  See the <i>status-left</i> option
                     for details of special character sequences available.
                     The default is ‘#I:#W#F’.

             <b>window-status-last-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style for the last active window.  For

                     Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status
                     line.  The default is a single space character.

             <b>window-status-style </b><i>style</i>
                     Set status line style for a single window.  For how to
                     specify <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>window-style </b><i>style</i>

                     <i>style</i>, see the <b>message-command-style </b>option.

             <b>wrap-search </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If this option is set, searches will wrap around the
                     end of the pane contents.  The default is on.

             <b>xterm-keys </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
                     If this option is set, <b>tmux </b>will generate xterm(1)
                     -style function key sequences; these have a number
                     included to indicate modifiers such as Shift, Alt or
                     Ctrl.

     <b>show-options </b>[<b>-gqsvw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i> | <i>target-window</i>] [<i>option</i>]
                   (alias: <b>show</b>)
             Show the window options (or a single window option if given)
             with <b>-w </b>(equivalent to <b>show-window-options</b>), the server options
             with <b>-s</b>, otherwise the session options for <i>target session</i>.
             Global session or window options are listed if <b>-g </b>is used.  <b>-v</b>
             shows only the option value, not the name.  If <b>-q </b>is set, no
             error will be returned if <i>option</i> is unset.

     <b>show-window-options </b>[<b>-gv</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] [<i>option</i>]
                   (alias: <b>showw</b>)

<h2><a id="HOOKS" href="#HOOKS"></a>HOOKS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>allows commands to run on various triggers, called <i>hooks</i>.  Most
     <b>tmux </b>commands have an <i>after</i> hook and there are a number of hooks not
     associated with commands.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the com‐
     mand is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’
     prefix.  For example, the following command adds a hook to select the
     even-vertical layout after every <b>split-window</b>:

           set-hook after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     In addition, the following hooks are available:

     alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See
                             <b>monitor-activity</b>.

     alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.

     alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See
                             <b>monitor-silence</b>.

     client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached         Run when a client is detached

     client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is
                             changed.

     pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits,
                             but <b>remain-on-exit </b>is on so the pane has not
                             closed.

     pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using
                             the xterm(1) escape sequence.

     session-created         Run when a new session created.

     session-closed          Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

     window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

     window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

     <b>set-hook </b>[<b>-gu</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] <i>hook-name command</i>
             Sets (or with <b>-u </b>unsets) hook <i>hook-name</i> to <i>command</i>.  If <b>-g </b>is
             given, <i>hook-name</i> is added to the global list of hooks, other‐
             wise it is added to the session hooks (for <i>target-session</i> with
             <b>-t</b>).  Like options, session hooks inherit from the global ones.

     <b>show-hooks </b>[<b>-g</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
             Shows the global list of hooks with <b>-g</b>, otherwise the session
             hooks.

<h2><a id="MOUSE_SUPPORT" href="#MOUSE_SUPPORT"></a>MOUSE SUPPORT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     If the <b>mouse </b>option is on (the default is off), <b>tmux </b>allows mouse
     events to be bound as keys.  The name of each key is made up of a mouse
     event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix (one of ‘Pane’ for the
     contents of a pane, ‘Border’ for a pane border or ‘Status’ for the sta‐
     tus line).  The following mouse events are available:

           WheelUp       WheelDown
           MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
           DoubleClick1  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3 WheelUp
           TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3 WheelDown

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example
     ‘MouseDown1Status’.

     The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as <i>target-window</i> or
     <i>target-pane</i> in commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to
     the window or pane over which the mouse event took place (for example,
     the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a
     ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled
     for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

     The <b>send-keys -M </b>flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and
     resize panes, to copy text and to change window using the status line.
     These take effect if the <b>mouse </b>option is turned on.
</pre>
<h2><a id="FORMATS" href="#FORMATS"></a>FORMATS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     Certain commands accept the <b>-F </b>flag with a <i>format</i> argument.  This is a
     string which controls the output format of the command.  Replacement
     variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.
     The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a
     <b>tmux </b>option may be used for an option's value.  Some variables have a
     shorter alias such as ‘#S’, and ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two
     alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists and is not
     zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the second is used.
     For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include
     the string ‘attached’ if the session is attached and the string ‘not
     attached’ if it is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will
     include ‘yes’ if <b>automatic-rename </b>is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.

     Comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alterna‐
     tives by ‘==’ or ‘!=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’
     will be replaced by ‘1’ if running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  An
     ‘m’ specifies an fnmatch(3) comparison where the first argument is the
     pattern and the second the string to compare, for example
     ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’.  ‘||’ and ‘&amp;&amp;’ evaluate to true if either or both
     of two comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
     ‘#{||,#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.  A ‘C’ performs a search for
     an fnmatch(3) pattern in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not
     found, or a line number if found.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefix‐
     ing it by an ‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from
     the start of the string and negative from the end, so
     ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 5 characters of the
     pane title, or ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the last 5 characters.  Prefixing a
     time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if
     ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives
     ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3)
     and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.  A prefix of the form
     ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.

     In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted
     using ‘#()’.  For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.
     When constructing formats, <b>tmux </b>does not wait for ‘#()’ commands to
     finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is
     used, or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.  If the
     command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but
     the status line will not be updated more than once a second.  Commands
     are executed with the <b>tmux </b>global environment set (see the <i>ENVIRONMENT</i>
     section).

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

     <b>Variable name          Alias    Replaced with</b>
     alternate_on                    If pane is in alternate screen

<h2><a id="NAMES_AND_TITLES" href="#NAMES_AND_TITLES"></a>NAMES AND TITLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have
     names, which may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed
     in the status line and various lists: the name is the <b>tmux </b>identifier
     for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is
     typically set by the program running inside the pane and is not modi‐
     fied by <b>tmux</b>.  It is the same mechanism used to set for example the
     xterm(1) window title in an X(7) window manager.  Windows themselves do
     not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.
     <b>tmux </b>itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is
     running, see the <b>set-titles </b>option.

     A session's name is set with the <b>new-session </b>and <b>rename-session </b>com‐
     mands.  A window's name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as <b>-n </b>for <b>new-window </b>or <b>new-session</b>).

     2.      An escape sequence:

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command
             in the window's active pane.  See the <b>automatic-rename </b>option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's
     title can be set via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'
</pre>
<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT" href="#ENVIRONMENT"></a>ENVIRONMENT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     When the server is started, <b>tmux </b>copies the environment into the <i>global</i>
     <i>environment</i>; in addition, each session has a <i>session environment</i>.  When
     a window is created, the session and global environments are merged.
     If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is
     used.  The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.

     The <b>update-environment </b>session option may be used to update the session
     environment from the client when a new session is created or an old
     reattached.  <b>tmux </b>also initialises the TMUX variable with some internal
     information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM
     variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     <b>set-environment </b>[<b>-gru</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] <i>name</i> [<i>value</i>]
                   (alias: <b>setenv</b>)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If <b>-g </b>is used, the
             change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is
             applied to the session environment for <i>target-session</i>.  The <b>-u</b>
             flag unsets a variable.  <b>-r </b>indicates the variable is to be
             removed from the environment before starting a new process.

     <b>show-environment </b>[<b>-gs</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] [<i>variable</i>]
                   (alias: <b>showenv</b>)
             Display the environment for <i>target-session</i> or the global envi‐
             ronment with <b>-g</b>.  If <i>variable</i> is omitted, all variables are
             shown.  Variables removed from the environment are prefixed
             with ‘-’.  If <b>-s </b>is used, the output is formatted as a set of
             Bourne shell commands.

<h2><a id="STATUS_LINE" href="#STATUS_LINE"></a>STATUS LINE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom
     line of each terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may
     be disabled with the <b>status </b>session option) and contains, from left-to-
     right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window
     list; the title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and
     date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right
     sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output
     from a shell command, see the <b>status-left</b>, <b>status-left-length</b>,
     <b>status-right</b>, and <b>status-right-length </b>options below), and a central
     window list.  By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if
     any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending
     numerical order.  It may be customised with the <i>window-status-format</i>
     and <i>window-status-current-format</i> options.  The flag is one of the fol‐
     lowing symbols appended to the window name:

           <b>Symbol    Meaning</b>
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         A bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence
                                interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the <b>monitor-activity </b>window option.  The window
     name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or
     silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the
     entire status line using the <b>status-style </b>session option and individual
     windows using the <b>window-status-style </b>window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has
     changed, the interval may be controlled with the <b>status-interval </b>ses‐
     sion option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     <b>command-prompt </b>[<b>-1i</b>] [<b>-I </b><i>inputs</i>] [<b>-p </b><i>prompts</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
             [<i>template</i>]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from
             inside <b>tmux </b>to execute commands interactively.

             If <i>template</i> is specified, it is used as the command.  If
             present, <b>-I </b>is a comma-separated list of the initial text for
             each prompt.  If <b>-p </b>is given, <i>prompts</i> is a comma-separated list
             of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single
             prompt is displayed, constructed from <i>template</i> if it is
             present, or ‘:’ if not.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the
             string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the
             response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’ are replaced with the
             response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.
             Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).
             ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

             <b>-1 </b>makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the
             resulting input is a single character.  <b>-i </b>executes the command
             every time the prompt input changes instead of when the user
             exits the command prompt.

             The following keys have a special meaning in the command
             prompt, depending on the value of the <b>status-keys </b>option:

                   <b>Function                             vi        emacs</b>

                   (alias: <b>confirm</b>)
             Ask for confirmation before executing <i>command</i>.  If <b>-p </b>is given,
             <i>prompt</i> is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is con‐
             structed from <i>command</i>.  It may contain the special character
             sequences supported by the <b>status-left </b>option.

             This command works only from inside <b>tmux</b>.

     <b>display-message </b>[<b>-p</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>message</i>]
                   (alias: <b>display</b>)
             Display a message.  If <b>-p </b>is given, the output is printed to
             stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the <i>target-client</i> status
             line.  The format of <i>message</i> is described in the <i>FORMATS</i> sec‐
             tion; information is taken from <i>target-pane</i> if <b>-t </b>is given,
             otherwise the active pane for the session attached to
             <i>target-client</i>.

<h2><a id="BUFFERS" href="#BUFFERS"></a>BUFFERS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>maintains a set of named <i>paste buffers</i>.  Each buffer may be either
     explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named
     when created with the <b>set-buffer </b>or <b>load-buffer </b>commands, or by renam‐
     ing an automatically named buffer with <b>set-buffer -n</b>.  Automatically
     named buffers are given a name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and
     so on.  When the <b>buffer-limit </b>option is reached, the oldest automati‐
     cally named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not sub‐
     ject to <b>buffer-limit </b>and may be deleted with <b>delete-buffer </b>command.

     Buffers may be added using <b>copy-mode </b>or the <b>set-buffer </b>and <b>load-buffer</b>
     commands, and pasted into a window using the <b>paste-buffer </b>command.  If
     a buffer command is used and no buffer is specified, the most recently
     added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By
     default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the
     <b>history-limit </b>option (see the <b>set-option </b>command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     <b>choose-buffer </b>[<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-O </b><i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>template</i>]
             Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen
             interactively from a list.  The following keys may be used in
             buffer mode:

                   <b>Key    Function</b>
                   Enter  Choose selected buffer
                   Up     Select previous buffer
                   Down   Select next buffer
                   C-s    Search by name or content
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                   T      Tag no buffers
                   C-t    Tag all buffers
                   d      Delete selected buffer
                   D      Delete tagged buffers
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   q      Exit mode

             After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name
             in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a command.  If <i>template</i>
             is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used.

             <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘time’, ‘name’ or
             ‘size’.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter.  This command works
             only if at least one client is attached.

     <b>clear-history </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>clearhist</b>)
             Remove and free the history for the specified pane.

     <b>delete-buffer </b>[<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>]
                   (alias: <b>deleteb</b>)
             Delete the buffer named <i>buffer-name</i>, or the most recently added
             automatically named buffer if not specified.

     <b>list-buffers </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>]
                   (alias: <b>lsb</b>)
             List the global buffers.  For the meaning of the <b>-F </b>flag, see
             the <i>FORMATS</i> section.

     <b>load-buffer </b>[<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] <i>path</i>
                   (alias: <b>loadb</b>)
             Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from <i>path</i>.

     <b>paste-buffer </b>[<b>-dpr</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>separator</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                   (alias: <b>pasteb</b>)
             Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.
             If not specified, paste into the current one.  With <b>-d</b>, also
             delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed (LF) char‐
             acters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by
             default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may be speci‐
             fied using the <b>-s </b>flag.  The <b>-r </b>flag means to do no replacement
             (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If <b>-p </b>is specified, paste
             bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer if the
             application has requested bracketed paste mode.

     <b>save-buffer </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] <i>path</i>
                   (alias: <b>saveb</b>)
             Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to <i>path</i>.  The
             <b>-a </b>option appends to rather than overwriting the file.

     <b>set-buffer </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>new-buffer-name</i>] <i>data</i>
                   (alias: <b>setb</b>)
             Set the contents of the specified buffer to <i>data</i>.  The <b>-a</b>
             option appends to rather than overwriting the buffer.  The <b>-n</b>
             option renames the buffer to <i>new-buffer-name</i>.

     <b>show-buffer </b>[<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>]
                   (alias: <b>showb</b>)
             Display the contents of the specified buffer.

<h2><a id="MISCELLANEOUS" href="#MISCELLANEOUS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

     <b>clock-mode </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
             Display a large clock.

     <b>if-shell </b>[<b>-bF</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>shell-command command</i> [<i>command</i>]
                   (alias: <b>if</b>)
             Execute the first <i>command</i> if <i>shell-command</i> returns success or
             the second <i>command</i> otherwise.  Before being executed,
             <i>shell-command</i> is expanded using the rules specified in the
             <i>FORMATS</i> section, including those relevant to <i>target-pane</i>.  With
             <b>-b</b>, <i>shell-command</i> is run in the background.

             If <b>-F </b>is given, <i>shell-command</i> is not executed but considered
             success if neither empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).

     <b>lock-server</b>
                   (alias: <b>lock</b>)
             Lock each client individually by running the command specified
             by the <b>lock-command </b>option.

     <b>run-shell </b>[<b>-b</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>shell-command</i>
                   (alias: <b>run</b>)
             Execute <i>shell-command</i> in the background without creating a win‐
             dow.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using
             the rules specified in the <i>FORMATS</i> section.  With <b>-b</b>, the com‐
             mand is run in the background.  After it finishes, any output
             to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane specified by
             <b>-t </b>or the current pane if omitted).  If the command doesn't
             return success, the exit status is also displayed.

     <b>wait-for </b>[<b>-L </b>| <b>-S </b>| <b>-U</b>] <i>channel</i>
                   (alias: <b>wait</b>)
             When used without options, prevents the client from exiting
             until woken using <b>wait-for -S </b>with the same channel.  When <b>-L</b>
             is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try to lock
             the same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked
             with <b>wait-for -U</b>.  This command only works from outside <b>tmux</b>.

<h2><a id="TERMINFO_EXTENSIONS" href="#TERMINFO_EXTENSIONS"></a>TERMINFO EXTENSIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5):

     <i>Cs</i>, <i>Cr</i>  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argu‐
             ment and is used to set the colour; the second takes no argu‐
             ments and restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a
             sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour
             from inside <b>tmux</b>:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     <i>Ss</i>, <i>Se</i>  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this
             may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If <i>Se</i> is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the
             cursor style instead.

     <i>Tc</i>      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB
             escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

             If supported, this is used for the OSC initialize colour escape
             sequence (which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’
             capabilities to the <b>tmux </b>terminfo(5) entry).

     <i>Ms</i>      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection
             (clipboard).  See the <i>set-clipboard</i> option above and the
             xterm(1) man page.

<h2><a id="CONTROL_MODE" href="#CONTROL_MODE"></a>CONTROL MODE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
     <b>tmux </b>offers a textual interface called <i>control mode</i>.  This allows
     applications to communicate with <b>tmux </b>using a simple text-only proto‐
     col.

     In control mode, a client sends <b>tmux </b>commands or command sequences ter‐
     minated by newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one
     block of output on standard output.  An output block consists of a
     <i>%begin</i> line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output
     block ends with a <i>%end</i> or <i>%error</i>.  <i>%begin</i> and matching <i>%end</i> or <i>%error</i>
     have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command
     number.  For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     The <b>refresh-client -C </b>command may be used to set the size of a client
     in control mode.

     In control mode, <b>tmux </b>outputs notifications.  A notification will never
     occur inside an output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     <b>%client-session-changed </b><i>client session-id name</i>
             The client is now attached to the session with ID <i>session-id</i>,
             which is named <i>name</i>.

     <b>%exit </b>[<i>reason</i>]
             The <b>tmux </b>client is exiting immediately, either because it is
             not attached to any session or an error occurred.  If present,
             <i>reason</i> describes why the client exited.

     <b>%layout-change </b><i>window-id window-layout window-visible-layout</i>
             <i>window-flags</i>
             The layout of a window with ID <i>window-id</i> changed.  The new lay‐
             out is <i>window-layout</i>.  The window's visible layout is
             <i>window-visible-layout</i> and the window flags are <i>window-flags</i>.

     <b>%output </b><i>pane-id value</i>
             A window pane produced output.  <i>value</i> escapes non-printable
             characters and backslash as octal \xxx.

     <b>%pane-mode-changed </b><i>pane-id</i>
             The pane with ID <i>pane-id</i> has changed mode.

     <b>%session-changed </b><i>session-id name</i>
             The client is now attached to the session with ID <i>session-id</i>,
             which is named <i>name</i>.

     <b>%session-renamed </b><i>name</i>
             The current session was renamed to <i>name</i>.

     <b>%session-window-changed </b><i>session-id window-id</i>
             The session with ID <i>session-id</i> changed its active window to the
             window with ID <i>window-id</i>.

     <b>%sessions-changed</b>
             A session was created or destroyed.

     <b>%unlinked-window-add </b><i>window-id</i>
             The window with ID <i>window-id</i> was created but is not linked to
             the current session.

     <b>%window-add </b><i>window-id</i>
             The window with ID <i>window-id</i> was linked to the current session.

     <b>%window-close </b><i>window-id</i>
             The window with ID <i>window-id</i> closed.

     <b>%window-pane-changed </b><i>window-id pane-id</i>
             The active pane in the window with ID <i>window-id</i> changed to the
             pane with ID <i>pane-id</i>.

     <b>%window-renamed </b><i>window-id name</i>
             The window with ID <i>window-id</i> was renamed to <i>name</i>.

     To create a new <b>tmux </b>session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session,
     this is <b>new</b>:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.
     If there are several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’
     (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’
     (to select window 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and
     ‘C-b p’ to select the previous window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such
     as ssh(1) disconnection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up
     and down may be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the <b>tmux </b>server is started may be placed in the
     <i>~/.tmux.conf</i> configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30
     minutes of inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
