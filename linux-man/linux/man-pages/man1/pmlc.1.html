       <b>pmlc </b>may be used to change those metrics and instances which a
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> writes to a Performance Co-Pilot archive (see
       <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>), the frequency with which the metrics are collected and
       whether the logging is mandatory, advisory, on or off.  It also
       reports the current logging status of metrics and instances.  <b>pmlc</b>
       may be used to control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as well as
       those on the local host.

       Normally <b>pmlc </b>operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an alternative
       local PMNS is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       If the <b>-P </b>option is specified, <b>pmlc </b>will attempt to start with a
       connection to the primary pmlogger on the local host.  If the <b>-p</b>
       option is specified, then <b>pmlc </b>will attempt to start with a
       connection to the pmlogger on this TCP/IP <i>port</i>.  Alternatively, if
       <i>pid</i> is specified, a connection to the pmlogger instance with that
       process id will be attempted on startup.  The <b>-h </b>option may only be
       used if <b>-P, -p </b><i>port</i> or a <i>pid</i> is also specified.  In that case <b>pmlc</b>
       will initially connect to the specified (remote) pmlogger instance on
       <i>host</i> rather than the local host.  If the connection to the specified
       pmlogger instance cannot be established, <b>pmlc </b>will start with no
       connection.  These options typically allow the same file of <b>pmlc</b>
       commands to be directed to multiple pmlogger instances by varying the
       command line arguments.  Note that <b>-P</b>, <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <i>pid</i> and <b>-h </b>are used
       only when making an initial connection to a pmlogger instance.  They
       are not used as defaults if subsequent connections are made
       interactively (see the <b>connect </b>command below).

       By default, <b>pmlc </b>reports the time of day according to the local
       timezone on the system where <b>pmlc </b>is run.  The <b>-Z </b>option changes the
       timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as
       described in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.  The <b>-z </b>option changes the timezone to the
       timezone of the pmlogger instance from which information is being
       obtained.  Only one of <b>-z </b>or <b>-Z </b>may be specified.

       If standard input is from a tty, <b>pmlc </b>is interactive, with prompts.
       The <b>-i </b>flag may be used to force interactive behavior, and is
       typically used in conjunction with <b>-e </b>to echo all command input on
       standard output.

       The following commands may be used:

       <b>show </b>[ <b>loggers </b>] [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
           Displays the process identities of all pmlogger instances running
           on the local host (or <i>host</i>, if specified).  The primary pmlogger
           pid is parenthesized because it can be referred to as "primary"
           as well as by its pid.

       <b>connect </b><i>pid</i> [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
       <b>connect primary </b>[ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
           Connects <b>pmlc </b>to the specified pmlogger process.  Any existing
           connection to a pmlogger instance is closed first.  Each pmlogger
           instance will accept at most one connection at a time, so if the
           connection is successfully established, your <b>pmlc </b>will be the
           only one controlling the pmlogger instance it is connected to.

       <b>new volume</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger instance
           is established.  It tells the pmlogger to close the current
           volume of the log and open a new volume.  Closed volumes may be
           archived, e.g. as part of a regular log management procedure to
           control the size of the physical log files.

       <b>status</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger instance
           is established.  It prints information about the state of the
           pmlogger instance and its associated log.

       <b>timezone local </b>| <b>logger </b>| <b>"</b><i>timezone</i><b>"</b>
           This command sets the time zone used when times are printed.
           <b>local </b>means use the time zone of the machine that <b>pmlc </b>is running
           on.  <b>logger </b>means use the time zone of the machine where the
           pmlogger instance is running.  Alternatively an explicit <i>timezone</i>
           enclosed in quotes may be supplied (refer to <b>TZ </b>in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a> for
           details).  The default time zone is <b>local </b>unless one of the <b>-z </b>or
           <b>-Z </b>options has been supplied on the command line.

       <b>flush</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger instance
           is established, and requests the pmlogger instance to flush to
           disk all buffers associated with the current archive.  For old-
           timers, <b>sync </b>is a synonym for <b>flush</b>.  In current versions of
           <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> all writes are unbuffered and aligned with the
           logical records in the external files, so this command achieves
           nothing, but is retained for backwards compatibility.

       <b>help</b>
           Displays a summary of the available commands.
           <b>h </b>and <b>? </b>are synonyms for <b>help</b>.

       <b>quit</b>
           Exits from <b>pmlc</b>.

       The remaining commands query and change the logging state of metrics
       and instances.  They will work only if <b>pmlc </b>has a connection to a
       pmlogger instance.  Metrics may be specified as fully qualified names
       (e.g. hinv.ncpu) or subtrees of the PMNS (e.g. hinv) which are
       expanded to include all metrics in the subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu,
       hinv.cpuclock, etc.).  Lists of metrics may be specified by enclosing
       them in braces with spaces or a comma between metrics (e.g.
       {hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk}).  Subtrees of metrics may be included in such
       lists.

       Each individual metric specification may be further qualified with a
       space or comma separated list of instances in square brackets (e.g.
       kernel.all.load["1 minute", "5 minute"]).  External instance names or
       numeric internal instance identifiers or both may be used in the same
       list (e.g. sample.colour.[red,1,"blue"]).  If an instance
       qualification is applied to a subtree of the PMNS all of the metrics
       in the subtree must have the same instance domain.  Instance
       qualifications may not be applied to entire lists of metrics but may
       appear inside such lists.

       If no instances are specified for a metric, all instances are used.
       All instances means all instances available at the time the pmlogger
       instance in question fetches the metrics for logging.  If an instance
       domain changes over time this is not always the same as the set of
       instances displayed by <b>pmlc</b>, which can only display the currently
       available instances.  To prevent unintentional errors, only the
       instances that are currently available to <b>pmlc </b>may appear in instance
       specifications.

       <b>query </b><i>metriclist</i>
           The current logging state of each metric (and instances, where
           applicable) in <i>metriclist</i> is displayed.  This includes the
           logging state (e.g. on, maybe, off) and the logging interval for
           each metric (and instance) requested.  The following
           abbreviations pertaining to metrics (and instances) may appear in
           the output: <b>adv</b>, advisory; <b>mand</b>, mandatory; <b>nl</b>, not in the log;
           <b>na</b>, in the log but not currently available from its Performance
           Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  Where appropriate, an instance name
           will appear last on a line preceded by its numeric internal
           instance identifier.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory on </b><i>interval metriclist</i>
           This form of the <b>log </b>command turns on logging for the metrics
           (and any instances) in <i>metriclist.</i>  <i>interval</i> specifies how often
           the specified metrics/instances should be logged.  <b>once </b>indicates
           that the metrics/instances should appear at most once in the log.
           More often one would use the optional keyword <b>every </b>followed by a
           positive number and one of <b>millisecond </b>(or <b>msec</b>), <b>second </b>(or
           <b>sec</b>), <b>minute </b>(or <b>min</b>), <b>hour </b>or their plurals.
           Note that the keyword <b>default </b>which may be used for the default
           <i>interval</i> in a <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration file cannot be used in
           <b>pmlc</b>.
           Internal limitations require the <i>interval</i> to be less than
           (approximately) 74 hours.  An <i>interval</i> value of zero is a synonym
           for <b>once</b>.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory off </b><i>metriclist</i>
           This tells the pmlogger instance not to log any of the
           metrics/instances in <i>metriclist</i>.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory maybe </b><i>metriclist</i>
           This tells the pmlogger instance to honor any subsequent advisory
           logging requests for the metrics/instances in <i>metriclist</i>.  If the
           current logging state of the metrics/instances is mandatory
           (either on or off) the new state will be set to maybe
           (effectively advisory off).  If the current state of the
           metrics/instances is already advisory (either on or off) the
           state(s) for the metrics/instances will remain as they are.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>advisory on </b><i>interval metriclist</i>
       [ <b>log </b>] <b>advisory off </b><i>metriclist</i>
           Advisory logging is only applicable if the last logging state
           specified for a metric/instance was "mandatory maybe" (which
           permits subsequent advisory logging control) or if the logging
           state is already advisory.  These two statements turn advisory
           logging on or off (respectively) for the specified
           metrics/instances.
           The interpretation for <i>interval</i> is as above for the <b>mandatory</b>
           case.

       There is no continuation character required for commands that span
       lines.

       The word <b>at </b>may be used interchangeably with <b>@</b>.

       A request to log all instances of a metric will supersede any prior
       request to log either all or specific instances of a metric (if the
       request specifies a permissible transition in the logging state).  A
       request to log specific instances of a metric when all instances of a
       metric are already being logged is refused by <b>pmlogger</b>.

<h2><a id="ACCESS_CONTROL" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL"></a>ACCESS CONTROL  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>pmlc </b>may have restricted access to and control over <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       processes.

       If a <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is unable to export its control information to the
       local <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, then that <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> cannot cannot be connected to
       nor controlled by <b>pmlc</b>.  In practice, this means the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       process has to be owned by the user ``pcp'' and/or the group ``pcp''.
       If <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is running on the host ``foo'' then use ``pminfo -f -h
       foo pmcd.pmlogger'' to verify that the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> of interest is
       known to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, alternatively <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances that are not
       reported from the <b>pmlc show loggers @foo </b>command are not known to
       <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the host ``foo''.

       If <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is launched with a configuration file that contains an
       <b>[access] </b>section, then <b>pmlc </b>will be unable to connect to that
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> unless the access controls allow <b>some </b>access from the
       host where <b>pmlc </b>is being run.  Minimally this requires the <b>enquire</b>
       access to be permitted in the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> access control section.

       If all instances of a metric are being logged and a request is made
       to log specific instances of the metric with the same state and
       frequency, the request may appear to succeed, even though <b>pmlogger</b>
       has refused the request.  This is not normally a problem, as the
       required information will still be placed into the log by <b>pmlogger</b>.

       However in the case where the metric is to be logged once, the
       outcome is not what might be expected.  When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a
       request to log a metric once, it places the current value(s) of the
       metric into the log as soon as it can, regardless of whether the
       metric is already in the log.  This may be used to force values into
       the log.  When a request to log specific instances of a metric
       arrives and is refused because all instances of the metric are
       already being logged, <b>pmlogger </b>does not place values for the
       instances requested into the log.  It returns the current logging
       state for each instance requested to <b>pmlc</b>.  The requested and
       returned states are identical, so <b>pmlc </b>doesn't raise an error as it
       should.

       To ensure that only certain instances of a metric are being logged,
       one should always turn off logging for all instances of the metric
       prior to turning on logging for the specific instances required.
