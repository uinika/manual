       The <b>iostat </b>command is used for monitoring system input/output device
       loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to
       their average transfer rates. The <b>iostat </b>command generates reports
       that can be used to change system configuration to better balance the
       input/output load between physical disks.

       The first report generated by the <b>iostat </b>command provides statistics
       concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the <b>-y </b>option
       is used (in this case, this first report is omitted).  Each
       subsequent report covers the time since the previous report. All
       statistics are reported each time the <b>iostat </b>command is run. The
       report consists of a CPU header row followed by a row of CPU
       statistics. On multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated
       system-wide as averages among all processors. A device header row is
       displayed followed by a line of statistics for each device that is
       configured.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter. If the <i>count</i> parameter is
       specified, the value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports
       generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is
       specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>iostat </b>command generates
       reports continuously.

       The <b>iostat </b>command generates two types of reports, the CPU
       Utilization report and the Device Utilization report.

       CPU Utilization Report
              The first report generated by the <b>iostat </b>command is the CPU
              Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU values
              are global averages among all processors.  The report has the
              following format:

              <b>%user</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred
                     while executing at the user level (application).

              <b>%nice</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred
                     while executing at the user level with nice priority.

              <b>%system</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred
                     while executing at the system level (kernel).

              <b>%iowait</b>
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle during which the system had an outstanding disk
                     I/O request.

              <b>%steal</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait
                     by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was
                     servicing another virtual processor.

              <b>%idle</b>
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk
                     I/O request.

       Device Utilization Report
              The second report generated by the <b>iostat </b>command is the
              Device Utilization Report. The device report provides
              statistics on a per physical device or partition basis. Block
              devices and partitions for which statistics are to be
              displayed may be entered on the command line.  If no device
              nor partition is entered, then statistics are displayed for
              every device used by the system, and providing that the kernel
              maintains statistics for it.  If the <b>ALL </b>keyword is given on
              the command line, then statistics are displayed for every
              device defined by the system, including those that have never
              been used.  Transfer rates are shown in 1K blocks by default,
              unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in
              which case 512-byte blocks are used.  The report may show the
              following fields, depending on the flags used:

              <b>Device:</b>
                     This column gives the device (or partition) name as
                     listed in the /dev directory.

              <b>tps</b>
                     Indicate the number of transfers per second that were
                     issued to the device. A transfer is an I/O request to
                     the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined
                     into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is
                     of indeterminate size.

              <b>Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)</b>
                     Indicate the amount of data read from the device
                     expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
                     per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and
                     therefore have a size of 512 bytes.

              <b>Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)</b>
                     Indicate the amount of data written to the device
                     expressed in a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
                     per second.

              <b>Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)</b>
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

              <b>Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)</b>
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
                     written.

              <b>r/s</b>
                     The number (after merges) of read requests completed
                     per second for the device.

              <b>w/s</b>
                     The number (after merges) of write requests completed
                     per second for the device.

              <b>sec/s (kB/s, MB/s)</b>
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from
                     or written to the device per second.

              <b>rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)</b>
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from
                     the device per second.

              <b>wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)</b>
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to
                     the device per second.

              <b>rqm/s</b>
                     The number of I/O requests merged per second that were
                     queued to the device.

              <b>rrqm/s</b>
                     The number of read requests merged per second that were
                     queued to the device.

              <b>wrqm/s</b>
                     The number of write requests merged per second that
                     were queued to the device.

              <b>%rrqm</b>
                     The percentage of read requests merged together before
                     being sent to the device.

              <b>%wrqm</b>
                     The percentage of write requests merged together before
                     being sent to the device.

              <b>areq-sz</b>
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests
                     that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              <b>rareq-sz</b>
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the read requests
                     that were issued to the device.

              <b>wareq-sz</b>
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the write requests
                     that were issued to the device.

              <b>await</b>
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the
                     time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              <b>r_await</b>
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for read requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the
                     time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              <b>w_await</b>
                     The average time (in milliseconds) for write requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the
                     time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              <b>aqu-sz</b>
                     The average queue length of the requests that were
                     issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgqu-sz.

              <b>svctm</b>
                     The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O
                     requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do
                     not trust this field any more.  This field will be
                     removed in a future sysstat version.

              <b>%util</b>
                     Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests
                     were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for
                     the device). Device saturation occurs when this value
                     is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially.
                     But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as
                     RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not
                     reflect their performance limits.

       -c     Display the CPU utilization report.

       -d     Display the device utilization report.

       -g group_name { device [...] | ALL }
              Display statistics for a group of devices.  The <b>iostat </b>command
              reports statistics for each individual device in the list then
              a line of global statistics for the group displayed as
              <b>group_name </b>and made up of all the devices in the list. The <b>ALL</b>
              keyword means that all the block devices defined by the system
              shall be included in the group.

       -H     This option must be used with option -g and indicates that
              only global statistics for the group are to be displayed, and
              not statistics for individual devices in the group.

       -h     Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by a human.
              <b>--human </b>is enabled implicitly with this option.

       --human
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1k, 1.23M, etc.)
              The units displayed with this option supersede any other
              default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with
              the metrics.

       -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] | ALL ]
              Display persistent device names. Options <b>ID</b>, <b>LABEL</b>, etc.
              specify the type of the persistent name. These options are not
              limited, only prerequisite is that directory with required
              persistent names is present in <i>/dev/disk</i>.  Optionally,
              multiple devices can be specified in the chosen persistent
              name type.  Because persistent device names are usually long,
              option

       -k     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.

       -m     Display statistics in megabytes per second.

       -N     Display the registered device mapper names for any device
              mapper devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.

       -o JSON
              Display the statistics in JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
              format.  JSON output field order is undefined, and new fields
              may be added in the future.

       -p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]
              The -p option displays statistics for block devices and all
              their partitions that are used by the system.  If a device
              name is entered on the command line, then statistics for it
              and all its partitions are displayed. Last, the <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the
              block devices and partitions defined by the system, including
              those that have never been used. If option <b>-j </b>is defined
              before this option, devices entered on the command line can be
              specified with the chosen persistent name type.

       -s     Display a short (narrow) version of the report that should fit
              in 80 characters wide screens.

       -t     Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format
              may depend on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment
              variable (see below).

       -V     Print version number then exit.

       -x     Display extended statistics.

       -y     Omit first report with statistics since system boot, if
              displaying multiple records at given interval.

       The <b>iostat </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              When this variable is set, transfer rates are shown in
              512-byte blocks instead of the default 1K blocks.

       S_COLORS
              When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the
              terminal.  Possible values for this variable are <i>never</i>, <i>always</i>
              or <i>auto</i> (the latter is the default).

              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other
              color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind
              of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates
              different ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-separated
              list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22</b>.  Supported capabilities
              are:

                     values greater than or equal to 75%.

              <b>I=     </b>SGR substring for device names.

              <b>M=     </b>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from
                     50% to 75%.

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the current
              locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report
              header. The <b>iostat </b>command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-
              MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp displayed with option -t will
              also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

       <i>/proc</i> filesystem must be mounted for <b>iostat </b>to work.

       Kernels older than 2.6.x are no longer supported.

       The average service time (svctm field) value is meaningless, as I/O
       statistics are now calculated at block level, and we don't know when
       the disk driver starts to process a request. For this reason, this
       field will be removed in a future sysstat version.
