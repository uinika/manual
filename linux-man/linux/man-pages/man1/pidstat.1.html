       The <b>pidstat </b>command is used for monitoring individual tasks currently
       being managed by the Linux kernel.  It writes to standard output
       activities for every task selected with option <b>-p </b>or for every task
       managed by the Linux kernel if option <b>-p ALL </b>has been used. Not
       selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying <b>-p ALL </b>but only
       active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values) will appear in
       the report.

       The <b>pidstat </b>command can also be used for monitoring the child
       processes of selected tasks.  Read about option <b>-T </b>below.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported for the time since
       system startup (boot).  The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter if this one is not set to
       zero. The value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports generated
       at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified
       without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>pidstat </b>command generates reports
       continuously.

       You can select information about specific task activities using
       flags.  Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

       -C comm
              Display only tasks whose command name includes the string
              <i>comm</i>.  This string can be a regular expression.

       -d     Report I/O statistics (kernels 2.6.20 and later only).  The
              following values may be displayed:

              <b>UID</b>
                     The real user identification number of the task being
                     monitored.

              <b>USER</b>
                     The name of the real user owning the task being
                     monitored.

              <b>PID</b>
                     The identification number of the task being monitored.

              <b>kB_rd/s</b>
                     Number of kilobytes the task has caused to be read from
                     disk per second.

              <b>kB_wr/s</b>
                     Number of kilobytes the task has caused, or shall cause
                     to be written to disk per second.

              <b>kB_ccwr/s</b>
                     Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has been
                     cancelled by the task. This may occur when the task
                     truncates some dirty pagecache. In this case, some IO
                     which another task has been accounted for will not be
                     happening.

              <b>iodelay</b>
                     Block I/O delay of the task being monitored, measured
                     in clock ticks. This metric includes the delays spent
                     waiting for sync block I/O completion and for swapin
                     block I/O completion.

              <b>Command</b>
                     The command name of the task.

       -G process_name
              Display only processes whose command name includes the string
              <i>process_name</i>.  This string can be a regular expression. If
              option -t is used together with option -G then the threads
              belonging to that process are also displayed (even if their
              command name doesn't include the string <i>process_name</i>).

       -h     Display all activities horizontally on a single line. This is
              intended to make it easier to be parsed by other programs.

       --human
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1k, 1.23M, etc.)
              The units displayed with this option supersede any other
              default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with
              the metrics.

       -I     In an SMP environment, indicate that tasks CPU usage (as
              displayed by option <b>-u </b>) should be divided by the total number
              of processors.

       -l     Display the process command name and all its arguments.

       -p { pid [,...] | SELF | ALL }
              Select tasks (processes) for which statistics are to be
              reported.  <i>pid</i> is the process identification number. The <b>SELF</b>
              keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported for the
              <b>pidstat </b>process itself, whereas the <b>ALL </b>keyword indicates that
              statistics are to be reported for all the tasks managed by the
              system.

       -R     Report realtime priority and scheduling policy information.
              The following values may be displayed:

              <b>UID</b>
                     The real user identification number of the task being
                     monitored.

                     monitored.

              <b>USER</b>
                     The name of the real user owning the task being
                     monitored.

              <b>PID</b>
                     The identification number of the task being monitored.

              <b>threads</b>
                     Number of threads associated with current task.

              <b>fd-nr</b>
                     Number of file descriptors associated with current
                     task.

              <b>Command</b>
                     The command name of the task.

       -w     Report task switching activity (kernels 2.6.23 and later
              only).  The following values may be displayed:

              <b>UID</b>
                     The real user identification number of the task being
                     monitored.

              <b>USER</b>
                     The name of the real user owning the task being
                     monitored.

              <b>PID</b>
                     The identification number of the task being monitored.

              <b>cswch/s</b>
                     Total number of voluntary context switches the task
                     made per second.  A voluntary context switch occurs
                     when a task blocks because it requires a resource that
                     is unavailable.

              <b>nvcswch/s</b>
                     Total number of non voluntary context switches the task
                     made per second.  A involuntary context switch takes
                     place when a task executes for the duration of its time
                     slice and then is forced to relinquish the processor.

              <b>Command</b>
                     The command name of the task.

       The <b>pidstat </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       S_COLORS
              When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the
              terminal.  Possible values for this variable are <i>never</i>, <i>always</i>
              or <i>auto</i> (the latter is the default).

              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other
              color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind
              of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates
              different ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-separated
              list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22</b>.  Supported capabilities
              are:

              <b>H=     </b>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage
                     values greater than or equal to 75%.

              <b>I=     </b>SGR substring for item values like PID, UID or CPU
                     number.

              <b>M=     </b>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from
                     50% to 75%.

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values and for
                     tasks names.

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values and for threads names.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the current
              locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report
              header.  The <b>pidstat </b>command will use the ISO 8601 format
              (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also be compliant
              with ISO 8601 format.

       <b>pidstat 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of CPU statistics for every active task
              in the system at two second intervals.

       <b>pidstat -r -p 1643 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of page faults and memory statistics for
              PID 1643 at two second intervals.

       <b>pidstat -C "fox|bird" -r -p ALL</b>
              Display global page faults and memory statistics for all the
              processes whose command name includes the string "fox" or
              "bird".

       <b>pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of page faults statistics at two second
              intervals for the child processes of all tasks in the system.
              Only child processes with non-zero statistics values are
              displayed.
