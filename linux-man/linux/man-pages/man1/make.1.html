</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>make</i> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large
       program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile
       them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of <b>make</b>, which was
       written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently
       maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they
       are very common, but you can use <b>make </b>with any programming language
       whose compiler can be run with a shell command.  In fact, <b>make </b>is not
       limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some
       files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others
       change.

       To prepare to use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the <i>makefile</i>
       that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the
       states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically
       the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn
       made by compiling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source
       files, this simple shell command:

              <b>make</b>

       suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <b>make </b>program
       uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the
       files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of
       those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.

       <b>make </b>executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or more target
       <i>names</i>, where <i>name</i> is typically a program.  If no <b>-f </b>option is
       present, <b>make </b>will look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>, <i>makefile</i>, and
       <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or <i>Makefile</i>.
       (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it appears prominently near the
       beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files
       such as <i>README</i>.)  The first name checked, <i>GNUmakefile</i>, is not
       recommended for most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have
       a makefile that is specific to GNU <b>make</b>, and will not be understood
       by other versions of <b>make</b>.  If <i>makefile</i> is '-', the standard input is
       read.

       <b>make </b>updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have
       been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target
       does not exist.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>-m</b>
            These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions
            of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--always-make</b>
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       <b>-C </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i>
            Change to directory <i>dir</i> before reading the makefiles or doing
            anything else.  If multiple <b>-C </b>options are specified, each is
            interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C </b>/ <b>-C </b>etc is
            equivalent to <b>-C </b>/etc.  This is typically used with recursive
            invocations of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-d   </b>Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
            The debugging information says which files are being considered
            for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what
            results, which files actually need to be remade, which implicit
            rules are considered and which are applied---everything
            interesting about how <b>make </b>decides what to do.

       <b>--debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i>
            Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.
            If the <i>FLAGS</i> are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <b>-d</b>
            was specified.  <i>FLAGS</i> may be <i>a</i> for all debugging output (same as
            using <b>-d</b>), <i>b</i> for basic debugging, <i>v</i> for more verbose basic
            debugging, <i>i</i> for showing implicit rules, <i>j</i> for details on
            invocation of commands, and <i>m</i> for debugging while remaking
            makefiles.  Use <i>n</i> to disable all previous debugging flags.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--environment-overrides</b>
            Give variables taken from the environment precedence over
            variables from makefiles.

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>, <b>--file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i>
            Use <i>file</i> as a makefile.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-errors</b>
            Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--include-dir</b>=<i>dir</i>
            Specifies a directory <i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles.  If
            several <b>-I </b>options are used to specify several directories, the
            directories are searched in the order specified.  Unlike the
            arguments to other flags of <b>make</b>, directories given with <b>-I</b>
            flags may come directly after the flag: <b>-I</b><i>dir</i> is allowed, as
            well as <b>-I </b><i>dir</i>.  This syntax is allowed for compatibility with
            the C preprocessor's <b>-I </b>flag.

       <b>-j </b>[<i>jobs</i>], <b>--jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]
            Specifies the number of <i>jobs</i> (commands) to run simultaneously.
            If there is more than one <b>-j </b>option, the last one is effective.
            If the <b>-j </b>option is given without an argument, <b>make </b>will not
            limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
            Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
            that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the
            other dependencies of these targets can be processed all the
            same.

       <b>-l </b>[<i>load</i>], <b>--load-average</b>[=<i>load</i>]
            Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there
            are others jobs running and the load average is at least <i>load</i> (a
            floating-point number).  With no argument, removes a previous
            load limit.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--check-symlink-times</b>
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>
            Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute
            them (except in certain circumstances).

       <b>-o </b><i>file</i>, <b>--old-file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--assume-old</b>=<i>file</i>
            Do not remake the file <i>file</i> even if it is older than its
            dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of changes
            in <i>file</i>.  Essentially the file is treated as very old and its
            rules are ignored.

       <b>-O</b>[<i>type</i>], <b>--output-sync</b>[=<i>type</i>]
            When running multiple jobs in parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the
            output of each job is collected together rather than
            interspersed with output from other jobs.  If <i>type</i> is not
            specified or is <b>target </b>the output from the entire recipe for
            each target is grouped together.  If <i>type</i> is <b>line </b>the output
            from each command line within a recipe is grouped together.  If
            <i>type</i> is <b>recurse </b>output from an entire recursive make is grouped
            together.  If <i>type</i> is <b>none </b>output synchronization is disabled.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-data-base</b>
            Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results
            from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as
            otherwise specified.  This also prints the version information
            given by the <b>-v </b>switch (see below).  To print the data base
            without trying to remake any files, use <i>make -p -f/dev/null</i>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--question</b>
            ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print anything;
            just return an exit status that is zero if the specified targets
            are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-builtin-rules</b>
            Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules.  Also clear out
            the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-builtin-variables</b>
            Don't define any built-in variables.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are
            executed.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b>
            Cancel the effect of the <b>-k </b>option.  This is never necessary
            except in a recursive <b>make </b>where <b>-k </b>might be inherited from the
            top-level <b>make </b>via MAKEFLAGS or if you set <b>-k </b>in MAKEFLAGS in
            your environment.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b>
            Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
            instead of running their commands.  This is used to pretend that
            the commands were done, in order to fool future invocations of
            <b>make</b>.

       <b>--trace</b>
            Information about the disposition of each target is printed (why
            the target is being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild
            it).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print the version of the <b>make </b>program plus a copyright, a list
            of authors and a notice that there is no warranty.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--print-directory</b>
            Print a message containing the working directory before and
            after other processing.  This may be useful for tracking down
            errors from complicated nests of recursive <b>make </b>commands.

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
            Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       <b>-W </b><i>file</i>, <b>--what-if</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--new-file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--assume-new</b>=<i>file</i>
            Pretend that the target <i>file</i> has just been modified.  When used
            with the <b>-n </b>flag, this shows you what would happen if you were
            to modify that file.  Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the same as
            running a <i>touch</i> command on the given file before running <b>make</b>,
            except that the modification time is changed only in the
            imagination of <b>make</b>.

       <b>--warn-undefined-variables</b>
            Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.

<h2><a id="EXIT_STATUS" href="#EXIT_STATUS"></a>EXIT STATUS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       GNU <b>make </b>exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were
       successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed.  A status
       of one will be returned if the <b>-q </b>flag was used and <b>make </b>determines
       that a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be returned
       if any errors were encountered.
