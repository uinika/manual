<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>pmview </b>is a generalized 3D performance metrics visualization tool for
       the Performance Co-Pilot (<a href="pcp.1.html">PCP(1)</a>).

       <b>pmview </b>is the base utility behind performance metrics visualization
       tools such as <b>dkvis</b>(1), <b>mpvis</b>(1), <b>osvis</b>(1) and <b>nfsvis</b>(1), It is also
       used by a range of related tools that are specific to optional
       Performance Domain Agents (PMDA) and/or PCP add-on products.  <b>pmview</b>
       may also be used to construct customized 3D performance displays.

       <b>pmview </b>displays performance metrics as colored blocks and cylinders
       arranged on monochrome base planes. Each object may represent a
       single performance metric, or a stack of several performance metrics.
       Since the objects are modulated by the value of the metric they
       represent, only numerical metrics may be visualized.  Objects
       representing a single metric may be modulated in terms of height,
       color, or height and color.  Objects in a stack may only be height
       modulated, but the stack can be normalized to the maximum height.
       Labels may be added to the scene to help identify groups of metrics.

       A configuration file (as specified by the <b>-c </b>option, or read from
       standard input) is used to specify the position, color, maximum value
       and labels of metrics and metric instances in the scene.  The maximum
       value acts as a normalization factor and is used to scale the object
       height and/or color in proportion to the metric values.  Metric
       values which exceed the associated maximum value are displayed as
       solid white objects.  If a metric is unavailable, the object will
       have minimum height and will be colored grey.

       Normally, the tool operates in ``live'' mode where performance
       metrics are fetched in real-time.  The user can view metrics from any
       host running <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  <b>pmview </b>can also replay archives of performance
       metrics (see <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>) and allow the user to interactively control
       the current replay time and rate using the VCR paradigm.  This is
       particularly useful for retrospective comparisons and for post-mortem
       analysis of performance problems where a remote system is not
       accessible or a performance analyst is not available on-site.

       All metrics in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) with numeric
       value semantics from any number of hosts or archives may be
       visualized.  <b>pmview </b>examines the semantics of the metrics and where
       sensible, converts metric values to a rate before scaling.
</pre>
<h2><a id="COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS" href="#COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS"></a>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>-S</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-O </b>and <b>-A </b>options may be used to define a time window to
       restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within the time
       window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample times; refer
       to <b>PCPIntro(1) </b>for a complete description of these options.

       The other available options are:

       <b>-a </b><i>archive</i>[<b>,</b><i>archive</i><b>,</b>...]]
              Specify an <i>archive</i> from which metrics can be obtained for a
              particular host.  <i>archive</i> is the basename of an archive, or
              the name of a directory conytaining archives, previously
              created by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  Multiple sets of archives (separated
              by commas or in different <b>-a </b>options) from different hosts may
              be given, but an error will occur if there is more than one
              set of archives from the same host. Any metrics that are not
              associated with a specific host or archive in the
              configuration file will use the first set of archives as their
              source.

       <b>-C     </b>Parse the configuration file and exit before displaying the
              <b>pmview </b>window.  Any errors in the configuration file are
              displayed.

       <b>-c </b><i>configfile</i>
              Load the configuration from <i>configfile</i> rather than standard
              input.

       <b>-h </b><i>host</i>
              Fetch performance metrics from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on <i>host</i>, rather than
              the default localhost.  Implies that <b>pmview </b>will run in live
              mode, so no archives can be specified on the command line or
              in the configuration file.  Only one <b>-h </b>option may be given.

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>
              Normally <b>pmview </b>operates on the distributed Performance
              Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is
              specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
              <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>
              Connect to the time controls (see <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>) on this <b>port</b>.
              Used when a tool launches another tool so that they can
              connect to the same time controls.

       <b>-R </b><i>logconfig</i>
              Use <i>logconfig</i> as the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> config when recording.

       <b>-r </b><i>addconfig</i>
              Append <i>addconfig</i> onto the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> config generated by
              <b>pmview </b>when recording.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>
              The update <i>interval</i> used to fetch metrics from the live or
              archive sources.  The <i>interval</i> argument follows the syntax
              described in <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, and in the simplest form may be an
              unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).
              The default is 2.0 seconds.

       <b>-x </b><i>version</i>
              Use the specified <i>version</i> of the <b>pmlaunch</b>(5) specification.
              The versions currently supported are ``1.0'' and the default
              version ``2.0''.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>
              By default, <b>pmview </b>reports the time of day according to the
              local timezone on the system where <b>pmview </b>is run.  The <b>-Z</b>
              option changes the default timezone to <i>timezone</i> which should
              be in the format of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described
              in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.

       <b>-z     </b>Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
              host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
              identified via either the <b>-h </b>option, or the first <b>-a </b>option.

       <b>-geometry </b><i>geometry</i>
       <b>-display </b><i>display</i>
       <b>-name </b><i>name</i>
       <b>-title </b><i>title</i>
       <b>-xrm "</b><i>resourceName: value</i><b>"</b>

              Most standard <b>X</b>(1) command line arguments may be used.
</pre>
<h2><a id="WINDOW" href="#WINDOW"></a>WINDOW  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>pmview </b>window is comprised of a menu bar, time and scale
       controls, metric and time values, and an ``examiner'' viewer (see
       <b>ivview</b>(1)), which displays the 3D scene.
</pre>
<h2><a id="EXAMINER_VIEWER" href="#EXAMINER_VIEWER"></a>EXAMINER VIEWER  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The left, right and bottom edges of the examiner viewer contain a
       variety of thumb wheels and buttons that can be used to adjust the
       visualization of the 3D scene.  The <i>Rotx</i> and <i>Roty</i> thumb wheels allow
       the user to rotate the scene about the x and y axes, respectively.
       The <i>dolly</i> thumb wheel moves the virtual camera closer and further
       from the scene allowing the user to examine specific parts in detail
       or view the entire scene.  On the right edge of the viewer are eight
       buttons which affect the way the user can interact with the scene.

       <i>Pointer</i>
           Changes the cursor to a pointer which allows blocks to be
           selected in the scene.  See the Metric Selection section below.

       <i>Hand</i>
           Changes the cursor to a hand which allows the scene to be
           rotated, translated and dollied using a combination of mouse
           buttons.  The left mouse button can be used to rotate the scene
           in the direction of the mouse.  Releasing the left mouse button
           before the mouse has stopped moving will cause the scene to
           continue to rotate, which can be stopped by pressing the left
           mouse button again.  The middle mouse button will ``pan'' the
           scene, and both mouse buttons act as a dolly for the virtual
           camera.

       <i>Question Mark</i>
           Displays the SGI Help information for the examiner viewer.

       <i>Home</i>
           Changes the scene back to its original position, unless the home
           position has been changed by the home pointer button.

       <i>Home Pointer</i>
           Changes the home position of the scene to be the scene currently
           in view.

       <i>Eye</i> Resizes the scene so that it completely fits into the 3D viewing
           area.

       <i>Cross-hairs</i>
           Moves the object under the cursor to the center of the viewing
           area, if the hand cursor has been selected.  Pressing the ``s''
           key while the cursor is over an object has the same effect.

       <i>Perspective Box</i>
           Switches the display between perspective and orthogonal
           projections.

       Pressing the right mouse button within the scene window will bring up
       a menu of options which affect how the 3D scene is drawn.  The
       options include drawing the blocks as wire frames, and turning on
       stereo viewing.
</pre>
<h2><a id="METRIC_SELECTION" href="#METRIC_SELECTION"></a>METRIC SELECTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       When the pointer cursor is active, more information about the 3D
       scene can be obtained.  Text describing the metric represented by the
       block under the cursor will be displayed in the top text box of the
       <b>pmview </b>window.  The text contains the source and name of the metric,
       current value and units, and the percentage of the expected maximum
       (or normalization) value.  The text box is updated whenever the scene
       is updated with the latest metric values or when the cursor is moved
       over another block in the scene.  Moving the cursor over a base plane
       block, text or the surrounding space will clear the text box.

       Clicking the left mouse button on a block will bind the text box on
       that metric instance so that the metric can be monitored while
       performing other actions with the mouse.  The block will be
       highlighted with a red wire frame.  Clicking the left mouse button on
       text or the space surrounding the scene will unselect the object,
       causing the text box to revert to the original behavior of showing
       the metric underneath the cursor.

       Selecting a base plane instead of a modulated block will cause all
       the blocks on that base plane to be selected.  When more than one
       object is selected, the text box behaves as if nothing is selected,
       so the metric displayed is the metric currently under the cursor.
       Multiple selections are also possible by pressing the SHIFT key while
       selecting an object with the left mouse button.

<h2><a id="MENUS" href="#MENUS"></a>MENUS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There are four menus in <b>pmview</b>'s user interface which allow scenes to
       be recorded, saved and printed (<b>File</b>), access to the time controls
       (<b>Options</b>), launching other tools (<b>Launch</b>) and online help (<b>Help</b>).

       <b>File/Record</b>
           When in ``live'' mode, this option will launch <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
           processes to record the current scene into an archive folio (see
           <a href="pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a>) so that it may be replayed at a later time.  This
           option is not available in ``replay'' mode.

           When <b>File/Record </b>is selected, a file chooser dialog will prompt
           for the name of the new archive folio.  If the directory to the
           folio does not exist, <b>pmview </b>will attempt to create it.  It is
           usually convenient to keep each folio within its own directory as
           there will be several other files associated with the folio,
           including the generated archives.

           Once a valid folio has been created, <b>pmview </b>will launch a
           <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process for each host to collect the metrics required
           from that host in the current scene.  The current selections do
           not affect the set of metrics that are recorded.

           While recording is in progress, a red dot will appear in the time
           controls button in the top left-hand corner of the <b>pmview </b>window.
           The <b>File/Record </b>option will also change to <b>File/Stop Recording </b>as
           only one recording session is possible at any one time.
           Selecting blocks or launching other tools will have no affect on
           the recording session.

           The record session may be terminated by selecting <b>File/Stop</b>
           <b>Recording</b>.  This will display dialogs for each <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
           instance describing the size and location of the archive files
           before terminating each process.  When all <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes
           have been terminated, the red dot is removed from the time
           controls button, and the menu reverts back to <b>File/Record </b>to
           allow another recording session to take place.

           If the application exists while recording, a dialog will appear
           allowing you to terminate each <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process, or leave it
           running unattached.

           An archive folio may be replayed using the command: ``<b>pmafm </b><i>folio</i>
           <b>replay</b>''.  See <a href="pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a> for more details.

           It is not uncommon for a front-end script which generates a
           <b>pmview </b>scene to use metrics that are not contained in the scene.
           For example, <b>osvis</b>(1) uses several <i>hinv</i> metrics to determine the
           size and layout of some objects.  As these metrics are also
           needed when replaying the generated archive with the front-end
           script, a complete <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> config can be specified (<b>-R</b>) that
           overrides the <b>pmview </b>generated config, or an additional config
           can be appended (<b>-r</b>) to the <b>pmview </b>generated config.

       <b>File/Save</b>
           Saves the current scene to a human-readable Open Inventor file
           (see <b>inventor</b>(1)).  A file dialog will prompt for the location of
           the file.  The default file extension is ``.iv'' which is
           recognized by <b>ivview</b>(1) and some Web browsers.

       <b>File/Print</b>
           Outputs the current scene to a printer.  A print dialog will be
           displayed allowing a specific printer to be selected.

       <b>File/Quit</b>
           <b>pmview </b>immediately exits.  If recording was active, dialogs will
           be displayed for each <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process so that they may be
           terminated.

       <b>Options/Show Time Control</b>
           Displays the time controls (see <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>) that are driving this
           instance of <b>pmview</b>.  The time controls may be shared by other
           tools, including <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, that have been launched by other
           instances of <b>pmview </b>and <b>oview</b>(1).  Therefore, this menu item may
           appear to have no affect if the time controls are already
           visible.

       <b>Options/New Time Control</b>
           Disconnect with the current time controls (which may be shared by
           other tools, see <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>) and use a new time control that is
           not connected to any other tools.  The new time control will be
           immediately displayed.

       <b>Launch</b>
           The launch menu is generated from a menu specification file (see
           <b>pmlaunch</b>(5)).  The menu contains tools that may be launched based
           on the sources and names of the selected metrics in the scene.
           For example, if the selected metrics are from three different
           hosts, then three copies of a tool may be launched, one for each
           host.  The behavior of a launch depends on the selected metrics
           and the tools being launched.

           On selection of a <b>Launch </b>menu item <b>pmview </b>generates state
           information in the <b>pmlaunch</b>(5) metrics specification format.
           This provides a description of the selected metrics (or if there
           are no selections, all the metrics) in the scene without any
           geometry information.

           Tools which can monitor multiple hosts and user specified metrics
           may be launched only once for those metrics (eg <a href="pmdumptext.1.html">pmdumptext(1)</a>).
           Other tools which have a fixed view for one host (eg <b>mpvis</b>(1)),
           may be launched multiple times, once for each host in the
           selected metric list.  If the launched tools have time controls,
           they will share the time controls with the launching <b>pmview</b>.

           The set of launched tools is configurable, and may include IRIX
           and user applications.  See <b>pmlaunch</b>(5) for more details.

       <b>Help/...</b>

       In addition to the menu options for time controls, the current
       direction of the time controls (see <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>) is shown in a button
       in the top-left corner of the <b>pmview </b>window.  Pressing this button
       will display the time control and is identical in behavior to
       <b>Options/Show Time Control</b>.

<h2><a id="SCALE_CONTROLS" href="#SCALE_CONTROLS"></a>SCALE CONTROLS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Above the examiner window is a thumb wheel and an editable text box
       which allow the user to apply a multiplier to all values represented
       in the scene.  Spinning the wheel to the right and/or increasing the
       text value for the scale will increase the height of the bars.
       Spinning the wheel to the left and/or lowering the text value will
       decrease the height of the bars.  The button to the right of the
       thumb wheel will reset the scale so that the bars appear at the
       original height for their current value.

       Beside the scale controls is another text box which displays the time
       of the fetched metrics.  The time will change with the time
       controller (see <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>).

       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to parameterize
       the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the
       file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these variables.
       The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to specify an alternative
