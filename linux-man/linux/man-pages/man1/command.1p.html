       The <i>command</i> utility shall cause the shell to treat the arguments as a
       simple command, suppressing the shell function lookup that is
       described in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>, <i>Command Search and Execution</i>, item 1b.

       If the <i>command_name</i> is the same as the name of one of the special
       built-in utilities, the special properties in the enumerated list at
       the beginning of <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i> shall not
       occur. In every other respect, if <i>command_name</i> is not the name of a
       function, the effect of <i>command</i> (with no options) shall be the same
       as omitting <i>command</i>.

       When the <b>−v </b>or <b>−V </b>option is used, the <i>command</i> utility shall provide
       information concerning how a command name is interpreted by the
       shell.

       The <i>command</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>−p        </b>Perform the command search using a default value for <i>PATH</i>
                 that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.

       <b>−v        </b>Write a string to standard output that indicates the
                 pathname or command that will be used by the shell, in the
                 current shell execution environment (see <i>Section 2.12</i>,
                 <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>), to invoke <i>command_name</i>, but
                 do not invoke <i>command_name</i>.

                  *  Utilities, regular built-in utilities, <i>command_name</i>s
                     including a &lt;slash&gt; character, and any implementation-
                     defined functions that are found using the <i>PATH</i>
                     variable (as described in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>, <i>Command</i>
                     <i>Search and Execution</i>), shall be written as absolute
                     pathnames.

                  *  Shell functions, special built-in utilities, regular
                     built-in utilities not associated with a <i>PATH</i> search,
                     and shell reserved words shall be written as just their
                     names.

                  *  An alias shall be written as a command line that
                     represents its alias definition.

                  *  Otherwise, no output shall be written and the exit
                     status shall reflect that the name was not found.

       <b>−V        </b>Write a string to standard output that indicates how the
                 name given in the <i>command_name</i> operand will be interpreted
                 by the shell, in the current shell execution environment
                 (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>), but do not
                 invoke <i>command_name</i>.  Although the format of this string is
                 unspecified, it shall indicate in which of the following
                 categories <i>command_name</i> falls and shall include the
                 information stated:

                  *  Utilities, regular built-in utilities, and any
                     implementation-defined functions that are found using
                     the <i>PATH</i> variable (as described in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>,
                     <i>Command Search and Execution</i>), shall be identified as
                     such and include the absolute pathname in the string.

                  *  Other shell functions shall be identified as functions.

                  *  Aliases shall be identified as aliases and their
                     definitions included in the string.

                  *  Special built-in utilities shall be identified as
                     special built-in utilities.

                  *  Regular built-in utilities not associated with a <i>PATH</i>
                     search shall be identified as regular built-in
                     utilities. (The term ``regular'' need not be used.)

       The order for command search allows functions to override regular
       built-ins and path searches. This utility is necessary to allow
       functions that have the same name as a utility to call the utility
       (instead of a recursive call to the function).

       The system default path is available using <i>getconf</i>; however, since
       <i>getconf</i> may need to have the <i>PATH</i> set up before it can be called
       itself, the following can be used:

           <b>command −p getconf PATH</b>

       There are some advantages to suppressing the special characteristics
       of special built-ins on occasion. For example:

           <b>command exec &gt; </b><i>unwritable-file</i>

       does not cause a non-interactive script to abort, so that the output
       status can be checked by the script.

       The <i>command</i>, <i>env</i>, <i>nohup</i>, <i>time</i>, and <i>xargs</i> utilities have been
       specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that
       applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from
       ``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value 127
       was chosen because it is not commonly used for other meanings; most
       utilities use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the
       values above 128 can be confused with termination due to receipt of a
       signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that
       the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce
       meaningful error messages differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The
       distinction between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell
       practice that uses 127 when all attempts to <i>exec</i> the utility fail
       with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and uses 126 when any attempt to <i>exec</i> the utility
       fails for any other reason.

       Since the <b>−v </b>and <b>−V </b>options of <i>command</i> produce output in relation to
       the current shell execution environment, <i>command</i> is generally
       provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell
       or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
       following:

           <b>(PATH=foo command −v)</b>
            <b>nohup command −v</b>

       it does not necessarily produce correct results. For example, when
       called with <i>nohup</i> or an <i>exec</i> function, in a separate utility
       execution environment, most implementations are not able to identify
       aliases, functions, or special built-ins.

       Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered on a system and
       these are described separately by <i>command</i>.  The description of
       command search in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>, <i>Command Search and Execution</i>
       allows for a standard utility to be implemented as a regular built-in
       as long as it is found in the appropriate place in a <i>PATH</i> search. So,
       for example, <i>command</i> <b>−v </b><i>true</i> might yield <b>/bin/true </b>or some similar
       pathname. Other implementation-defined utilities that are not defined
       by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 might exist only as built-ins and have
       no pathname associated with them. These produce output identified as
       (regular) built-ins. Applications encountering these are not able to
       count on <i>exec</i>ing them, using them with <i>nohup</i>, overriding them with a
       different <i>PATH</i>, and so on.

<h2><a id="EXAMPLES" href="#EXAMPLES"></a>EXAMPLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
        1. Make a version of <i>cd</i> that always prints out the new working
           directory exactly once:

               <b>cd() {</b>
                   <b>command cd "$@" &gt;/dev/null</b>
                   <b>pwd</b>
               <b>}</b>

        2. Start off a ``secure shell script'' in which the script avoids
           being spoofed by its parent:

               <b>IFS='</b>
               <b>'</b>
               <b>#    The preceding value should be &lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;.</b>
               <b>#    Set IFS to its default value.</b>

               \unalias −a
               #    Unset all possible aliases.
               #    Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
               #    being used for unalias.

               unset −f command
               #    Ensure command is not a user function.

               PATH="$(command −p getconf PATH):$PATH"
               #    Put on a reliable PATH prefix.

               #    ...

           At this point, given correct permissions on the directories
           called by <i>PATH</i>, the script has the ability to ensure that any
           utility it calls is the intended one. It is being very cautious
           because it assumes that implementation extensions may be present
           that would allow user functions to exist when it is invoked; this
           capability is not specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, but
           it is not prohibited as an extension. For example, the <i>ENV</i>
           variable precedes the invocation of the script with a user start-
           up script. Such a script could define functions to spoof the
           application.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RATIONALE" href="#RATIONALE"></a>RATIONALE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Since <i>command</i> is a regular built-in utility it is always found prior
       to the <i>PATH</i> search.

       There is nothing in the description of <i>command</i> that implies the
       command line is parsed any differently from that of any other simple
       command. For example:

           <b>command a | b ; c</b>

       is not parsed in any special way that causes <b>'|' </b>or <b>';' </b>to be treated
       other than a pipe operator or &lt;semicolon&gt; or that prevents function
       lookup on <b>b </b>or <b>c</b>.

       The <i>command</i> utility is somewhat similar to the Eighth Edition shell
       <i>builtin</i> command, but since <i>command</i> also goes to the file system to
       search for utilities, the name <i>builtin</i> would not be intuitive.

       The <i>command</i> utility is most likely to be provided as a regular built-
       in. It is not listed as a special built-in for the following reasons:

        *  The removal of exportable functions made the special precedence
           of a special built-in unnecessary.

        *  A special built-in has special properties (see <i>Section 2.14</i>,
           <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i>) that were inappropriate for invoking
           other utilities. For example, two commands such as:

               <b>date &gt; </b><i>unwritable-file</i>

               command date &gt; <i>unwritable-file</i>

           would have entirely different results; in a non-interactive
           script, the former would continue to execute the next command,
           the latter would abort. Introducing this semantic difference
           along with suppressing functions was seen to be non-intuitive.

       The <b>−p </b>option is present because it is useful to be able to ensure a
       safe path search that finds all the standard utilities. This search
       might not be identical to the one that occurs through one of the <i>exec</i>
       functions (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008) when <i>PATH</i> is unset. At the very least, this feature is
       required to allow the script to access the correct version of <i>getconf</i>
       so that the value of the default path can be accurately retrieved.

       The <i>command</i> <b>−v </b>and <b>−V </b>options were added to satisfy requirements from
       users that are currently accomplished by three different historical
       utilities: <i>type</i> in the System V shell, <i>whence</i> in the KornShell, and
       <i>which</i> in the C shell. Since there is no historical agreement on how
       and what to accomplish here, the POSIX <i>command</i> utility was enhanced
       and the historical utilities were left unmodified.  The C shell <i>which</i>
       merely conducts a path search. The KornShell <i>whence</i> is more
       elaborate—in addition to the categories required by POSIX, it also
       reports on tracked aliases, exported aliases, and undefined
       functions.

       The output format of <b>−V </b>was left mostly unspecified because human
       users are its only audience.  Applications should not be written to
       care about this information; they can use the output of <b>−v </b>to
       differentiate between various types of commands, but the additional
       information that may be emitted by the more verbose <b>−V </b>is not needed
       and should not be arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or
       localization for application parsing reasons.
