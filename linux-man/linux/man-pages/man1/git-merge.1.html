       Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
       histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch.
       This command is used by <i>git pull</i> to incorporate changes from another
       repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch
       into another.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
       "<b>master</b>":

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G master

       Then "<b>git merge topic</b>" will replay the changes made on the <b>topic</b>
       branch since it diverged from <b>master </b>(i.e., <b>E</b>) until its current
       commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master</b>, and record the result in a new commit
       along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from
       the user describing the changes.

                     A---B---C topic
                    /         \
               D---E---F---G---H master

       The second syntax ("<b>git merge --abort</b>") can only be run after the
       merge has resulted in conflicts. <i>git merge --abort</i> will abort the
       merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if
       there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially
       if those changes were further modified after the merge was started),
       <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the
       original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:

       <b>Warning</b>: Running <i>git merge</i> with non-trivial uncommitted changes is
       discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard
       to back out of in the case of a conflict.

       The fourth syntax ("<b>git merge --continue</b>") can only be run after the
       merge has resulted in conflicts.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       --commit, --no-commit
           Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used
           to override --no-commit.

           With --no-commit perform the merge but pretend the merge failed
           and do not autocommit, to give the user a chance to inspect and
           further tweak the merge result before committing.

       --edit, -e, --no-edit
           Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to
           further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user
           can explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit </b>option can be
           used to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally
           discouraged). The <b>--edit </b>(or <b>-e</b>) option is still useful if you
           are giving a draft message with the <b>-m </b>option from the command
           line and want to edit it in the editor.

           Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
           allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an
           editor opened when they run <b>git merge</b>. To make it easier to
           adjust such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment
           variable <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT </b>can be set to <b>no </b>at the beginning of
           them.

       --ff
           When the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch
           pointer, without creating a merge commit. This is the default
           behavior.

       --no-ff
           Create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a
           fast-forward. This is the default behaviour when merging an
           annotated (and possibly signed) tag.

       --ff-only
           Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the
           current <b>HEAD </b>is already up-to-date or the merge can be resolved
           as a fast-forward.

       --log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
           one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are
           being merged. See also <a href="git-fmt-merge-msg.1.html">git-fmt-merge-msg(1)</a>.

           With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual
           commits being merged.

       --stat, -n, --no-stat
           Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also
           controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.

           With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
           merge.

       --squash, --no-squash
           Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
           happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
           make a commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD </b>(to
           cause the next <b>git commit </b>command to create a merge commit). This
           allows you to create a single commit on top of the current branch
           whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in
           case of an octopus).

           With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
           option can be used to override --squash.

       -s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to
           specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no <b>-s</b>
           option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<i>git</i>
           <i>merge-recursive</i> when merging a single head, <i>git merge-octopus</i>
           otherwise).

       -X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
           strategy.

       --verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures
           Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is
           signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
           default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed
           by a trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not
           signed with a valid key, the merge is aborted.

       --summary, --no-summary
           Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will
           be removed in the future.

       -q, --quiet
           Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
           progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal.
           Note that not all merge strategies may support progress
           reporting.

       --allow-unrelated-histories
           By default, <b>git merge </b>command refuses to merge histories that do
           not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to override
           this safety when merging histories of two projects that started
           their lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no
           configuration variable to enable this by default exists and will
           not be added.

       -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]
           GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <b>keyid </b>argument is
           optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it
           must be stuck to the option without a space.

       -m &lt;msg&gt;
           Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case
           one is created).

           If <b>--log </b>is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged
           will be appended to the specified message.

           The <i>git fmt-merge-msg</i> command can be used to give a good default
           for automated <i>git merge</i> invocations. The automated message can
           include the branch description.

       --[no-]rerere-autoupdate
           Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the result of
           auto-conflict resolution if possible.

       --abort
           Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
           reconstruct the pre-merge state.

           If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
           started, <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to
           reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always
           commit or stash your changes before running <i>git merge</i>.

           <i>git merge --abort</i> is equivalent to <i>git reset --merge</i> when
           <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>is present.

       --continue
           After a <i>git merge</i> stops due to conflicts you can conclude the
           merge by running <i>git merge --continue</i> (see "HOW TO RESOLVE
           CONFLICTS" section below).

       &lt;commit&gt;...
           Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch.
           Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more
           than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).

           If no commit is given from the command line, merge the
           remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to
           use as its upstream. See also the configuration section of this
           manual page.

           When <b>FETCH_HEAD </b>(and no other commit) is specified, the branches
           recorded in the <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD </b>file by the previous invocation
           of <b>git fetch </b>for merging are merged to the current branch.

<h2><a id="PRE-MERGE_CHECKS" href="#PRE-MERGE_CHECKS"></a>PRE-MERGE CHECKS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good
       shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are
       conflicts. See also <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>. <i>git pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will stop
       without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with
       files that <i>git pull</i>/<i>git merge</i> may need to update.

       To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <i>git pull</i>
       and <i>git merge</i> will also abort if there are any changes registered in
       the index relative to the <b>HEAD </b>commit. (One exception is when the
       changed index entries are in the state that would result from the
       merge already.)

       If all named commits are already ancestors of <b>HEAD</b>, <i>git merge</i> will
       exit early with the message "Already up-to-date."
</pre>
<h2><a id="FAST-FORWARD_MERGE" href="#FAST-FORWARD_MERGE"></a>FAST-FORWARD MERGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
       This is the most common case especially when invoked from <i>git pull</i>:
       you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local
       changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In
       this case, a new commit is not needed to store the combined history;
       instead, the <b>HEAD </b>(along with the index) is updated to point at the
       named commit, without creating an extra merge commit.

       This behavior can be suppressed with the <b>--no-ff </b>option.
</pre>
<h2><a id="TRUE_MERGE" href="#TRUE_MERGE"></a>TRUE MERGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged
       must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its
       parents.

       A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
       merged is committed, and your <b>HEAD</b>, index, and working tree are
       updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working
       tree as long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.

       When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
       happens:

        1. The <b>HEAD </b>pointer stays the same.

        2. The <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>ref is set to point to the other branch head.

        3. Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and
           in your working tree.

        4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
           versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor,
           stage 2 from <b>HEAD</b>, and stage 3 from <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>(you can inspect
           the stages with <b>git ls-files -u</b>). The working tree files contain
           the result of the "merge" program; i.e. 3-way merge results with
           familiar conflict markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>.

        5. No other changes are made. In particular, the local modifications
           you had before you started merge will stay the same and the index
           entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <b>HEAD</b>.

       If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to
       start over, you can recover with <b>git merge --abort</b>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="MERGING_TAG" href="#MERGING_TAG"></a>MERGING TAG  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always
       creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and
       the commit message template is prepared with the tag message.
       Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported
       as a comment in the message template. See also <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>.

       When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit
       that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
       release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.

       In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it
       to <b>git merge</b>, or pass <b>--ff-only </b>when you do not have any work on your
       own. e.g.

           git fetch origin
           git merge v1.2.3^0
           git merge --ff-only v1.2.3
</pre>
<h2><a id="HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED" href="#HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED"></a>HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the
       result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor’s
       version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the
       file while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are
       incorporated in the final result verbatim. When both sides made
       changes to the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side
       over the other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides
       did to that area.

       By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge"
       program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted hunk, like
       this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with
       markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>=======</b>, and <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>. The part before the <b>======= </b>is
       typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.

       The default format does not show what the original said in the
       conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and
       replaced with Barbie’s remark on your side. The only thing you can
       tell is that your side wants to say it is hard and you’d prefer to go
       shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.

       An alternative style can be used by setting the "merge.conflictStyle"
       configuration variable to "diff3". In "diff3" style, the above
       conflict may look like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           |||||||
           Conflict resolution is hard.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       In addition to the <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>=======</b>, and <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>markers, it uses
       another <b>||||||| </b>marker that is followed by the original text. You can
       tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave
       in to that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have
       a more positive attitude. You can sometimes come up with a better

<h2><a id="HOW_TO_RESOLVE_CONFLICTS" href="#HOW_TO_RESOLVE_CONFLICTS"></a>HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:

       ·   Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need are to reset the
           index file to the <b>HEAD </b>commit to reverse 2. and to clean up
           working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <b>git merge --abort </b>can be
           used for this.

       ·   Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working
           tree. Edit the files into shape and <i>git add</i> them to the index.
           Use <i>git commit</i> to seal the deal.

       You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:

       ·   Use a mergetool.  <b>git mergetool </b>to launch a graphical mergetool
           which will work you through the merge.

       ·   Look at the diffs.  <b>git diff </b>will show a three-way diff,
           highlighting changes from both the <b>HEAD </b>and <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>versions.

       ·   Look at the diffs from each branch.  <b>git log --merge -p &lt;path&gt;</b>
           will show diffs first for the <b>HEAD </b>version and then the
           <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>version.

       ·   Look at the originals.  <b>git show :1:filename </b>shows the common
           ancestor, <b>git show :2:filename </b>shows the <b>HEAD </b>version, and <b>git</b>
           <b>show :3:filename </b>shows the <b>MERGE_HEAD </b>version.

       ·   Merge branches <b>fixes </b>and <b>enhancements </b>on top of the current
           branch, making an octopus merge:

               $ git merge fixes enhancements

       ·   Merge branch <b>obsolete </b>into the current branch, using <b>ours </b>merge
           strategy:

               $ git merge -s ours obsolete

       ·   Merge branch <b>maint </b>into the current branch, but do not make a new
           commit automatically:

               $ git merge --no-commit maint

           This can be used when you want to include further changes to the
           merge, or want to write your own merge commit message.

           You should refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial
           changes into a merge commit. Small fixups like bumping
           release/version name would be acceptable.

<h2><a id="MERGE_STRATEGIES" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES"></a>MERGE STRATEGIES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The merge mechanism (<b>git merge </b>and <b>git pull </b>commands) allows the
       backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with <b>-s </b>option. Some strategies
       can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving
       <b>-X&lt;option&gt; </b>arguments to <b>git merge </b>and/or <b>git pull</b>.

       resolve
           This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and
           another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It
           tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is
           considered generally safe and fast.

       recursive
           This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm.
           When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for
           3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and
           uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has
           been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing
           mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux
           2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and
           handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge
           strategy when pulling or merging one branch.

           The <i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following options:

           ours
               This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
               cleanly by favoring <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree
               that do not conflict with our side are reflected to the merge
               result. For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from
               our side.

               This should not be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy,
               which does not even look at what the other tree contains at
               all. It discards everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i>
               history contains all that happened in it.

           theirs
               This is the opposite of <i>ours</i>.

           patience
               With this option, <i>merge-recursive</i> spends a little extra time
               to avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
               matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use
               this when the branches to be merged have diverged wildly. See
               also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a><b>--patience</b>.

           diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
               Tells <i>merge-recursive</i> to use a different diff algorithm,
               which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant
               matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions). See
               also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a><b>--diff-algorithm</b>.

           ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol
               Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as
               unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace
               changes mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored.
               See also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a><b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, and <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>.

               ·   If <i>their</i> version only introduces whitespace changes to a
                   line, <i>our</i> version is used;

               ·   If <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace changes but <i>their</i>
                   version includes a substantial change, <i>their</i> version is
                   used;

               ·   Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

           renormalize
               This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
               stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This
               option is meant to be used when merging branches with
               different clean filters or end-of-line normalization rules.
               See "Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
               attributes" in <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

           no-renormalize
               Disables the <b>renormalize </b>option. This overrides the
               <b>merge.renormalize </b>configuration variable.

           no-renames
               Turn off rename detection. See also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a><b>--no-renames</b>.

           find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]
               Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity
               threshold. This is the default. See also
               <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a><b>--find-renames</b>.

           rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;
               Deprecated synonym for <b>find-renames=&lt;n&gt;</b>.

           subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]
               This option is a more advanced form of <i>subtree</i> strategy,
               where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be
               shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, the
               specified path is prefixed (or stripped from the beginning)
               to make the shape of two trees to match.

       octopus
           This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a
           complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant
           to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the
           default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one
           branch.

       ours
           This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the
           merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively
           ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be
           used to supersede old development history of side branches. Note
           that this is different from the -Xours option to the <i>recursive</i>
           merge strategy.

       subtree
           This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and
           B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
           match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at
           the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common
           ancestor tree.

       With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
       <i>recursive</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted
       on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged
       result; some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because
       only the heads and the merge base are considered when performing a
       merge, not the individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore
       considers the reverted change as no change at all, and substitutes
       the changed version instead.

<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION" href="#CONFIGURATION"></a>CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       merge.conflictStyle
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to
           working tree files upon merge. The default is "merge", which
           shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </b>conflict marker, changes made by one side, a
           <b>======= </b>marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
           <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>marker. An alternate style, "diff3", adds a <b>|||||||</b>
           marker and the original text before the <b>======= </b>marker.

       merge.defaultToUpstream
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
           upstream branches configured for the current branch by using
           their last observed values stored in their remote-tracking
           branches. The values of the <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge </b>that
           name the branches at the remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current</b>
           <b>branch&gt;.remote </b>are consulted, and then they are mapped via
           <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch </b>to their corresponding remote-tracking
           branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are merged.

       merge.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
           merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
           Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When
           set to <b>false</b>, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge
           commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff </b>option
           from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward
           merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the <b>--ff-only </b>option
           from the command line).

       merge.branchdesc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the
           branch description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

       merge.log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at
           most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the
           actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true
           is a synonym for 20.

       merge.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider when performing rename detection
           during a merge; if not specified, defaults to the value of
           diff.renameLimit.

       merge.renormalize
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository
           has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files
           with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In
           such a repository, Git can convert the data recorded in commits
           to a canonical form before performing a merge to reduce
           unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section "Merging
           branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes" in
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>.

       merge.stat
           Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge
           result at the end of the merge. True by default.

       merge.tool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a>. The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated
           as a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

           conflicts were detected. Level 1 outputs only conflicts, 2
           outputs conflicts and file changes. Level 5 and above outputs
           debugging information. The default is level 2. Can be overridden
           by the <b>GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY </b>environment variable.
