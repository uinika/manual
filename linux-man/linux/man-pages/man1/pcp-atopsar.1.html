       The <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program can be used to report statistics at the
       system level.

       In the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified), <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>atopsar </b>extracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded
       previously by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> (or via the <b>-w </b>option of the <b>pcp-atop</b>
       program).
       You can specify the name of the logfile with the <b>-r </b>option of the
       <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program.  When a <b>pmlogger </b>daily logfile is used, named
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/[host]/YYYYMMDD </b>(where YYYYMMDD reflects the
       date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD can be specified with
       the <b>-r </b>option instead of the filename, or the symbolic name 'y' can
       be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this can be repeated so 'yyyy'
       indicates the logfile of four days ago).  If the <b>-r </b>option is not
       specified at all, today's daily logfile is used by default.
       By default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when resolving
       <b>pmlogger </b>archives, however an alternative <i>host</i> can be specified using
       the <b>-h </b>option.
       The starting and ending times of the report can be defined using the
       options <b>-b </b>and <b>-e </b>followed by a time argument of the form hh:mm.

       In the second synopsis line, <b>pcp-atopsar </b>reads actual activity
       counters from the kernel with the specified <i>interval</i> (in seconds) and
       the specified number of <i>samples</i> (optionally).  When <b>pcp-atopsar </b>is
       activated in this way it immediately sends the output for every
       requested report to standard output.  If only one type of report is
       requested, the header is printed once and after every <i>interval</i>
       seconds the statistical counters are shown for that period.  If
       several reports are requested, a header is printed per sample
       followed by the statistical counters for that period.

       When invoked via the <a href="pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <a href="PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> options
       <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>, <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>,
       <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and several other <i>pcp options</i> become indirectly
       available.

       Some generic flags can be specified to influence the behaviour of the
       <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program:

       <b>-S   </b>By default the timestamp at the beginning of a line is
            suppressed if more lines are shown for one interval. With this
            flag a timestamp is given for every output-line (easier for
            post-processing).

       <b>-a   </b>By default certain resources as disks and network interfaces are
            only shown when they were active during the interval.  With this
            flag all resources of a given type are shown, even if they were
            inactive during the interval.

       <b>-x   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is directed to
            a terminal (window).  These colors might indicate that a
            critical occupation percentage has been reached (red) or has
            been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.  See the
            man-page of <b>atop </b>for a detailed description of this feature
            (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-x </b>the use of colors is suppressed
            unconditionally.

       <b>-C   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is directed to
            a terminal (window).  These colors might indicate that a
            critical occupation percentage has been reached (red) or has
            been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.  See the
            man-page of <b>atop </b>for a detailed description of this feature
            (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-C </b>colors will always be used, even if output is
            not directed to a terminal.

       <b>-M   </b>Use markers at the end of a line to indicate that a critical
            occupation percentage has been reached ('*') or has been almost
            reached ('+') for particular resources. The marker '*' is
            similar to the color red and the marker '+' to the color cyan.
            See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a detailed description of these
            colors (section COLORS).

       <b>-H   </b>Repeat the header line within a report for every <i>N</i> detail lines.
            The value of <i>N</i> is determined dynamically in case of output to a
            tty/window (depending on the number of lines); for output to a
            file or pipe this value is 23.

       <b>-R   </b>Summarize <i>cnt</i> samples into one sample. When the logfile contains
            e.g. samples of 10 minutes, the use of the flag '-R 6' shows a
            report with one sample for every hour.

       Other flags are used to define which reports are required:

       <b>-A   </b>Show all possible reports.

       <b>-c   </b>Report about CPU utilization (in total and per cpu).

       Depending on the requested report, a number of columns with output
       values are produced.  The values are mostly presented as a number of
       events per second.

       The output for the flag <b>-c </b>contains the following columns per cpu:

       <b>usr%        </b>Percentage of cpu-time consumed in user mode (program
                   text) for all active processes running with a nice value
                   of zero (default) or a negative nice value (which means a
                   higher priority than usual).  The cpu consumption in user
                   mode of processes with a nice value larger than zero
                   (lower priority) is indicated in the nice%-column.

       <b>nice%       </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (i.e.
                   program text) for all processes running witn a nice value
                   larger than zero (which means with a lower priority than
                   average).

       <b>sys%        </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed in system mode (kernel
                   text) for all active processes. A high percentage usually
                   indicates a lot of system calls being issued.

       <b>irq%        </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed for handling of device
                   interrupts.

       <b>softirq%    </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed for soft interrupt
                   handling.

       <b>steal%      </b>Percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines
                   running on the same hardware.

                   running on the same hardware (overlaps with usr%/nice%).

       <b>wait%       </b>Percentage of unused cpu time while at least one of the
                   processes in wait-state awaits completion of disk I/O.

                   cpu) enters a wait state or has used its time slice
                   completely; another thread will then be chosen to use the
                   cpu.

       <b>devintr/s   </b>Number of hardware interrupts handled per second on this
                   cpu.

                   this unit (seek, latency and data-transfer).

       The output for the flag <b>-n </b>contains information about activity on NFS
       mounted filesystems (client):

       host acme.com):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/acme.com/20120605 -b 10:00</b>
       <b>-e 12:30</b>

                       or

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r 20120605 -b 10:00 -e 12:30</b>

                       or, suppose it is June 8, 2012 at this moment

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r yyy -b 10:00 -e 12:30</b>

       Write a logfile with <b>atop </b>to record the system behaviour for 30
       minutes (30 samples of one minute) and produce all available reports
       afterwards:

         <b>pcp-atop -w /tmp/atoplog 60 30</b>

         <b>pcp-atopsar -A -r /tmp/atoplog</b>

       To watch TCP activity evolve for ten minutes (10 samples with sixty
       seconds interval):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -t 60 10</b>

       To watch the header-lines ('_' as last character) of all reports with
       only the detail-lines showing critical resource consumption (marker
       '*' or '+' as last character):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -AM | grep '[_*+]$'</b>
