       <b>ps </b>displays information about a selection of the active processes.
       If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
       information, use <a href="top.1.html">top(1)</a> instead.

       This version of <b>ps </b>accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a
           dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a
           dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
       appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally
       identical, due to the many standards and <b>ps </b>implementations that this
       <b>ps </b>is compatible with.

       Note that "<b>ps -aux</b>" is distinct from "<b>ps aux</b>".  The POSIX and UNIX
       standards require that "<b>ps -aux</b>" print all processes owned by a user
       named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected
       by the <b>-a </b>option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this <b>ps </b>may
       interpret the command as "<b>ps aux</b>" instead and print a warning.  This
       behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.
       It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, <b>ps </b>selects all processes with the same effective user ID
       (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal
       as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal
       associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in
       [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).
       Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to
       the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead
       of the executable name.  You can override this with the <b>PS_FORMAT</b>
       environment variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change
       the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs)
       that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting
       the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude
       processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects
       are not considered when options are described as being "identical"
       below, so <b>-M </b>will be considered identical to <b>Z </b>and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.
       The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes
       are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will
       thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

       <b>a      </b>Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is
              imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
              (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps </b>personality
              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this
              manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by
              other means.  An alternate description is that this option
              causes <b>ps </b>to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to
              list all processes when used together with the <b>x </b>option.

       <b>-A     </b>Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-a     </b>Select all processes except both session leaders (see
              <a href="../man2/getsid.2.html">getsid(2)</a>) and processes not associated with a terminal.

       <b>-d     </b>Select all processes except session leaders.

       <b>--deselect</b>
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to <b>-N</b>.

       <b>-e     </b>Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-A</b>.

       <b>g      </b>Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and
              may be discontinued in a future release.  It is normally
              implied by the <b>a </b>flag, and is only useful when operating in
              the sunos4 personality.

       <b>-N     </b>Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified
              conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to <b>--deselect</b>.

       <b>T      </b>Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical
              to the <b>t </b>option without any argument.

       <b>r      </b>Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       <b>x      </b>Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is
              imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
              (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps </b>personality
              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this
              manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by

              causes <b>ps </b>to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as
              <b>ps</b>), or to list all processes when used together with the <b>a</b>

       These options accept a single argument in the form of a
       blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple
       times.  For example: <b>ps -p "1 2" -p 3,4</b>

       -<i>123</i>   Identical to <b>--pid </b><i>123</i>.

       <i>123</i>    Identical to <b>--pid </b><i>123</i>.

       <b>-C </b><i>cmdlist</i>
              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose
              executable name is given in <i>cmdlist</i>.

       <b>-G </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose real group name or ID is in the <i>grplist</i> list.
              The real group ID identifies the group of the user who created
              the process, see <a href="../man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a>.

       <b>-g </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by
              session is specified by many standards, but selection by
              effective group is the logical behavior that several other
              operating systems use.  This <b>ps </b>will select by session when
              the list is completely numeric (as sessions are).  Group ID
              numbers will work only when some group names are also
              specified.  See the <b>-s </b>and <b>--group </b>options.

       <b>--Group </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to <b>-G</b>.

       <b>--group </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective group name or ID is in <i>grplist</i>.  The
              effective group ID describes the group whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see <a href="../man2/getegid.2.html">getegid(2)</a>).  The <b>-g</b>
              option is often an alternative to <b>--group</b>.

       <b>p </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p </b>and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>-p </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID
              numbers appear in <i>pidlist</i>.  Identical to <b>p </b>and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>--pid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p </b>and <b>p</b>.

       <b>--ppid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with
              a parent process ID in <i>pidlist</i>.  That is, it selects processes
              that are children of those listed in <i>pidlist</i>.

       <b>q </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q </b>and
              <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>-q </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose
              process ID numbers appear in <i>pidlist</i>.  With this option <b>ps</b>
              reads the necessary info only for the pids listed in the
              <i>pidlist</i> and doesn't apply additional filtering rules. The
              order of pids is unsorted and preserved. No additional
              selection options, sorting and forest type listings are
              allowed in this mode.  Identical to <b>q </b>and <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>--quick-pid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q </b>and <b>q</b>.

       <b>-s </b><i>sesslist</i>
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a
              session ID specified in <i>sesslist</i>.

       <b>--sid </b><i>sesslist</i>
              Select by session ID.  Identical to <b>-s</b>.

       <b>t </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to <b>-t </b>and <b>--tty</b>, but can also
              be used with an empty <i>ttylist</i> to indicate the terminal
              associated with <b>ps</b>.  Using the <b>T </b>option is considered cleaner
              than using <b>t </b>with an empty <i>ttylist</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the
              terminals given in <i>ttylist</i>.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for
              text output) can be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1,
              ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select processes not
              attached to any terminal.

       <b>--tty </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by terminal.  Identical to <b>-t </b>and <b>t</b>.

       <b>U </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in <i>userlist</i>.  The
              effective user ID describes the user whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see <i>geteuid</i>(2)).
              Identical to <b>-u </b>and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>-U </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the
              processes whose real user name or ID is in the <i>userlist</i> list.
              The real user ID identifies the user who created the process,
              see <a href="../man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a>.

       <b>-u </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose effective user name or ID is in <i>userlist</i>.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
              permissions are used by the process (see <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a>).
              Identical to <b>U </b>and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>--User </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to <b>-U</b>.

       <b>--user </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to <b>-u</b>
              and <b>U</b>.

       These options are used to choose the information displayed by <b>ps</b>.
       The output may differ by personality.

       <b>-c     </b>Show different scheduler information for the <b>-l </b>option.

       <b>--context</b>
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       <b>-f     </b>Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many
              other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also
              causes the command arguments to be printed.  When used with
              <b>-L</b>, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns
              will be added.  See the <b>c </b>option, the format keyword <b>args</b>, and
              the format keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>-F     </b>Extra full format.  See the <b>-f </b>option, which <b>-F </b>implies.

       <b>--format </b><i>format</i>
              user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o </b>and <b>o</b>.

       <b>j      </b>BSD job control format.

       <b>-j     </b>Jobs format.

       <b>l      </b>Display BSD long format.

       <b>-l     </b>Long format.  The <b>-y </b>option is often useful with this.

       <b>-M     </b>Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>Z </b>(for SELinux).

       <b>O </b><i>format</i>
              is preloaded <b>o </b>(overloaded).  The BSD <b>O </b>option can act like <b>-O</b>
              (user-defined output format with some common fields
              predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics
              are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure
              that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
              specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with <b>-O </b>or
              <b>--sort</b>).  When used as a formatting option, it is identical to
              <b>-O</b>, with the BSD personality.

       <b>-O </b><i>format</i>
              Like <b>-o</b>, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical
              to <b>-o pid,</b><i>format</i><b>,state,tname,time,command </b>or <b>-o pid,</b><i>format</i><b>,</b>
              <b>tname,time,cmd</b>, see <b>-o </b>below.

       <b>o </b><i>format</i>
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o </b>and <b>--format</b>.

       <b>-o </b><i>format</i>
              User-defined format.  <i>format</i> is a single argument in the form
              of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a
              way to specify individual output columns.  The recognized
              keywords are described in the <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS</b>
              section below.  Headers may be renamed (<b>ps -o pid,</b>
              <b>ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command</b>) as desired.  If all column
              headers are empty (<b>ps -o pid= -o comm=</b>) then the header line
              will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for
              wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as
              WCHAN (<b>ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm</b>).  Explicit
              width control (<b>ps opid,wchan:42,cmd</b>) is offered too.  The
              behavior of <b>ps -o pid=X,comm=Y </b>varies with personality; output
              may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X"
              and "Y".  Use multiple <b>-o </b>options when in doubt.  Use the
              <b>PS_FORMAT </b>environment variable to specify a default as
              desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to
              choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.

       <b>s      </b>Display signal format.

       <b>u      </b>Display user-oriented format.

       <b>v      </b>Display virtual memory format.

       <b>X      </b>Register format.

       <b>-y     </b>Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can
              only be used with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>Z      </b>Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>-M </b>(for SELinux).

       <b>c      </b>Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of
              the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command
              arguments and any modifications to them are thus not shown.
              This option effectively turns the <b>args </b>format keyword into the
              <b>comm </b>format keyword; it is useful with the <b>-f </b>format option
              and with the various BSD-style format options, which all
              normally display the command arguments.  See the <b>-f </b>option,
              the format keyword <b>args</b>, and the format keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>--cols </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--columns </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--cumulative</b>
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the
              parent).

       <b>e      </b>Show the environment after the command.

       <b>f      </b>ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--forest</b>
              ASCII art process tree.

       <b>h      </b>No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD
              personality).  The <b>h </b>option is problematic.  Standard BSD <b>ps</b>
              uses this option to print a header on each page of output, but
              older Linux <b>ps </b>uses this option to totally disable the header.
              This version of <b>ps </b>follows the Linux usage of not printing the
              header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which
              case it prints a header on each page of output.  Regardless of
              the current personality, you can use the long options
              <b>--headers </b>and <b>--no-headers </b>to enable printing headers each
              page or disable headers entirely, respectively.

       <b>-H     </b>Show process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--headers</b>
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       <b>k </b><i>spec</i> Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS </b>section.  The "+" is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic
              order.  Identical to <b>--sort</b>.

                      Examples:
                      <b>ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid</b>
                      <b>ps axk comm o comm,args</b>
                      <b>ps kstart_time -ef</b>

       <b>--lines </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen height.

       <b>n      </b>Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID
              and GID).

       <b>--no-headers</b>
              Print no header line at all.  <b>--no-heading </b>is an alias for
              this option.

       <b>O </b><i>order</i>
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD <b>O </b>option can act like <b>-O</b>
              (user-defined output format with some common fields
              predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.  Heuristics
              are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure
              that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
              specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with <b>-O </b>or
              <b>--sort</b>).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD <b>O </b>option syntax is
              <b>O</b>[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>k1</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>k2</i>[,...]].  It orders the processes listing
              according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of
              one-letter short keys <i>k1</i>,<i>k2</i>, ...  described in the <b>OBSOLETE</b>
              <b>SORT KEYS </b>section below.  The "+" is currently optional,
              merely re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may
              help to distinguish an <b>O </b>sort from an <b>O </b>format.  The "-"
              reverses direction only on the key it precedes.

       <b>--rows </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen height.

       <b>S      </b>Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child
              processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a
              system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived
              children to do work.

       <b>--sort </b><i>spec</i>
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
              <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS </b>section.  The "+" is optional since
              default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic
              order.  Identical to <b>k</b>.  For example: <b>ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,</b>
              <b>+pid</b>

       <b>w      </b>Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>-w     </b>Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>--width </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.

       This <b>ps </b>works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This <b>ps </b>does
       not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not
       give this <b>ps </b>any special permissions.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent
       running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal,
       and it does not conform to the standards that <b>ps </b>otherwise conforms
       to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including
       the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct
       task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is
       always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+
       stack).

       Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called "zombies")
       that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.
       These processes will be destroyed by <b>init</b>(8) if the parent process
       exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the
       display column, the username will be truncated. See the -o and -O
       formatting options to customize length.

       Commands options such as <b>ps -aux </b>are not recommended as it is a
       confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and
       UNIX standards, the above command asks to display all processes with
       a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all processes
       owned by a user named "x".  If that user doesn't exist, then <b>ps </b>will
       assume you really meant "<b>ps </b><i>aux</i>".

       Here are the different values that the <b>s</b>, <b>stat </b>and <b>state </b>output
       specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state
       of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by
                    its parent

       For BSD formats and when the <b>stat </b>keyword is used, additional
       characters may be displayed:

               &lt;    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom
                    IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL
                    pthreads do)

       These keys are used by the BSD <b>O </b>option (when it is used for

       Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values <b>ps </b>uses
       and not the "cooked" values used in some of the output format fields
       (e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device number, not according to

       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the
       output format (e.g. with option <b>-o</b>) or to sort the selected processes
       with the GNU-style <b>--sort </b>option.

       For example: <b>ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user</b>

       This version of <b>ps </b>tries to recognize most of the keywords used in
       other implementations of <b>ps</b>.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces:
       <b>args</b>, <b>cmd</b>, <b>comm</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>fname</b>, <b>ucmd</b>, <b>ucomm</b>,
       <b>lstart</b>, <b>bsdstart</b>, <b>start</b>.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       <b>CODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION</b>

       <b>%cpu        </b>%CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#"
                             format.  Currently, it is the CPU time used
                             divided by the time the process has been
                             running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as
                             a percentage.  It will not add up to 100%
                             unless you are lucky.  (alias <b>pcpu</b>).

       <b>%mem        </b>%MEM      ratio of the process's resident set size  to
                             the physical memory on the machine, expressed
                             as a percentage.  (alias <b>pmem</b>).

       <b>args        </b>COMMAND   command with all its arguments as a string.
                             Modifications to the arguments may be shown.
                             The output in this column may contain spaces.
                             A process marked &lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead,
                             waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
                             Sometimes the process args will be unavailable;
                             when this happens, <b>ps </b>will instead print the
                             executable name in brackets.  (alias
                             <b>cmd</b>, <b>command</b>).  See also the <b>comm </b>format
                             keyword, the <b>-f </b>option, and the <b>c </b>option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to
                             the edge of the display.  If <b>ps </b>can not
                             determine display width, as when output is
                             redirected (piped) into a file or another
                             command, the output width is undefined (it may

                             variable, and so on).  The <b>COLUMNS </b>environment
                             variable or <b>--cols </b>option may be used to

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The following environment variables could affect <b>ps</b>:

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
          Override default display width.

       <b>LINES</b>
          Override default display height.

       <b>PS_PERSONALITY</b>
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...  (see
          section <b>PERSONALITY </b>below).

       <b>CMD_ENV</b>
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital...  (see
          section <b>PERSONALITY </b>below).

       <b>I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS</b>
          Force obsolete command line interpretation.

       <b>LC_TIME</b>
          Date format.

       <b>PS_COLORS</b>
          Not currently supported.

       <b>PS_FORMAT</b>
          Default output format override. You may set this to a format
          string of the type used for the <b>-o </b>option.  The <b>DefSysV </b>and <b>DefBSD</b>
          values are particularly useful.

       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       <b>POSIX2</b>
          When set to "on", acts as <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>.

       <b>UNIX95</b>
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       <b>_XPG</b>
          Cancel <b>CMD_ENV</b>=<i>irix</i> non-standard behavior.

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables.  The one
       exception is <b>CMD_ENV </b>or <b>PS_PERSONALITY</b>, which could be set to Linux
       for normal systems.  Without that setting, <b>ps </b>follows the useless and
       bad parts of the Unix98 standard.

       <b>ps </b>was originally written by Branko Lankester ⟨lankeste@fwi.uva.nl⟩.
       Michael K. Johnson ⟨johnsonm@redhat.com⟩ re-wrote it significantly to
       use the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.
       Michael Shields ⟨mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu⟩ added the pid-list feature.
       Charles Blake ⟨cblake@bbn.com⟩ added multi-level sorting, the
       dirent-style library, the device name-to-number mmaped database, the
       approximate binary search directly on System.map, and many code and
       documentation cleanups.  David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD
       support for psupdate.  Albert Cahalan ⟨albert@users.sf.net⟩ rewrote
       ps for full Unix98 and BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for
       obsolete and foreign syntax.
