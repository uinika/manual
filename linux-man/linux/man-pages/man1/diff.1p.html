       The <i>diff</i> utility shall compare the contents of <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> and
       write to standard output a list of changes necessary to convert <i>file1</i>
       into <i>file2</i>.  This list should be minimal. No output shall be produced
       if the files are identical.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>diff</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>−b        </b>Cause any amount of white space at the end of a line to be
                 treated as a single &lt;newline&gt; (that is, the white-space
                 characters preceding the &lt;newline&gt; are ignored) and other
                 strings of white-space characters, not including &lt;newline&gt;
                 characters, to compare equal.

       <b>−c        </b>Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                 copied context.

       <b>−C </b><i>n</i>      Produce output in a form that provides <i>n</i> lines of copied
                 context (where <i>n</i> shall be interpreted as a positive decimal
                 integer).

       <b>−e        </b>Produce output in a form suitable as input for the <i>ed</i>
                 utility, which can then be used to convert <i>file1</i> into
                 <i>file2</i>.

       <b>−f        </b>Produce output in an alternative form, similar in format to
                 <b>−e</b>, but not intended to be suitable as input for the <i>ed</i>
                 utility, and in the opposite order.

       <b>−r        </b>Apply <i>diff</i> recursively to files and directories of the same
                 name when <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are both directories.

                 The <i>diff</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
                 entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor
                 of the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite
                 loop, <i>diff</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
                 error and shall either recover its position in the
                 hierarchy or terminate.

       <b>−u        </b>Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                 unified context.

       <b>−U </b><i>n</i>      Produce output in a form that provides <i>n</i> lines of unified
                 context (where <i>n</i> shall be interpreted as a non-negative
                 decimal integer).

       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i>
                 A pathname of a file to be compared. If either the <i>file1</i> or
                 <i>file2</i> operand is <b>'−'</b>, the standard input shall be used in
                 its place.

       If both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are directories, <i>diff</i> shall not compare block
       special files, character special files, or FIFO special files to any
       files and shall not compare regular files to directories.  Further
       details are as specified in <i>Diff Directory Comparison Format</i>.  The
       behavior of <i>diff</i> on other file types is implementation-defined when
       found in directories.

       If only one of <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> is a directory, <i>diff</i> shall be applied
       to the non-directory file and the file contained in the directory
       file with a filename that is the same as the last component of the
       non-directory file.

       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>diff</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, <i>Section 8.2</i>, <i>Internationalization</i>
                 <i>Variables</i> for the precedence of internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale
                 categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
                 as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input
                 files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to standard
                 output.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the locale for affecting the format of file
                 timestamps written with the <b>−C </b>and <b>−c </b>options.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone used for calculating file timestamps
                 written with a context format. If <i>TZ</i> is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default timezone shall be used.

   <b>Diff Directory Comparison Format</b>
       If both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are directories, the following output formats
       shall be used.

       In the POSIX locale, each file that is present in only one directory
       shall be reported using the following format:

           <b>"Only in %s: %s\n", &lt;</b><i>directory pathname</i><b>&gt;, &lt;</b><i>filename</i>&gt;

       In the POSIX locale, subdirectories that are common to the two
       directories may be reported with the following format:

           <b>"Common subdirectories: %s and %s\n", &lt;</b><i>directory1 pathname</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>directory2 pathname</i>&gt;

       For each file common to the two directories, if the two files are not
       to be compared: if the two files have the same device ID and file
       serial number, or are both block special files that refer to the same
       device, or are both character special files that refer to the same
       device, in the POSIX locale the output format is unspecified.
       Otherwise, in the POSIX locale an unspecified format shall be used
       that contains the pathnames of the two files.

       For each file common to the two directories, if the files are
       compared and are identical, no output shall be written. If the two
       files differ, the following format is written:

           <b>"diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;</b><i>diff_options</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename2</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>diff_options</i>&gt; are the options as specified on the command
       line.

       All directory pathnames listed in this section shall be relative to
       the original command line arguments. All other names of files listed
       in this section shall be filenames (pathname components).

   <b>Diff Binary Output Format</b>
       In the POSIX locale, if one or both of the files being compared are
       not text files, it is implementation-defined whether <i>diff</i> uses the
       binary file output format or the other formats as specified below.
       The binary file output format shall contain the pathnames of two
       files being compared and the string <b>"differ"</b>.

       If both files being compared are text files, depending on the options
       specified, one of the following formats shall be used to write the
       differences.

   <b>Diff Default Output Format</b>
       The default (without <b>−e</b>, <b>−f</b>, <b>−c</b>, <b>−C</b>, <b>−u</b>, or <b>−U </b>options) <i>diff</i> utility
       output shall contain lines of these forms:

           <b>"%da%d\n", &lt;</b><i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%da%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dd%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dd%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dc%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num4</i>&gt;

       These lines resemble <i>ed</i> subcommands to convert <i>file1</i> into <i>file2</i>.  The
       line numbers before the action letters shall pertain to <i>file1</i>; those
       after shall pertain to <i>file2</i>.  Thus, by exchanging <i>a</i> for <i>d</i> and
       reading the line in reverse order, one can also determine how to
       convert <i>file2</i> into <i>file1</i>.  As in <i>ed</i>, identical pairs (where <i>num1</i>=
       <i>num2</i>) are abbreviated as a single number.

       Following each of these lines, <i>diff</i> shall write to standard output
       all lines affected in the first file using the format:

           <b>"&lt; %s", &lt;</b><i>line</i>&gt;

       and all lines affected in the second file using the format:

           <b>"&gt; %s", &lt;</b><i>line</i>&gt;

       If there are lines affected in both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> (as with the <b>c</b>
       subcommand), the changes are separated with a line consisting of
       three &lt;hyphen&gt; characters:

           <b>"−−−\n"</b>

   <b>Diff −e Output Format</b>
       With the <b>−e </b>option, a script shall be produced that shall, when
       provided as input to <i>ed</i>, along with an appended <b>w </b>(write) command,
       convert <i>file1</i> into <i>file2</i>.  Only the <b>a </b>(append), <b>c </b>(change), <b>d</b>
       (delete), <b>i </b>(insert), and <b>s </b>(substitute) commands of <i>ed</i> shall be used
       in this script. Text lines, except those consisting of the single
       character &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>), shall be output as they appear in the file.

   <b>Diff −f Output Format</b>
       With the <b>−f </b>option, an alternative format of script shall be
       produced. It is similar to that produced by <b>−e</b>, with the following
       differences:

        1. It is expressed in reverse sequence; the output of <b>−e </b>orders
           changes from the end of the file to the beginning; the <b>−f </b>from
           beginning to end.

        2. The command form &lt;<i>lines</i>&gt; &lt;<i>command-letter</i>&gt; used by <b>−e </b>is reversed.
           For example, 10<i>c</i> with <b>−e </b>would be <i>c</i>10 with <b>−f</b>.

        3. The form used for ranges of line numbers is &lt;space&gt;-separated,
           rather than &lt;comma&gt;-separated.

   <b>Diff −c or −C Output Format</b>
       With the <b>−c </b>or <b>−C </b>option, the output format shall consist of affected
       lines along with surrounding lines of context. The affected lines
       shall show which ones need to be deleted or changed in <i>file1</i>, and
       those added from <i>file2</i>.  With the <b>−c </b>option, three lines of context,
       if available, shall be written before and after the affected lines.
       With the <b>−C </b>option, the user can specify how many lines of context
       are written.  The exact format follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output in
       the following format:

           <b>"*** %s %s\n", </b><i>file1</i>, &lt;<i>file1 timestamp</i>&gt;
           "−−− %s %s\n", <i>file2</i>, &lt;<i>file2 timestamp</i>&gt;

       Each &lt;<i>file</i>&gt; field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
       being compared. The pathname written for standard input is
       unspecified.

       In the POSIX locale, each &lt;<i>timestamp</i>&gt; field shall be equivalent to
       the output from the following command:

           <b>date "+%a %b %e %T %Y"</b>

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last
       modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if the
       file is standard input).

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set of
       changes.

       First, a line shall be written in the following format:

           <b>"***************\n"</b>

       Next, the range of lines in <i>file1</i> shall be written in the following
       format if the range contains two or more lines:

           <b>"*** %d,%d ****\n", &lt;</b><i>beginning line number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           <b>"*** %d ****\n", &lt;</b><i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       The ending line number of an empty range shall be the number of the
       preceding line, or 0 if the range is at the start of the file.

       Next, the affected lines along with lines of context (unaffected
       lines) shall be written. Unaffected lines shall be written in the
       following format:

           <b>"  %s", &lt;</b><i>unaffected_line</i>&gt;

       Deleted lines shall be written as:

           <b>"− %s", &lt;</b><i>deleted_line</i>&gt;

       Changed lines shall be written as:

           <b>"! %s", &lt;</b><i>changed_line</i>&gt;

       Next, the range of lines in <i>file2</i> shall be written in the following
       format if the range contains two or more lines:

           <b>"−−− %d,%d −−−−\n", &lt;</b><i>beginning line number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           <b>"−−− %d −−−−\n", &lt;</b><i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       Then, lines of context and changed lines shall be written as
       described in the previous formats. Lines added from <i>file2</i> shall be
       written in the following format:

           <b>"+ %s", &lt;</b><i>added_line</i>&gt;

   <b>Diff −u or −U Output Format</b>
       The <b>−u </b>or <b>−U </b>options behave like the <b>−c </b>or <b>−C </b>options, except that
       the context lines are not repeated; instead, the context, deleted,
       and added lines are shown together, interleaved.  The exact format
       follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output in
       the following format:

           <b>"--- %s%s%s %s0, file1, &lt;file1 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file1 frac&gt;, &lt;file1 zone&gt;</b>
           <b>"+++ %s%s%s %s0, file2, &lt;file2 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file2 frac&gt;, &lt;file2 zone&gt;</b>

       Each &lt;<i>file</i>&gt; field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
       being compared, or the single character <b>'−' </b>if standard input is
       being compared. However, if the pathname contains a &lt;tab&gt; or a
       &lt;newline&gt;, or if it does not consist entirely of characters taken
       from the portable character set, the behavior is implementation-
       defined.

       Each &lt;<i>timestamp</i>&gt; field shall be equivalent to the output from the
       following command:

           <b>date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'</b>

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last
       modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if the
       file is standard input).

       Each &lt;<i>frac</i>&gt; field shall be either empty, or a decimal point followed
       by at least one decimal digit, indicating the fractional-seconds part
       (if any) of the file timestamp. The number of fractional digits shall
       be at least the number needed to represent the file's timestamp
       without loss of information.

       Each &lt;<i>zone</i>&gt; field shall be of the form <b>"shhmm"</b>, where <b>"shh" </b>is a
       signed two-digit decimal number in the range −24 through +25, and
       <b>"mm" </b>is an unsigned two-digit decimal number in the range 00 through
       59.  It represents the timezone of the timestamp as the number of
       hours (hh) and minutes (mm) east (+) or west (−) of UTC for the
       timestamp.  If the hours and minutes are both zero, the sign shall be
       <b>'+'</b>.  However, if the timezone is not an integral number of minutes
       away from UTC, the &lt;<i>zone</i>&gt; field is implementation-defined.

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set of
       changes.

       First, the range of lines in each file shall be written in the
       following format:

           <b>"@@ -%s +%s @@", &lt;file1 range&gt;, &lt;file2 range&gt;</b>

       Each &lt;<i>range</i>&gt; field shall be of the form:

           <b>"%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;</b>

       if the range contains exactly one line, and:

           <b>"%1d,%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;, &lt;number of lines&gt;</b>

       otherwise. If a range is empty, its beginning line number shall be
       the number of the line just before the range, or 0 if the empty range
       starts the file.

       Next, the affected lines along with lines of context shall be
       written.  Each non-empty unaffected line shall be written in the
       following format:

           <b>" %s", &lt;unaffected_line&gt;</b>

       where the contents of the unaffected line shall be taken from <i>file1</i>.
       It is implementation-defined whether an empty unaffected line is
       written as an empty line or a line containing a single &lt;space&gt;
       character. This line also represents the same line of <i>file2</i>, even
       though <i>file2</i>'s line may contain different contents due to the <b>−b</b>.
       Deleted lines shall be written as:

           <b>"-%s", &lt;deleted_line&gt;</b>

       Added lines shall be written as:

           <b>"+%s", &lt;added_line&gt;</b>

       The order of lines written shall be the same as that of the
       corresponding file. A deleted line shall never be written immediately
       after an added line.

       If <b>−U </b><i>n</i> is specified, the output shall contain no more than <i>n</i>
       consecutive unaffected lines; and if the output contains an affected
       line and this line is adjacent to up to <i>n</i> consecutive unaffected
       lines in the corresponding file, the output shall contain these
       unaffected lines.  <b>−u </b>shall act like <b>−U</b>3.

       The <b>−h </b>option was omitted because it was insufficiently specified and
       does not add to applications portability.

       Historical implementations employ algorithms that do not always
       produce a minimum list of differences; the current language about
       making every effort is the best this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 can do,
       as there is no metric that could be employed to judge the quality of
       implementations against any and all file contents. The statement
       ``This list should be minimal'' clearly implies that implementations
       are not expected to provide the following output when comparing two
       100-line files that differ in only one character on a single line:

           <b>1,100c1,100</b>
           <b>all 100 lines from file1 preceded with "&lt; "</b>
           <b>−−−</b>
           <b>all 100 lines from file2 preceded with "&gt; "</b>

       The ``Only in'' messages required when the <b>−r </b>option is specified are
       not used by most historical implementations if the <b>−e </b>option is also
       specified. It is required here because it provides useful information
       that must be provided to update a target directory hierarchy to match
       a source hierarchy. The ``Common subdirectories'' messages are
       written by System V and 4.3 BSD when the <b>−r </b>option is specified. They
       are allowed here but are not required because they are reporting on
       something that is the same, not reporting a difference, and are not
       needed to update a target hierarchy.

       The <b>−c </b>option, which writes output in a format using lines of
       context, has been included. The format is useful for a variety of
       reasons, among them being much improved readability and the ability
       to understand difference changes when the target file has line
       numbers that differ from another similar, but slightly different,
       copy. The <i>patch</i> utility is most valuable when working with difference
       listings using a context format. The BSD version of <b>−c </b>takes an
       optional argument specifying the amount of context. Rather than
       overloading <b>−c </b>and breaking the Utility Syntax Guidelines for <i>diff</i>,
       the standard developers decided to add a separate option for
       specifying a context diff with a specified amount of context (<b>−C</b>).
       Also, the format for context <i>diff</i>s was extended slightly in 4.3 BSD
       to allow multiple changes that are within context lines from each
       other to be merged together. The output format contains an additional
       four &lt;asterisk&gt; characters after the range of affected lines in the
       first filename. This was to provide a flag for old programs (like old
       versions of <i>patch</i>) that only understand the old context format. The
       version of context described here does not require that multiple
       changes within context lines be merged, but it does not prohibit it
       either. The extension is upwards-compatible, so any vendors that wish
       to retain the old version of <i>diff</i> can do so by adding the extra four
       &lt;asterisk&gt; characters (that is, utilities that currently use <i>diff</i> and
       understand the new merged format will also understand the old
       unmerged format, but not <i>vice versa</i>).

       The <b>−u </b>and <b>−U </b>options of GNU <i>diff</i> have been included. Their output
       format, designed by Wayne Davison, takes up less space than <b>−c </b>and <b>−C</b>
       format, and in many cases is easier to read. The format's timestamps
       do not vary by locale, so <i>LC_TIME</i> does not affect it. The format's
       line numbers are rendered with the <b>%1d </b>format, not <b>%d</b>, because the
       file format notation rules would allow extra &lt;blank&gt; characters to
       appear around the numbers.

       The substitute command was added as an additional format for the <b>−e</b>
       option. This was added to provide implementations with a way to fix
       the classic ``dot alone on a line'' bug present in many versions of
       <i>diff</i>.  Since many implementations have fixed this bug, the standard
       developers decided not to standardize broken behavior, but rather to
       provide the necessary tool for fixing the bug. One way to fix this
       bug is to output two periods whenever a lone period is needed, then
       terminate the append command with a period, and then use the
       substitute command to convert the two periods into one period.

       The BSD-derived <b>−r </b>option was added to provide a mechanism for using
       <i>diff</i> to compare two file system trees. This behavior is useful, is
       standard practice on all BSD-derived systems, and is not easily
       reproducible with the <i>find</i> utility.

       The requirement that <i>diff</i> not compare files in some circumstances,
       even though they have the same name, is based on the actual output of
       historical implementations.  The specified behavior precludes the
       problems arising from running into FIFOs and other files that would
       cause <i>diff</i> to hang waiting for input with no indication to the user
       that <i>diff</i> was hung. An earlier version of this standard specified the
       output format more precisely, but in practice this requirement was
       widely ignored and the benefit of standardization seemed small, so it
       is now unspecified. In most common usage, <i>diff</i> <b>−r </b>should indicate
       differences in the file hierarchies, not the difference of contents
       of devices pointed to by the hierarchies.

       Many early implementations of <i>diff</i> require seekable files. Since the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 supports named pipes, the
       standard developers decided that such a restriction was unreasonable.
       Note also that the allowed filename <b>− </b>almost always refers to a pipe.

       No directory search order is specified for <i>diff</i>.  The historical
       ordering is, in fact, not optimal, in that it prints out all of the
       differences at the current level, including the statements about all
       common subdirectories before recursing into those subdirectories.

       The message:

           <b>"diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;</b><i>diff_options</i><b>&gt;, &lt;</b><i>filename1</i><b>&gt;, &lt;</b><i>filename2</i><b>&gt;</b>

       does not vary by locale because it is the representation of a
       command, not an English sentence.
