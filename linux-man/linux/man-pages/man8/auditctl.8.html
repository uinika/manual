<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>auditctl </b>program is used to configure kernel options related to
       auditing, to see status of the configuration, and to load
       discretionary audit rules.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS" href="#CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS"></a>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-b </b><i>backlog</i>
              Set max number of outstanding audit buffers allowed (Kernel
              Default=64) If all buffers are full, the failure flag is
              consulted by the kernel for action.

       <b>--backlog_wait_time </b><i>wait_time</i>
              Set the time for the kernel to wait (Kernel Default 60*HZ)
              when the backlog_limit is reached before queuing more audit
              events to be transferred to auditd. The number must be greater
              than or equal to zero and less that 10 times the default
              value.

       <b>-c     </b>Continue loading rules in spite of an error. This summarizes
              the results of loading the rules. The exit code will not be
              success if any rule fails to load.

       <b>-D     </b>Delete all rules and watches. This can take a key option (-k),
              too.

       <b>-e </b>[<b>0</b>..<b>2</b>]
              Set enabled flag. When <b>0 </b>is passed, this can be used to
              temporarily disable auditing. When <b>1 </b>is passed as an argument,
              it will enable auditing. To lock the audit configuration so
              that it can't be changed, pass a <b>2 </b>as the argument. Locking
              the configuration is intended to be the last command in
              audit.rules for anyone wishing this feature to be active. Any
              attempt to change the configuration in this mode will be
              audited and denied. The configuration can only be changed by
              rebooting the machine.

       <b>-f </b>[<b>0</b>..<b>2</b>]
              Set failure mode <b>0</b>=silent <b>1</b>=printk <b>2</b>=panic. This option lets
              you determine how you want the kernel to handle critical
              errors. Example conditions where this mode may have an effect
              includes: transmission errors to userspace audit daemon,
              backlog limit exceeded, out of kernel memory, and rate limit
              exceeded. The default value is <b>1</b>. Secure environments will
              probably want to set this to <b>2</b>.

       <b>-h     </b>Help

       <b>-i     </b>When given by itself, ignore errors when reading rules from a
              file. This causes auditctl to always return a success exit
              code. If passed as an argument to <b>-s </b>then it gives an
              interpretation of the numbers to human readable words if
              possible.

       <b>--loginuid-immutable</b>
              This option tells the kernel to make loginuids unchangeable
              once they are set. Changing loginuids requires
              CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. So, its not something that can be done by
              unprivileged users. Setting this makes loginuid tamper-proof,
              but can cause some problems in certain kinds of containers.

       <b>-q </b><i>mount-point,subtree</i>
              If you have an existing directory watch and bind or move mount
              another subtree in the watched subtree, you need to tell the
              kernel to make the subtree being mounted equivalent to the
              directory being watched. If the subtree is already mounted at
              the time the directory watch is issued, the subtree is
              automatically tagged for watching. Please note the comma
              separating the two values. Omitting it will cause errors.

       <b>-r </b><i>rate</i>
              Set limit in messages/sec (<b>0</b>=none). If this <i>rate</i> is non-zero
              and is exceeded, the failure flag is consulted by the kernel
              for action. The default value is <b>0</b>.

       <b>--reset-lost</b>
              Reset the lost record counter shown by the status command.

       <b>-R </b><i>file</i>
              Read rules from a <i>file</i>. The rules must be 1 per line and in
              the order that they are to be executed in. The rule file must
              be owned by root and not readable by other users or it will be
              rejected. The rule file may have comments embedded by starting
              the line with a '#' character. Rules that are read from a file
              are identical to what you would type on a command line except
              they are not preceded by auditctl (since auditctl is the one
              executing the file) and you would not use shell escaping since
              auditctl is reading the file instead of bash.

       <b>-t     </b>Trim the subtrees after a mount command.
</pre>
<h2><a id="STATUS_OPTIONS" href="#STATUS_OPTIONS"></a>STATUS OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-l     </b>List all rules 1 per line. Two more options may be given to
              this command. You can give either a key option (-k) to list
              rules that match a key or a (-i) to have a0 through a3
              interpreted to help determine the syscall argument values are
              correct .

       <b>-m </b><i>text</i>
              Send a user space message into the audit system. This can only
              be done if you have CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability (normally the
              root user has this). The resulting event will be the USER
              type.

       <b>-s     </b>Report the kernel's audit subsystem status. It will tell you
              the in-kernel values that can be set by <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-r</b>, and <b>-b</b>
              options. The pid value is the process number of the audit
              daemon. Note that a pid of 0 indicates that the audit daemon
              is not running. The lost entry will tell you how many event
              records that have been discarded due to the kernel audit queue
              overflowing. The backlog field tells how many event records
              are currently queued waiting for auditd to read them. This
              option can be followed by the <b>-i </b>to get a couple fields
              interpreted.

       <b>-v     </b>Print the version of auditctl.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RULE_OPTIONS" href="#RULE_OPTIONS"></a>RULE OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-a </b><i>[</i><b>list,action</b><i>|</i><b>action,list</b><i>]</i>
              Append rule to the end of <i>list</i> with <i>action</i>. Please note the
              comma separating the two values. Omitting it will cause
              errors. The fields may be in either order. It could be
              list,action or action,list. The following describes the valid
              <i>list</i> names:

              <b>task        </b>Add a rule to the per task list. This rule list is
                          used only at the time a task is created -- when
                          fork() or clone() are called by the parent task.
                          When using this list, you should only use fields
                          that are known at task creation time, such as the
                          uid, gid, etc.

              <b>exit        </b>Add a rule to the syscall exit list. This list is
                          used upon exit from a system call to determine if
                          an audit event should be created.

              <b>user        </b>Add a rule to the user message filter list. This
                          list is used by the kernel to filter events
                          originating in user space before relaying them to
                          the audit daemon. It should be noted that the only
                          fields that are valid are: uid, auid, gid, pid,
                          subj_user, subj_role, subj_type, subj_sen,
                          subj_clr, and msgtype. All other fields will be
                          treated as non-matching. It should be understood
                          that any event originating from user space from a
                          process that has CAP_AUDIT_WRITE will be recorded
                          into the audit trail. This means that the most
                          likely use for this filter is with rules that have
                          an action of never since nothing has to be done to
                          allow events to be recorded.

              <b>exclude     </b>Add a rule to the event type exclusion filter
                          list. This list is used to filter events that you
                          do not want to see. For example, if you do not
                          want to see any avc messages, you would using this
                          list to record that. Events can be excluded by
                          process ID, user ID, group ID, login user ID,
                          message type or subject context

       The following describes the valid <i>actions</i> for the rule:

              <b>never       </b>No audit records will be generated. This can be
                          used to suppress event generation. In general, you
                          want suppressions at the top of the list instead
                          of the bottom. This is because the event triggers
                          on the first matching rule.

              <b>always      </b>Allocate an audit context, always fill it in at
                          syscall entry time, and always write out a record
                          at syscall exit time.

       <b>-A </b><i>list</i><b>,</b><i>action</i>
              Add rule to the beginning <i>list</i> with <i>action</i>.

       <b>-C </b>[<i>f</i><b>=</b><i>f</i> | <i>f</i><b>!=</b><i>f</i>]
              Build an inter-field comparison rule: field, operation, field.
              You may pass multiple comparisons on a single command line.
              Each one must start with <b>-C</b>. Each inter-field equation is
              anded with each other as well as equations starting with <b>-F </b>to
              trigger an audit record. There are 2 operators supported -
              equal, and not equal. Valid fields are:

              <b>auid, uid, euid, suid, fsuid, obj_uid; and gid, egid, sgid,</b>
              <b>fsgid, obj_gid</b>

              The two groups of uid and gid cannot be mixed. But any
              comparison within the group can be made. The obj_uid/gid
              fields are collected from the object of the event such as a
              file or directory.

       <b>-d </b><i>list</i><b>,</b><i>action</i>
              Delete rule from <i>list</i> with <i>action</i>. The rule is deleted only if
              it exactly matches syscall name(s) and every field name and
              value.

       <b>-F </b>[<i>n</i><b>=</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>!=</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&lt;</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&gt;</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&lt;=</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&gt;=</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&amp;</b><i>v</i> | <i>n</i><b>&amp;=</b><i>v</i>]
              Build a rule field: name, operation, value. You may have up to
              64 fields passed on a single command line. Each one must start
              with <b>-F</b>. Each field equation is anded with each other (as well
              as equations starting with <b>-C</b>) to trigger an audit record.
              There are 8 operators supported - equal, not equal, less than,
              greater than, less than or equal, and greater than or equal,
              bit mask, and bit test respectively. Bit test will "and" the
              values and check that they are equal, bit mask just "ands" the
              values. Fields that take a user ID may instead have the user's
              name; the program will convert the name to user ID. The same
              is true of group names. Valid fields are:

              <b>a0, a1, a2, a3</b>
                          Respectively, the first 4 arguments to a syscall.
                          Note that string arguments are not supported. This
                          is because the kernel is passed a pointer to the
                          string. Triggering on a pointer address value is
                          not likely to work. So, when using this, you
                          should only use on numeric values. This is most
                          likely to be used on platforms that multiplex
                          socket or IPC operations.

              <b>arch        </b>The CPU architecture of the syscall. The arch can
                          be found doing 'uname -m'. If you do not know the
                          arch of your machine but you want to use the 32
                          bit syscall table and your machine supports 32
                          bit, you can also use <b>b32 </b>for the arch. The same
                          applies to the 64 bit syscall table, you can use
                          <b>b64.  </b>In this way, you can write rules that are
                          somewhat arch independent because the family type
                          will be auto detected. However, syscalls can be
                          arch specific and what is available on x86_64, may
                          not be available on ppc. The arch directive should
                          precede the -S option so that auditctl knows which
                          internal table to use to look up the syscall
                          numbers.

              <b>auid        </b>The original ID the user logged in with. Its an
                          abbreviation of audit uid. Sometimes its referred
                          to as loginuid. Either the user account text or
                          number may be used.

              <b>devmajor    </b>Device Major Number

              <b>devminor    </b>Device Minor Number

              <b>dir         </b>Full Path of Directory to watch. This will place a
                          recursive watch on the directory and its whole
                          subtree. It can only be used on exit list. See
                          "<b>-w</b>".

              <b>egid        </b>Effective Group ID. May be numeric or the groups
                          name.

              <b>euid        </b>Effective User ID. May be numeric or the user
                          account name.

              <b>exe         </b>Absolute path to application that while executing
                          this rule will apply to. This can only be used on
                          the exit list.

       <b>-k </b><i>key</i> Set a filter key on an audit rule. The filter key is an
              arbitrary string of text that can be up to 31 bytes long. It
              can uniquely identify the audit records produced by a rule.
              Typical use is for when you have several rules that together
              satisfy a security requirement. The key value can be searched
              on with ausearch so that no matter which rule triggered the
              event, you can find its results. The key can also be used on
              delete all (-D) and list rules (-l) to select rules with a
              specific key. You may have more than one key on a rule if you
              want to be able to search logged events in multiple ways or if
              you have an audispd plugin that uses a key to aid its
              analysis.

       <b>-p </b>[<b>r</b>|<b>w</b>|<b>x</b>|<b>a</b>]
              Describe the permission access type that a file system watch
              will trigger on. <b>r</b>=read, <b>w</b>=write, <b>x</b>=execute, <b>a</b>=attribute
              change. These permissions are not the standard file
              permissions, but rather the kind of syscall that would do this
              kind of thing. The read &amp; write syscalls are omitted from this
              set since they would overwhelm the logs. But rather for reads
              or writes, the open flags are looked at to see what permission
              was requested.

       <b>-S </b>[<i>Syscall name or number</i>|<b>all</b>]
              Any <i>syscall name</i> or <i>number</i> may be used. The word '<b>all</b>' may
              also be used.  If the given syscall is made by a program, then
              start an audit record. If a field rule is given and no syscall
              is specified, it will default to all syscalls. You may also
              specify multiple syscalls in the same rule by using multiple
              -S options in the same rule. Doing so improves performance
              since fewer rules need to be evaluated. Alternatively, you may
              pass a comma separated list of syscall names. If you are on a
              bi-arch system, like x86_64, you should be aware that auditctl
              simply takes the text, looks it up for the native arch (in
              this case b64) and sends that rule to the kernel. If there are
              no additional arch directives, IT WILL APPLY TO BOTH 32 &amp; 64
              BIT SYSCALLS. This can have undesirable effects since there is
              no guarantee that any syscall has the same number on both 32
              and 64 bit interfaces. You will likely want to control this
              and write 2 rules, one with arch equal to b32 and one with b64
              to make sure the kernel finds the events that you intend. See
              the arch field discussion for more info.

       <b>-w </b><i>path</i>
              Insert a watch for the file system object at <i>path</i>. You cannot
              insert a watch to the top level directory. This is prohibited
              by the kernel. Wildcards are not supported either and will
              generate a warning. The way that watches work is by tracking
              the inode internally. If you place a watch on a file, its the
              same as using the -F path option on a syscall rule. If you
              place a watch on a directory, its the same as using the -F dir
              option on a syscall rule. The -w form of writing watches is
              for backwards compatibility and the syscall based form is more
              expressive. Unlike most syscall auditing rules, watches do not
              impact performance based on the number of rules sent to the
              kernel. The only valid options when using a watch are the -p
              and -k. If you need to anything fancy like audit a specific
              user accessing a file, then use the syscall auditing form with
              the path or dir fields. See the EXAMPLES section for an
              example of converting one form to another.

       <b>-W </b><i>path</i>
              Remove a watch for the file system object at <i>path</i>. The rule
              must match exactly. See <b>-d </b>discussion for more info.

<h2><a id="PERFORMANCE_TIPS" href="#PERFORMANCE_TIPS"></a>PERFORMANCE TIPS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Syscall rules get evaluated for each syscall for every program. If
       you have 10 syscall rules, every program on your system will delay
       during a syscall while the audit system evaluates each rule. Too many
       syscall rules will hurt performance. Try to combine as many as you
       can whenever the filter, action, key, and fields are identical. For
       example:

       <b>auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -F success=0</b>
       <b>auditctl -a always,exit -S truncate -F success=0</b>

       could be re-written as one rule:

       <b>auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -S truncate -F success=0</b>

       Also, try to use file system auditing wherever practical. This
       improves performance. For example, if you were wanting to capture all
       failed opens &amp; truncates like above, but were only concerned about
       files in /etc and didn't care about /usr or /sbin, its possible to
       use this rule:

       <b>auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -S truncate -F dir=/etc -F success=0</b>

       This will be higher performance since the kernel will not evaluate it
       each and every syscall. It will be handled by the filesystem auditing
       code and only checked on filesystem related syscalls.
