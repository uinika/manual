       <b>xfs_quota </b>is a utility for reporting and editing various aspects of
       filesystem quota.

       The options to <b>xfs_quota </b>are:

       <b>-c </b><i>cmd</i>    <b>xfs_quota </b>commands may be run interactively (the default)
                 or as arguments on the command line. Multiple <b>-c </b>arguments
                 may be given.  The commands are run in the sequence given,
                 then the program exits.

       <b>-p </b><i>prog</i>   Set the program name for prompts and some error messages,
                 the default value is <b>xfs_quota</b>.

       <b>-x        </b>Enable expert mode.  All of the administrative commands
                 (see the ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS section below) which allow
                 modifications to the quota system are available only in
                 expert mode.

       <b>-f        </b>Enable foreign filesystem mode.  A limited number of user
                 and administrative commands are available for use on some
                 foreign (non-XFS) filesystems.

       <b>-d </b><i>project</i>
                 Project names or numeric identifiers may be specified with
                 this option, which restricts the output of the individual
                 <b>xfs_quota </b>commands to the set of projects specified.
                 Multiple <b>-d </b>arguments may be given.

       <b>-D </b><i>projects_file</i>
                 Specify a file containing the mapping of numeric project
                 identifiers to directory trees.  <i>/etc/projects</i> as default,
                 if this option is none.

       <b>-P </b><i>projid_file</i>
                 Specify a file containing the mapping of numeric project
                 identifiers to project names.  <i>/etc/projid</i> as default, if
                 this option is none.

       <b>-V        </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       The optional <i>path</i> argument(s) can be used to specify mount points or
       device files which identify XFS filesystems. The output of the
       individual <b>xfs_quota </b>commands will then be restricted to the set of
       filesystems specified.

       This manual page is divided into two sections - firstly, information
       for users of filesystems with quota enabled, and the <b>xfs_quota</b>
       commands of interest to such users; and then information which is
       useful only to administrators of XFS filesystems using quota and the
       quota commands which allow modifications to the quota system.

       Note that common to almost all of the individual commands described
       below are the options for specifying which quota types are of
       interest - user quota (<b>-u</b>), group quota (<b>-g</b>), and/or project quota
       (<b>-p</b>).  Also, several commands provide options to operate on "blocks
       used" (<b>-b</b>), "inodes used" (<b>-i</b>), and/or "realtime blocks used" (<b>-r</b>).

       Many commands also have extensive online help. Use the <b>help </b>command
       for more details on any command.

<h2><a id="QUOTA_OVERVIEW" href="#QUOTA_OVERVIEW"></a>QUOTA OVERVIEW  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       In most computing environments, disk space is not infinite.  The
       quota subsystem provides a mechanism to control usage of disk space.
       Quotas can be set for each individual user on any/all of the local
       filesystems.  The quota subsystem warns users when they exceed their
       allotted limit, but allows some extra space for current work (hard
       limit/soft limit).  In addition, XFS filesystems with limit
       enforcement turned off can be used as an effective disk usage
       accounting system.

   <b>Users' View of Disk Quotas</b>
       To most users, disk quotas are either of no concern or a fact of life
       that cannot be avoided.  There are two possible quotas that can be
       imposed - a limit can be set on the amount of space a user can
       occupy, and there may be a limit on the number of files (inodes) he
       can own.

       The <b>quota </b>command provides information on the quotas that have been
       set by the system administrators and current usage.

       There are four numbers for each limit:  current usage, soft limit
       (quota), hard limit, and time limit.  The soft limit is the number of
       1K-blocks (or files) that the user is expected to remain below.  The
       hard limit cannot be exceeded.  If a user's usage reaches the hard
       limit, further requests for space (or attempts to create a file) fail
       with the "Quota exceeded" (EDQUOT) error.

       When a user exceeds the soft limit, the timer is enabled.  Any time
       the quota drops below the soft limits, the timer is disabled.  If the
       timer pops, the particular limit that has been exceeded is treated as
       if the hard limit has been reached, and no more resources are
       allocated to the user.  The only way to reset this condition, short
       of turning off limit enforcement or increasing the limit, is to
       reduce usage below quota.  Only the superuser (i.e. a sufficiently
       capable process) can set the time limits and this is done on a per
       filesystem basis.

   <b>Surviving When the Quota Limit Is Reached</b>
       In most cases, the only way for a user to recover from over-quota
       conditions is to abort whatever activity is in progress on the
       filesystem that has reached its limit, remove sufficient files to
       bring the limit back below quota, and retry the failed program.
       However, if a user is in the editor and a write fails because of an
       over quota situation, that is not a suitable course of action.  It is
       most likely that initially attempting to write the file has truncated
       its previous contents, so if the editor is aborted without correctly
       writing the file, not only are the recent changes lost, but possibly
       much, or even all, of the contents that previously existed.
       There are several possible safe exits for a user caught in this
       situation.  He can use the editor shell escape command to examine his
       file space and remove surplus files.  Alternatively, using <b>sh</b>(1), he
       can suspend the editor, remove some files, then resume it.  A third
       possibility is to write the file to some other filesystem (perhaps to
       a file on <i>/tmp</i>) where the user's quota has not been exceeded.  Then
       after rectifying the quota situation, the file can be moved back to
       the filesystem it belongs on.

       <b>print  </b>Lists all paths with devices/project identifiers.  The path
              list can come from several places - the command line, the
              mount table, and the <i>/etc/projects</i> file.

       <b>df     </b>See the <b>free </b>command.

       <b>quota </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-bir </b>] [ <b>-hnNv </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ] [ <i>ID</i> | <i>name</i> ]

              Show individual usage and limits, for a single user <i>name</i> or
              numeric user <i>ID</i>.  The <b>-h </b>option reports in a "human-readable"
              format similar to the <a href="../man1/df.1.html">df(1)</a> command. The <b>-n </b>option reports the
              numeric IDs rather than the name. The <b>-N </b>option omits the
              header. The <b>-v </b>option outputs verbose information. The <b>-f</b>
              option sends the output to <i>file</i> instead of stdout.

       <b>free </b>[ <b>-bir </b>] [ <b>-hN </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Reports filesystem usage, much like the <a href="../man1/df.1.html">df(1)</a> utility.  It can
              show usage for <b>b</b>locks, <b>i</b>node, and/or <b>r</b>ealtime block space, and
              shows used, free, and total available.  If project quota are
              in use (see the DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA section below), it will
              also report utilisation for those projects (directory trees).
              The <b>-h </b>option reports in a "human-readable" format. The <b>-N</b>
              option omits the header. The <b>-f </b>option outputs the report to
              <i>file</i> instead of stdout.

<h2><a id="QUOTA_ADMINISTRATION" href="#QUOTA_ADMINISTRATION"></a>QUOTA ADMINISTRATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The XFS quota system differs to that of other filesystems in a number
       of ways.  Most importantly, XFS considers quota information as
       filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide a higher level
       guarantee of consistency.  As such, it is administered differently,
       in particular:

       1.     The <b>quotacheck </b>command has no effect on XFS filesystems.  The
              first time quota accounting is turned on (at mount time), XFS
              does an automatic quotacheck internally; afterwards, the quota
              system will always be completely consistent until quotas are
              manually turned off.

       2.     There is no need for quota file(s) in the root of the XFS
              filesystem.

       3.     XFS distinguishes between quota accounting and limit
              enforcement.  Quota accounting must be turned on at the time
              of mounting the XFS filesystem.  However, it is possible to
              turn on/off limit enforcement any time quota accounting is
              turned on.  The "quota" option to the <b>mount </b>command turns on
              both (user) quota accounting and enforcement.  The
              "uqnoenforce" option must be used to turn on user accounting
              with limit enforcement disabled.

       4.     Turning on quotas on the root filesystem is slightly different
              from the above.  For IRIX XFS, refer to <b>quotaon</b>(1M).  For
              Linux XFS, the quota mount flags must be passed in with the
              "rootflags=" boot parameter.

       5.     It is useful to use the <b>state </b>to monitor the XFS quota
              subsystem at various stages - it can be used to see if quotas
              are turned on, and also to monitor the space occupied by the
              quota system itself..

       6.     There is a mechanism built into <b>xfsdump </b>that allows quota
              limit information to be backed up for later restoration,
              should the need arise.

       7.     Quota limits cannot be set before turning on quotas on.

       8.     XFS filesystems keep quota accounting on the superuser (user
              ID zero), and the tool will display the superuser's usage
              information.  However, limits are never enforced on the
              superuser (nor are they enforced for group and project ID
              zero).

       9.     XFS filesystems perform quota accounting whether the user has
              quota limits or not.

       10.    XFS supports the notion of project quota, which can be used to
              implement a form of directory tree quota (i.e. to restrict a
              directory tree to only being able to use up a component of the
              filesystems available space; or simply to keep track of the
              amount of space used, or number of inodes, within the tree).

       <b>path </b>[ <i>N</i> ]
              Lists all paths with devices/project identifiers or set the
              current path to the <i>N</i>th list entry (the current path is used
              by many of the commands described here, it identifies the
              filesystem toward which a command is directed).  The path list
              can come from several places - the command line, the mount
              table, and the <i>/etc/projects</i> file.

       <b>report </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-bir </b>] [ <b>-ahntlLNU </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Report filesystem quota information.  This reports all quota
              usage for a filesystem, for the specified quota type (<b>u</b>/<b>g</b>/<b>p</b>
              and/or <b>b</b>locks/<b>i</b>nodes/<b>r</b>ealtime).  It reports blocks in 1KB
              units by default. The <b>-h </b>option reports in a "human-readable"
              format similar to the <a href="../man1/df.1.html">df(1)</a> command. The <b>-f </b>option outputs the
              report to <i>file</i> instead of stdout. The <b>-a </b>option reports on all
              filesystems. By default, outputs the name of the
              user/group/project. If no name is defined for a given ID,
              outputs the numeric ID instead. The <b>-n </b>option outputs the
              numeric ID instead of the name. The <b>-L </b>and <b>-U </b>options specify
              lower and upper ID bounds to report on.  If upper/lower bounds
              are specified, then by default only the IDs will be displayed
              in output; with the <b>-l </b>option, a lookup will be performed to
              translate these IDs to names. The <b>-N </b>option reports
              information without the header line. The <b>-t </b>option performs a
              terse report.

       <b>state </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-av </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Report overall quota state information.  This reports on the
              state of quota accounting, quota enforcement, and the number
              of extents being used by quota metadata within the filesystem.
              The <b>-f </b>option outputs state information to <i>file</i> instead of
              stdout. The <b>-a </b>option reports state on all filesystems and not
              just the current path.

       <b>limit </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] <b>bsoft=</b><i>N</i> | <b>bhard=</b><i>N</i> | <b>isoft=</b><i>N</i> | <b>ihard=</b><i>N</i> |
              <b>rtbsoft=</b><i>N</i> | <b>rtbhard=</b><i>N</i> <b>-d </b>| <i>id</i> | <i>name</i>
              Set quota block limits (bhard/bsoft), inode count limits
              (ihard/isoft) and/or realtime block limits (rtbhard/rtbsoft).
              The <b>-d </b>option (defaults) can be used to set the default value
              that will be used, otherwise a specific <b>u</b>ser/<b>g</b>roup/<b>p</b>roject
              <i>name</i> or numeric <i>id</i>entifier must be specified.

       <b>timer </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-bir </b>] <i>value</i>
              Allows the quota enforcement timeout (i.e. the amount of time
              allowed to pass before the soft limits are enforced as the
              hard limits) to be modified. The current timeout setting can
              be displayed using the <b>state </b>command. The value argument is a
              number of seconds, but units of 'minutes', 'hours', 'days',
              and 'weeks' are also understood (as are their abbreviations
              'm', 'h', 'd', and 'w').

       <b>warn </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-bir </b>] <i>value</i> <b>-d </b>| <i>id</i> | <i>name</i>
              Allows the quota warnings limit (i.e. the number of times a
              warning will be send to someone over quota) to be viewed and
              modified. The <b>-d </b>option (defaults) can be used to set the
              default time that will be used, otherwise a specific
              <b>u</b>ser/<b>g</b>roup/<b>p</b>roject <i>name</i> or numeric <i>id</i>entifier must be
              specified.  <b>NOTE: this feature is not currently implemented.</b>

       <b>enable </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-v </b>]
              Switches on quota enforcement for the filesystem identified by
              the current path.  This requires the filesystem to have been
              mounted with quota enabled, and for accounting to be currently
              active. The <b>-v </b>option (verbose) displays the state after the
              operation has completed.

       <b>disable </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-v </b>]
              Disables quota enforcement, while leaving quota accounting
              active. The <b>-v </b>option (verbose) displays the state after the
              operation has completed.

       <b>off </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-v </b>]
              Permanently switches quota off for the filesystem identified
              by the current path.  Quota can only be switched back on
              subsequently by unmounting and then mounting again.

       <b>remove </b>[ <b>-gpu </b>] [ <b>-v </b>]
              Remove any space allocated to quota metadata from the
              filesystem identified by the current path.  Quota must not be
              enabled on the filesystem, else this operation will report an
              error.

       <b>dump </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Dump out quota limit information for backup utilities, either
              to standard output (default) or to a <i>file</i>.  This is only the
              limits, not the usage information, of course.

       <b>restore </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Restore quota limits from a backup <i>file</i>.  The file must be in
              the format produced by the <b>dump </b>command.

       <b>quot </b>[ <b>-g </b>| <b>-p </b>| <b>-u </b>] [ <b>-bir </b>] [ <b>-acnv </b>] [ <b>-f </b><i>file</i> ]
              Summarize filesystem ownership, by user, group or project.
              This command uses a special XFS "bulkstat" interface to
              quickly scan an entire filesystem and report usage
              information.  This command can be used even when filesystem
              quota are not enabled, as it is a full-filesystem scan (it may
              also take a long time...). The <b>-a </b>option displays information
              on all filesystems. The <b>-c </b>option displays a histogram instead
              of a report. The <b>-n </b>option displays numeric IDs rather than
              names. The <b>-v </b>option displays verbose information. The <b>-f</b>
              option send the output to <i>file</i> instead of stdout.

       <b>project </b>[ <b>-cCs </b>[ <b>-d </b><i>depth</i> ] [ <b>-p </b><i>path</i> ] <i>id</i> | <i>name</i> ]
              The <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, and <b>-s </b>options allow the directory tree quota
              mechanism to be maintained.  <b>-d </b>allows to limit recursion
              level when processing project directories and <b>-p </b>allows to
              specify project paths at command line ( instead of
              <i>/etc/projects</i> ). All options are discussed in detail below.
</pre>
<h2><a id="DIRECTORY_TREE_QUOTA" href="#DIRECTORY_TREE_QUOTA"></a>DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The project quota mechanism in XFS can be used to implement a form of
       directory tree quota, where a specified directory and all of the
       files and subdirectories below it (i.e. a tree) can be restricted to
       using a subset of the available space in the filesystem.

       A managed tree must be setup initially using the <b>-s </b>option to the
       <b>project </b>command. The specified project name or identifier is matched
       to one or more trees defined in <i>/etc/projects</i>, and these trees are
       then recursively descended to mark the affected inodes as being part
       of that tree.  This process sets an inode flag and the project
       identifier on every file in the affected tree.  Once this has been
       done, new files created in the tree will automatically be accounted
       to the tree based on their project identifier.  An attempt to create
       a hard link to a file in the tree will only succeed if the project
       identifier matches the project identifier for the tree.  The <b>xfs_io</b>
       utility can be used to set the project ID for an arbitrary file, but
       this can only be done by a privileged user.

       A previously setup tree can be cleared from project quota control
       through use of the <b>project -C </b>option, which will recursively descend
       the tree, clearing the affected inodes from project quota control.

       Finally, the <b>project -c </b>option can be used to check whether a tree is
       setup, it reports nothing if the tree is correct, otherwise it
       reports the paths of inodes which do not have the project ID of the
       rest of the tree, or if the inode flag is not set.

       Option <b>-d </b>can be used to limit recursion level (-1 is infinite, 0 is
       top level only, 1 is first level ... ).  Option <b>-p </b>adds possibility
       to specify project paths in command line without a need for
       <i>/etc/projects</i> to exist. Note that if projects file exists then it is
       also used.

<h2><a id="CAVEATS" href="#CAVEATS"></a>CAVEATS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       XFS implements delayed allocation (aka. allocate-on-flush) and this
       has implications for the quota subsystem.  Since quota accounting can
       only be done when blocks are actually allocated, it is possible to
       issue (buffered) writes into a file and not see the usage immediately
       updated.  Only when the data is actually written out, either via one
       of the kernels flushing mechanisms, or via a manual <a href="../man2/sync.2.html">sync(2)</a>, will the
       usage reported reflect what has actually been written.

       In addition, the XFS allocation mechanism will always reserve the
       maximum amount of space required before proceeding with an
       allocation.  If insufficient space for this reservation is available,
       due to the block quota limit being reached for example, this may
       result in the allocation failing even though there is sufficient
       space.  Quota enforcement can thus sometimes happen in situations
       where the user is under quota and the end result of some operation
       would still have left the user under quota had the operation been
       allowed to run its course.  This additional overhead is typically in
       the range of tens of blocks.

       Both of these properties are unavoidable side effects of the way XFS
       operates, so should be kept in mind when assigning block limits.
