   <b>NAME</b>
       csysdig - the ncurses user interface for sysdig

   <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>csysdig </b>[<i>option</i>]...  [<i>filter</i>]

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       csysdig  exports sysdig's functionality through an intuitive and pow‐
       erful ncurses-based user interface.

       csysdig has been designed to mimic tools like <b>top </b>and  <b>htop</b>,  but  it
       offers richer functionality, including:

       · Support for both live analysis and sysdig trace files.  Trace files
         can come from the same machine or from another machine.

       · Visibility into a broad range of metrics,  including  CPU,  memory,
         disk I/O, network I/O.

       · Ability to observe input/output activity for processes, files, net‐
         work connections and more.

       · Ability to drill down into processes,  files,  network  connections
         and more to further explore their behavior.

       · Full customization support.

       · Support for sysdig's filtering language.

       · Container support by design.

       csysdig  works  on any terminal, and has support for colors and mouse
       input.

       <b>Views</b>

       csysdig is based on the concept of 'views', little Lua  scripts  that
       determine  how  metrics  are  collected, processed and represented on
       screen.  Including a new visualization to csysdig doesn't require  to
       update  the  program,  and  is  simply a matter of adding a new view.
       Views rely on the sysdig processing engine, and this means that  they
       can include any sysdig filter field.  Views are located in the sysdig
       chisel directory path, usually <i>/usr/share/sysdig/chisels</i> and <i>~/.chis‐</i>
       <i>els</i>.

   <b>BASIC USAGE</b>
       Here are some basic tips to get you started with sysdig:

       1. If  you run csysdig without arguments, it will display live system
          data, updating every 2 seconds.  To analyze a trace file, use  the
          -r command line flag.

       2. You can switch to a different view by using the <i>F2</i> key.

       3. You  can  drill  down into a selection by clicking <i>enter</i>.  You can
          navigate back by typing <i>backspace</i>.

       4. You can observe input/output for the currently selected entity  by
          typing <i>F5</i>

       5. You  can  see  sysdig  events for the currently selected entity by
          typing <i>F6</i>

   <b>DRILLING DOWN</b>
       You drill down by selecting an element in a view  and  then  clicking
       <i>enter</i>.   Once inside a selection, you can switch to a different view,
       and the new view will be applied in the  context  of  the  selection.
       For  example,  if  you  drill down into a process called foo and then
       switch to the <i>Connections</i> view, the output will include only the con‐
       nections made or received by <i>foo</i>.

       To  drill down multiple times, keep clicking <i>enter</i>.  For example, you
       can click on a container in the <i>Containers</i> view to get the  processes
       running  inside it, and then click on one of the processes to see its
       threads.

   <b>ACTIONS AND HOTKEYS</b>
       Each view has a list of command lines that can  be  executed  in  the
       context of the current selection by pressing 'hotkeys'.  For example,
       pressing 'k' in the Processes view kills the selected process, press‐
       ing  'b'  in  the  Containers view opens a bash shell in the selected
       container.

       Each view supports different actions.  You can see  which  actions  a
       view  supports  by pressing F8.  You can customize the view's actions
       by editing the view's Lua file.

   <b>CONTAINERS SUPPORT</b>
       Starting csysdig with the -pc command line switch will cause many  of
       the  views to include additional container information.  For example,
       the <i>Processes</i> will include a column showing the container the process
       belongs to.  Similarly, the <i>Connections</i> view will show which contain‐
       er each connection belongs to.

   <b>MOUSE USAGE</b>
       · Clicking on column headers lets you sort the table.

       · Double clicking on row entries performs a drill down.

       · Clicking on the filter string at the top of the  screen  (the  text
         after  'Filter:')  lets  you change the sysdig filter and customize
         the view content.

       · You can use the mouse on the entries in the menu at the  bottom  of
         the screen to perform their respective actions.

   <b>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-d </b><i>period</i>, <b>--delay</b>=<i>period</i>
       Set  the  delay between updates, in milliseconds (by default = 2000).
       This works similarly to the -d option in top.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--exclude-users</b>
       Don't create the user/group tables by querying  the  OS  when  sysdig
       starts.   This  also means that no user or group info will be written
       to the tracefile by the -w flag.  The user/group tables are necessary
       to use filter fields like user.name or group.name.  However, creating
       them can increase sysdig's startup time.

       <b>--force-term-compat</b>
       Try to configure simple terminal settings (xterm-1002) that work bet‐
       ter  with  terminals like putty.  Try to use this flag if you experi‐
       ence terminal issues like the mouse not working.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
       Print this page

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--k8s-api</b>
       Enable Kubernetes support by connecting to the API  server  specified
       as  argument.   E.g.   "&lt;http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:8080&gt;".  The
       API server can also be specified via the  environment  variable  SYS‐
       DIG_K8S_API.

       <b>-K       </b><i>btfile</i>      <i>|</i>      <i>certfile:keyfile[#password][:cacertfile]</i>,
       <b>--k8s-api-cert=</b><i>btfile | certfile:keyfile[#password][:cacertfile]</i>
       Use the provided files names to authenticate  user  and  (optionally)
       verify  the  K8S  API  server identity.  Each entry must specify full
       (absolute, or relative to the current directory) path to the  respec‐
       tive  file.   Private key password is optional (needed only if key is
       password protected).  CA certificate is optional.  For all files, on‐
       ly  PEM  file format is supported.  Specifying CA certificate only is
       obsoleted - when single entry is provided for this option, it will be
       interpreted as the name of a file containing bearer token.  Note that
       the format of this command-line option prohibits use of  files  whose
       names contain ':' or '#' characters in the file name.  Option can al‐
       so be provided via the environment variable SYSDIG_K8S_API_CERT.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
       List all the fields that can be used in views.

       <b>--logfile </b><i>file</i>
       Print program logs into the given file.

       <b>-m </b><i>url[,marathon-url]</i>, <b>--mesos-api=</b><i>url[,marathon-url]</i>
       Enable Mesos support by connecting to the API server specified as ar‐
       gument  (e.g.  &lt;http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:5050&gt;).  Mesos url is
       required.  Marathon url is optional, defaulting to auto-follow  -  if
       Marathon API server is not provided, csysdig will attempt to retrieve
       (and subsequently follow, if it migrates) the  location  of  Marathon
       API server from the Mesos master.  Note that, with auto-follow, csys‐
       dig will likely receive a cluster internal IP  address  for  Marathon
       API  server, so running csysdig with Marathon auto-follow from a node
       that is not part of Mesos cluster may not work.   Additionally,  run‐
       ning csysdig with Mesos support on a node that has no containers man‐
       aged by Mesos is of limited use because,  although  cluster  metadata
       will be collected, there will be no Mesos/Marathon filtering capabil‐
       ity.  The API servers can also be specified via the environment vari‐
       able SYSDIG_MESOS_API.

       <b>-n </b><i>num</i>, <b>--numevents</b>=<i>num</i>
       Stop capturing after <i>num</i> events

       <b>-pc</b>, <b>-pcontainers</b>_
       Instruct  csysdig  to  use  a container-friendly format in its views.
       This will cause several of the views to contain  additional  contain‐
       er-related columns.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--resolve-ports</b>
       Resolve port numbers to names.

       <b>-r </b><i>readfile</i>, <b>--read</b>=<i>readfile</i>
       Read the events from <i>readfile</i>.

       <b>-s </b><i>len</i>, <b>--snaplen</b>=<i>len</i>
       Capture  the  first  <i>len</i>  bytes  of each I/O buffer.  By default, the
       first 80 bytes are captured.  Use this option with  caution,  it  can
       generate huge trace files.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--force-tracers-capture</b>
       Tell  the  driver  to  make  sure  full  buffers  are  captured  from
       /dev/null, to make sure that tracers are completely  captured.   Note
       that  sysdig  will  enable extended /dev/null capture by itself after
       detecting that tracers are written there, but that  could  result  in
       the truncation of some tracers at the beginning of the capture.  This
       option allows preventing that.

       <b>-v </b><i>view_id</i>, <b>--views</b>=<i>view_id</i>
       Run the view with the given ID when csysdig starts.  View IDs can  be
       found  in  the view documentation pages in csysdig.  Combine this op‐
       tion with a command line filter for complete output customization.

       <b>--version</b>
       Print version number.

   <b>FILTERING</b>
       Similarly to what you do with sysdig, you can specify a filter on the
       command line to restrict the events that csysdig processes.  To modi‐
       fy the filter while the program is running, or to  add  a  filter  at
       runtime, click on the filter text in the UI with the mouse.

   <b>CUSTOMIZING CSYSDIG</b>
       csysdig  is  completely customizable.  This means that you can modify
       any of the csysdig views, and even create your own views.  Like  sys‐
       dig  chisels, csysdig views are Lua scripts.  Full information can be
       found     at      the      following      github      wiki      page:
       &lt;https://github.com/draios/sysdig/wiki/csysdig-View-Format-Refer‐
       ence&gt;.

   <b>FILES</b>
       <i>/usr/share/sysdig/chisels</i>
       The global views directory.

       <i>~/.chisels</i>
       The personal views directory.
