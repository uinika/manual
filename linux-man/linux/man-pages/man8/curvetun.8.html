       curvetun is a lightweight, high-speed ECDH multiuser IP tunnel for
       Linux that is based on epoll(2). curvetun uses the Linux TUN/TAP
       interface and supports {IPv4, IPv6} over {IPv4, IPv6} with UDP or TCP
       as carrier protocols.

       It has an integrated packet forwarding tree, thus multiple users with
       different IPs can be handled via a single tunnel device on the server
       side, and flows are scheduled for processing in a CPU efficient way,
       at least in the case of TCP as the carrier protocol.

       For key management, public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves
       are used and packets are encrypted end-to-end by the symmetric stream
       cipher Salsa20 and authenticated by the MAC Poly1305, where keys have
       previously been computed with the ECDH key agreement protocol
       Curve25519.

       Cryptography is based on Daniel J. Bernstein's networking and
       cryptography library “NaCl”. By design, curvetun does not provide any
       particular pattern or default port numbers that gives certainty that
       the connection from a particular flow is actually running curvetun.

       However, if you have a further need to bypass censorship, you can try
       using curvetun in combination with Tor's obfsproxy or Telex.
       Furthermore, curvetun also protects you against replay attacks and DH
       man-in-the-middle attacks.  Additionally, server-side syslog event
       logging can also be disabled to avoid revealing critical user
       connection data.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
   <b>-d &lt;tundev&gt;, --dev &lt;tundev&gt;</b>
       Defines the name of the tunnel device that is being created. If this
       option is not set, then the default names, curves{0,1,2,..} for a
       curvetun server, and curvec{0,1,2,...} for a curvetun client are
       used.

   <b>-p &lt;num&gt;, --port &lt;num&gt;</b>
       Defines the port the curvetun server should listen on. There is no
       default port for curvetun, so setting this option for server
       bootstrap is mandatory. This option is for servers only.

   <b>-t &lt;server&gt;, --stun &lt;server&gt;</b>
       If needed, this options enables an STUN lookup in order to show
       public IP to port mapping and to punch a hole into the firewall. In
       case you are unsure what STUN server to use, simply use ''--stun
       stunserver.org''.

   <b>-c[=alias], --client[=alias]</b>
       Starts curvetun in client mode and connects to the given connection
       alias that is defined in the configuration file.

   <b>-k, --keygen</b>
       Generate private and public keypair. This must be done initially.

   <b>-x, --export</b>
       Export user and key combination to stdout as a one-liner.

   <b>-C, --dumpc</b>
       Dump all known clients that may connect to the local curvetun server
       and exit.

   <b>-S, --dumps</b>
       Dump all known servers curvetun as a client can connect to, and exit.

   <b>-D, --nofork</b>
       Do not fork off as a client or server on startup.

   <b>-s, --server</b>
       Start curvetun in server mode. Additional parameters are needed, at
       least the definition of the port that clients can connect to is
       required.

   <b>-N, --no-logging</b>
       Disable all curvetun logging of user information. This option can be
       used to enable curvetun users to connect more anonymously. This
       option is for servers only.

   <b>-u, --udp</b>
       Use UDP as a carrier protocol instead of TCP. By default, TCP is the
       carrier protocol. This option is for servers only.

   <b>-4, --ipv4</b>
       Defines IPv4 as the underlying network protocol to be used on the
       tunnel device. IPv4 is the default. This option is for servers only.

   <b>-6, --ipv6</b>
       Defines IPv6 as the underlying network protocol to be used on the
       tunnel device. This option is for servers only.

   <b>-v, --version</b>
       Show version information and exit.

   <b>-h, --help</b>
       Show user help and exit.

<h2><a id="CRYPTOGRAPHY" href="#CRYPTOGRAPHY"></a>CRYPTOGRAPHY  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Encrypted IP tunnels are often used to create virtual private
       networks (VPN), where parts of the network can only be reached via an
       insecure or untrusted medium such as the Internet. Only a few
       software utilities exist to create such tunnels, or, VPNs. Two
       popular representatives of such software are OpenVPN and VTUN.

       The latter also introduced the TUN/TAP interfaces into the Linux
       kernel. VTUN only has a rather basic encryption module, that does not
       fit today's cryptographic needs. By default, MD5 is used to create
       128-Bit wide keys for the symmetric BlowFish cipher in ECB mode [1].

       Although OpenSSL is used in both VTUN and OpenVPN, OpenVPN is much
       more feature rich regarding ciphers and user authentication.
       Nevertheless, letting people choose ciphers or authentication methods
       is not necessarily a good thing: administrators could either prefer
       speed over security and therefore choose weak ciphers, so that the
       communication system will be as good as without any cipher; they
       could choose weak passwords for symmetric encryption or they could
       misconfigure the communication system by having too much choice of
       ciphers and too little experience for picking the right one.

       Next to the administration issues, there are also software
       development issues.  Cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL are a huge
       mess and too low-level and complex to fully understand or correctly
       apply, so that they form further ground for vulnerabilities of such
       software.

       In 2010, the cryptographers Tanja Lange and Daniel J. Bernstein have
       therefore created and published a cryptographic library for
       networking, which is named NaCl (pronounced ''salt''). NaCl addresses
       such problems as mentioned in OpenSSL and, in contrast to the rather
       generic use of OpenSSL, was created with a strong focus on public-key
       authenticated encryption based on elliptic curve cryptography, which
       is used in curvetun. Partially quoting Daniel J.  Bernstein:

       "RSA is somewhat older than elliptic-curve cryptography: RSA was
       introduced in 1977, while elliptic-curve cryptography was introduced
       in 1985. However, RSA has shown many more weaknesses than elliptic-
       curve cryptography. RSA's effective security level was dramatically
       reduced by the linear sieve in the late 1970s, by the quadratic sieve
       and ECM in the 1980s, and by the number-field sieve in the 1990s. For
       comparison, a few attacks have been developed against some rare
       elliptic curves having special algebraic structures, and the amount
       of computer power available to attackers has predictably increased,
       but typical elliptic curves require just as much computer power to
       break today as they required twenty years ago.

       IEEE P1363 standardized elliptic-curve cryptography in the late
       1990s, including a stringent list of security criteria for elliptic
       curves. NIST used the IEEE P1363 criteria to select fifteen specific
       elliptic curves at five different security levels. In 2005, NSA
       issued a new ''Suite B'' standard, recommending the NIST elliptic
       curves (at two specific security levels) for all public-key
       cryptography and withdrawing previous recommendations of RSA."

       curvetun uses a particular elliptic curve, Curve25519, introduced in
       the following paper: Daniel J. Bernstein, ''Curve25519: new Diffie-
       Hellman speed records,'' pages 207-228 in Proceedings of PKC 2006,
       edited by Moti Yung, Yevgeniy Dodis, Aggelos Kiayias, and Tal Malkin,
       Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3958, Springer, 2006, ISBN
       3-540-33851-9.

       This elliptic curve follows all of the standard IEEE P1363 security
       criteria.  It also follows new recommendations that achieve ''side-
       channel immunity'' and ''twist security'' while improving speed. What
       this means is that secure implementations of Curve25519 are
       considerably simpler and faster than secure implementations of, for
       example, NIST P-256; there are fewer opportunities for implementors
       to make mistakes that compromise security, and mistakes are more
       easily caught by reviewers.

       An attacker who spends a billion dollars on special-purpose chips to
       attack Curve25519, using the best attacks available today, has about
       1 chance in 1000000000000000000000000000 of breaking Curve25519 after
       a year of computation.  One could achieve similar levels of security
       with 3000-bit RSA, but encryption and authentication with 3000-bit
       RSA are not nearly fast enough to handle tunnel traffic and would
       require much more space in network packets.

<h2><a id="SETUP_HOWTO" href="#SETUP_HOWTO"></a>SETUP HOWTO  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If you have not run curvetun before, you need to do an initial setup
       once.

       First, make sure that the servers and clients clocks are periodically
       synced, for example, by running an NTP daemon. This is necessary to
       protect against replay attacks. Also, make sure you have read and
       write access to /dev/net/tun. You should not run curvetun as root!
       Then, after you have assured this, the first step is to generate keys
       and config files. On both the client and server do:

       <b>curvetun -k</b>

       You are asked for a user name. You can use an email address or
       whatever suits you. Here, we assume you have entered 'mysrv1' on the
       server and 'myclient1' on the client side.

       Now, all necessary files have been created under ~/.curvetun. Files
       include “priv.key”, “pub.key”, “username”, “clients” and “servers”.

       “clients” and “servers” are empty at the beginning and need to be
       filled. The “clients” file is meant for the server, so that it knows
       what clients are allowed to connect. The “servers” file is for the
       client, where it can select curvetun servers to connect to. Both
       files are kept very simple, so that a single configuration line per
       client or server is sufficient.

       The client needs to export its public key data for the server

       <b>curvetun -x</b>

       where it prints a string in the following format:

         myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
         \_______/
       \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
          username  32 byte public key for 'myclient1'

       This line is transferred to the server admin (yes, we assume a manual
       on-site key exchange scenario where, for example, the admin sets up
       server and clients), where the admin then adds this entry into his
       ''clients'' file like:

         server$ echo
       "myclient1;11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:" \
                      "11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11" &gt;&gt;
       ~/.curvetun/clients

       The server admin can check if the server has registered it properly
       as follows:

         server$ curvetun -C

       which prints all parsed clients from ''~/.curvetun/clients''. This
       process could easily be automated or scripted with, for example, Perl
       and LDAP.

       Now, the client ''myclient1'' is known to the server; that completes
       the server configuration. The next step is to tell the client where
       it needs to connect to the server.

       We assume in this example that the tunnel server has a public IP
       address, e.g. 1.2.3.4, runs on port 6666 and uses UDP as a carrier
       protocol. In case you are behind NAT, you can use curvetun's
       ''--stun'' option for starting the server, to obtain your mapping.
       However, in this example we continue with 1.2.3.4 and 6666, UDP.

       First, the server needs to export its key to the client, as follows:

         server$ curvetun -x

       where it prints a string in the following format:

         mysrv1;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22
         \____/
       \_____________________________________________________________________________________________/
        username  32 byte public key for 'mysrv1'
                  ^-- you need this public key

       Thus, you now have the server IP address, server port, server
       transport protocol and the server's public key at hand. On the client
       side it can be put all together in the config as follows:

         client$ echo
       "myfirstserver;1.2.3.4;6666;udp;22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:" \
                      "22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:22:"
       \
                      "22:22" &gt;&gt; ~/.curvetun/servers

       The client can check its config using:

         client$ curvetun -S

       Then we start the server with:

         server$ curvetun -s -p 6666 -u
         server# ifconfig curves0 up
         server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24

       Then, we start the client with:

         client$ curvetun -c=myfirstserver
         client# ifconfig curvec0 up
         client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24

       Also, client-side information, errors, or warnings will appear in
       syslog! By now we should be able to ping the server:

         client$ ping 10.0.0.1

       That's it! Routing example:

       Server side's public IP on eth0 is, for example, 1.2.3.4:

         server$ ... start curvetun server ...
         server# ifconfig curves0 up
         server# ifconfig curves0 10.0.0.1/24
         server# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
         server# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
         server# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o curves0 -m state --state
       RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
         server# iptables -A FORWARD -i curves0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

       Client side's IP on eth0 is, for example, 5.6.7.8:

         client$ ... start curvetun client ...
         client# ... lookup your default gateway (e.g. via route, here:
       5.6.7.9) ...
         client# ifconfig curvec0 up
         client# ifconfig curvec0 10.0.0.2/24
         client# route add -net 1.2.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 5.6.7.9 dev
       eth0
         client# route add default gw 10.0.0.1
         client# route del default gw 5.6.7.9

       That should be it, happy browsing and emailing via curvetun tunnels!
