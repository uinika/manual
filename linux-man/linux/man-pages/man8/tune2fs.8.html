<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>tune2fs </b>allows the system administrator to adjust various tunable
       filesystem parameters on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.  The
       current values of these options can be displayed by using the <b>-l</b>
       option to <a href="tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a> program, or by using the <a href="dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs(8)</a> program.

       The <i>device</i> specifier can either be a filename (i.e., /dev/sda1), or a
       LABEL or UUID specifier: "<b>LABEL=</b><i>volume-label</i>" or "<b>UUID=</b><i>uuid</i>".  (i.e.,
       LABEL=home or UUID=e40486c6-84d5-4f2f-b99c-032281799c9d).
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-c </b><i>max-mount-counts</i>
              Adjust the number of mounts after which the filesystem will be
              checked by <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a>.  If <i>max-mount-counts</i> is 0 or -1, the
              number of times the filesystem is mounted will be disregarded
              by <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> and the kernel.

              Staggering the mount-counts at which filesystems are forcibly
              checked will avoid all filesystems being checked at one time
              when using journaled filesystems.

              You should strongly consider the consequences of disabling
              mount-count-dependent checking entirely.  Bad disk drives,
              cables, memory, and kernel bugs could all corrupt a filesystem
              without marking the filesystem dirty or in error.  If you are
              using journaling on your filesystem, your filesystem will
              <b>never </b>be marked dirty, so it will not normally be checked.  A
              filesystem error detected by the kernel will still force an
              fsck on the next reboot, but it may already be too late to
              prevent data loss at that point.

              See also the <b>-i </b>option for time-dependent checking.

       <b>-C </b><i>mount-count</i>
              Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted.  If
              set to a greater value than the max-mount-counts parameter set
              by the <b>-c </b>option, <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> will check the filesystem at the
              next reboot.

       <b>-e </b><i>error-behavior</i>
              Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are
              detected.  In all cases, a filesystem error will cause
              <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> to check the filesystem on the next boot.  <i>error-</i>
              <i>behavior</i> can be one of the following:

                   <b>continue    </b>Continue normal execution.

                   <b>remount-ro  </b>Remount filesystem read-only.

                   <b>panic       </b>Cause a kernel panic.

       <b>-E </b><i>extended-options</i>
              Set extended options for the filesystem.  Extended options are
              comma separated, and may take an argument using the equals
              ('=') sign.  The following extended options are supported:

                   <b>clear_mmp</b>
                          Reset the MMP block (if any) back to the clean
                          state.  Use only if absolutely certain the device
                          is not currently mounted or being fscked, or major
                          filesystem corruption can result.  Needs '-f'.

                   <b>mmp_update_interval=</b><i>interval</i>
                          Adjust the initial MMP update interval to <i>interval</i>
                          seconds.  Specifying an <i>interval</i> of 0 means to use
                          the default interval.  The specified interval must
                          be less than 300 seconds.  Requires that the <b>mmp</b>
                          feature be enabled.

                   <b>stride=</b><i>stride-size</i>
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with
                          <i>stride-size</i> filesystem blocks. This is the number
                          of blocks read or written to disk before moving to
                          next disk. This mostly affects placement of
                          filesystem metadata like bitmaps at <b>mke2fs</b>(2) time
                          to avoid placing them on a single disk, which can
                          hurt the performance.  It may also be used by
                          block allocator.

                   <b>stripe_width=</b><i>stripe-width</i>
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with
                          <i>stripe-width</i> filesystem blocks per stripe. This is
                          typically be stride-size * N, where N is the
                          number of data disks in the RAID (e.g. RAID 5 N+1,
                          RAID 6 N+2).  This allows the block allocator to
                          prevent read-modify-write of the parity in a RAID
                          stripe if possible when the data is written.

                   <b>hash_alg=</b><i>hash-alg</i>
                          Set the default hash algorithm used for
                          filesystems with hashed b-tree directories.  Valid
                          algorithms accepted are: <i>legacy</i>, <i>half_md4</i>, and
                          <i>tea</i>.

                   <b>mount_opts=</b><i>mount_option_string</i>
                          Set a set of default mount options which will be
                          used when the file system is mounted.  Unlike the
                          bitmask-based default mount options which can be
                          specified with the <b>-o </b>option, <i>mount_option_string</i>
                          is an arbitrary string with a maximum length of 63
                          bytes, which is stored in the superblock.

                          The ext4 file system driver will first apply the
                          bitmask-based default options, and then parse the
                          <i>mount_option_string</i>, before parsing the mount
                          options passed from the <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> program.

                          This superblock setting is only honored in 2.6.35+
                          kernels; and not at all by the ext2 and ext3 file
                          system drivers.

                   <b>test_fs</b>
                          Set a flag in the filesystem superblock indicating
                          that it may be mounted using experimental kernel
                          code, such as the ext4dev filesystem.

                   <b>^test_fs</b>
                          Clear the test_fs flag, indicating the filesystem
                          should only be mounted using production-level
                          filesystem code.

       <b>-f     </b>Force the tune2fs operation to complete even in the face of
              errors.  This option is useful when removing the <b>has_journal</b>
              filesystem feature from a filesystem which has an external
              journal (or is corrupted such that it appears to have an
              external journal), but that external journal is not available.
              If the filesystem appears to require journal replay, the <b>-f</b>
              flag must be specified twice to proceed.

              <b>WARNING: </b>Removing an external journal from a filesystem which
              was not cleanly unmounted without first replaying the external
              journal can result in severe data loss and filesystem
              corruption.

       <b>-g </b><i>group</i>
              Set the group which can use the reserved filesystem blocks.
              The <i>group</i> parameter can be a numerical gid or a group name.
              If a group name is given, it is converted to a numerical gid
              before it is stored in the superblock.

       <b>-i  </b><i>interval-between-checks</i>[<b>d</b>|<b>m</b>|<b>w</b>]
              Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks.  No
              suffix or <b>d </b>will interpret the number <i>interval-between-checks</i>
              as days, <b>m </b>as months, and <b>w </b>as weeks.  A value of zero will
              disable the time-dependent checking.

              It is strongly recommended that either <b>-c </b>(mount-count-
              dependent) or <b>-i </b>(time-dependent) checking be enabled to force
              periodic full <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> checking of the filesystem.  Failure
              to do so may lead to filesystem corruption (due to bad disks,
              cables, memory, or kernel bugs) going unnoticed, ultimately
              resulting in data loss or corruption.

       <b>-I     </b>Change the inode size used by the file system.   This requires
              rewriting the inode table, so it requires that the file system
              is checked for consistency first using <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a>.  This
              operation can also take a while and the file system can be
              corrupted and data lost if it is interrupted while in the
              middle of converting the file system.

       <b>-j     </b>Add an ext3 journal to the filesystem.  If the <b>-J </b>option is
              not specified, the default journal parameters will be used to
              create an appropriately sized journal (given the size of the
              filesystem) stored within the filesystem.  Note that you must
              be using a kernel which has ext3 support in order to actually
              make use of the journal.

              If this option is used to create a journal on a mounted
              filesystem, an immutable file, <b>.journal</b>, will be created in
              the top-level directory of the filesystem, as it is the only
              safe way to create the journal inode while the filesystem is
              mounted.  While the ext3 journal is visible, it is not safe to
              delete it, or modify it while the filesystem is mounted; for
              this reason the file is marked immutable.  While checking
              unmounted filesystems, <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> will automatically move
              <b>.journal </b>files to the invisible, reserved journal inode.  For
              all filesystems except for the root filesystem,  this should
              happen automatically and naturally during the next reboot
              cycle.  Since the root filesystem is mounted read-only,
              <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> must be run from a rescue floppy in order to effect
              this transition.

              On some distributions, such as Debian, if an initial ramdisk
              is used, the initrd scripts will automatically convert an ext2
              root filesystem to ext3 if the <b>/etc/fstab </b>file specifies the
              ext3 filesystem for the root filesystem in order to avoid
              requiring the use of a rescue floppy to add an ext3 journal to
              the root filesystem.

       <b>-J </b>journal-options
              Override the default ext3 journal parameters. Journal options
              are comma separated, and may take an argument using the equals
              ('=')  sign.  The following journal options are supported:

                   <b>size=</b><i>journal-size</i>
                          Create a journal stored in the filesystem of size
                          <i>journal-size</i> megabytes.   The size of the journal
                          must be at least 1024 filesystem blocks (i.e., 1MB
                          if using 1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks, etc.)
                          and may be no more than 10,240,000 filesystem
                          blocks.  There must be enough free space in the
                          filesystem to create a journal of that size.

                   <b>location</b><i>=journal-location</i>
                          Specify the location of the journal.  The argument
                          <i>journal-location</i> can either be specified as a
                          block number, or if the number has a units suffix
                          (e.g., 'M', 'G', etc.) interpret it as the offset
                          from the beginning of the file system.

                   <b>device=</b><i>external-journal</i>
                          Attach the filesystem to the journal block device
                          located on <i>external-journal</i>.  The external journal
                          must have been already created using the command

                          <b>mke2fs -O journal_dev </b><i>external-journal</i>

                          Note that <i>external-journal</i> must be formatted with
                          the same block size as filesystems which will be
                          using it.  In addition, while there is support for
                          attaching multiple filesystems to a single
                          external journal, the Linux kernel and <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a>
                          do not currently support shared external journals
                          yet.

                          Instead of specifying a device name directly,
                          <i>external-journal</i> can also be specified by either
                          <b>LABEL=</b><i>label</i> or <b>UUID=</b><i>UUID</i> to locate the external
                          journal by either the volume label or UUID stored
                          in the ext2 superblock at the start of the
                          journal.  Use <a href="dumpe2fs.8.html">dumpe2fs(8)</a> to display a journal
                          device's volume label and UUID.  See also the <b>-L</b>
                          option of <a href="tune2fs.8.html">tune2fs(8)</a>.

              Only one of the <b>size </b>or <b>device </b>options can be given for a
              filesystem.

       <b>-l     </b>List the contents of the filesystem superblock, including the
              current values of the parameters that can be set via this
              program.

       <b>-L </b><i>volume-label</i>
              Set the volume label of the filesystem.  Ext2 filesystem
              labels can be at most 16 characters long; if <i>volume-label</i> is
              longer than 16 characters, <b>tune2fs </b>will truncate it and print
              a warning.  The volume label can be used by <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>, <a href="fsck.8.html">fsck(8)</a>,
              and <b>/etc/fstab</b>(5) (and possibly others) by specifying
              <b>LABEL=</b><i>volume-label</i> instead of a block special device name like
              <b>/dev/hda5</b>.

       <b>-m </b><i>reserved-blocks-percentage</i>
              Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be
              allocated by privileged processes.   Reserving some number of
              filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is done to
              avoid filesystem fragmentation, and to allow system daemons,
              such as <b>syslogd</b>(8), to continue to function correctly after
              non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the
              filesystem.  Normally, the default percentage of reserved
              blocks is 5%.

       <b>-M </b><i>last-mounted-directory</i>
              Set the last-mounted directory for the filesystem.

       <b>-o </b>[^]<i>mount-option</i>[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated default mount options in the
              filesystem.  Default mount options can be overridden by mount
              options specified either in <b>/etc/fstab</b>(5) or on the command
              line arguments to <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>.  Older kernels may not support
              this feature; in particular, kernels which predate 2.4.20 will
              almost certainly ignore the default mount options field in the
              superblock.

              More than one mount option can be cleared or set by separating
              features with commas.  Mount options prefixed with a caret
              character ('^') will be cleared in the filesystem's
              superblock; mount options without a prefix character or
              prefixed with a plus character ('+') will be added to the
              filesystem.

              The following mount options can be set or cleared using
              <b>tune2fs</b>:

                   <b>debug  </b>Enable debugging code for this filesystem.

                   <b>bsdgroups</b>
                          Emulate BSD behavior when creating new files: they
                          will take the group-id of the directory in which
                          they were created.  The standard System V behavior
                          is the default, where newly created files take on
                          the fsgid of the current process, unless the
                          directory has the setgid bit set, in which case it
                          takes the gid from the parent directory, and also
                          gets the setgid bit set if it is a directory
                          itself.

                   <b>user_xattr</b>
                          Enable user-specified extended attributes.

                   <b>acl    </b>Enable Posix Access Control Lists.

                   <b>uid16  </b>Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for
                          interoperability with older kernels which only
                          store and expect 16-bit values.

                   <b>journal_data</b>
                          When the filesystem is mounted with journalling
                          enabled, all data (not just metadata) is committed
                          into the journal prior to being written into the
                          main filesystem.

                   <b>journal_data_ordered</b>
                          When the filesystem is mounted with journalling
                          enabled, all data is forced directly out to the
                          main file system prior to its metadata being
                          committed to the journal.

                   <b>journal_data_writeback</b>
                          When the filesystem is mounted with journalling
                          enabled, data may be written into the main
                          filesystem after its metadata has been committed
                          to the journal.  This may increase throughput,
                          however, it may allow old data to appear in files
                          after a crash and journal recovery.

                   <b>nobarrier</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with barrier
                          operations in the journal disabled.  (This option
                          is currently only supported by the ext4 file
                          system driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)

                   <b>block_validity</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with the
                          block_validity option enabled, which causes extra
                          checks to be performed after reading or writing
                          from the file system.  This prevents corrupted
                          metadata blocks from causing file system damage by
                          overwriting parts of the inode table or block
                          group descriptors.  This comes at the cost of
                          increased memory and CPU overhead, so it is
                          enabled only for debugging purposes.  (This option
                          is currently only supported by the ext4 file
                          system driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)

                   <b>discard</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with the discard
                          mount option.  This will cause the file system
                          driver to attempt to use the trim/discard feature
                          of some storage devices (such as SSD's and thin-
                          provisioned drives available in some enterprise
                          storage arrays) to inform the storage device that
                          blocks belonging to deleted files can be reused
                          for other purposes.  (This option is currently
                          only supported by the ext4 file system driver in
                          2.6.35+ kernels.)

                   <b>nodelalloc</b>
                          The file system will be mounted with the
                          nodelalloc mount option.  This will disable the
                          delayed allocation feature.  (This option is
                          currently only supported by the ext4 file system
                          driver in 2.6.35+ kernels.)

       <b>-O </b>[^]<i>feature</i>[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in
              the filesystem.  More than one filesystem feature can be
              cleared or set by separating features with commas.  Filesystem
              features prefixed with a caret character ('^') will be cleared
              in the filesystem's superblock; filesystem features without a
              prefix character or prefixed with a plus character ('+') will
              be added to the filesystem.  For a detailed description of the
              file system features, please see the man page <a href="../man5/ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a>.

              The following filesystem features can be set or cleared using
              <b>tune2fs</b>:

                   <b>dir_index</b>
                          Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups for large
                          directories.

                   <b>dir_nlink</b>
                          Allow more than 65000 subdirectories per
                          directory.

                   <b>encrypt</b>
                          Enable file system level encryption.  <b>Tune2fs</b>
                          currently only supports setting this filesystem
                          feature.

                   <b>extent </b>Enable the use of extent trees to store the
                          location of data blocks in inodes.  <b>Tune2fs</b>
                          currently only supports setting this filesystem
                          feature.

                   <b>extra_isize</b>
                          Enable the extended inode fields used by ext4.

                   <b>filetype</b>
                          Store file type information in directory entries.

                   <b>flex_bg</b>
                          Allow bitmaps and inode tables for a block group
                          to be placed anywhere on the storage media.
                          <b>Tune2fs </b>will not reorganize the location of the
                          inode tables and allocation bitmaps, as <a href="mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>
                          will do when it creates a freshly formatted file
                          system with <b>flex_bg </b>enabled.

                   <b>has_journal</b>
                          Use a journal to ensure filesystem consistency
                          even across unclean shutdowns.  Setting the
                          filesystem feature is equivalent to using the <b>-j</b>
                          option.

                   <b>huge_file</b>
                          Support files larger than 2 terabytes in size.

                   <b>large_file</b>
                          Filesystem can contain files that are greater than
                          2GB.

                   <b>metadata_csum</b>
                          Store a checksum to protect the contents in each
                          metadata block.

                   <b>mmp    </b>Enable or disable multiple mount protection (MMP)
                          feature.

                   <b>project</b>
                          Enable project ID tracking.  This is used for
                          project quota tracking.

                   <b>quota  </b>Enable internal file system quota inodes.

                   <b>read-only</b>
                          Force the kernel to mount the file system read-
                          only.

                   <b>resize_inode</b>
                          Reserve space so the block group descriptor table
                          may grow in the future.  <b>Tune2fs </b>only supports
                          clearing this filesystem feature.

                   <b>sparse_super</b>
                          Limit the number of backup superblocks to save
                          space on large filesystems.  <b>Tune2fs </b>currently
                          only supports setting this filesystem feature.

                   <b>uninit_bg</b>
                          Allow the kernel to initialize bitmaps and inode
                          tables lazily, and to keep a high watermark for
                          the unused inodes in a filesystem, to reduce
                          <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> time.  The first e2fsck run after
                          enabling this feature will take the full time, but
                          subsequent e2fsck runs will take only a fraction
                          of the original time, depending on how full the
                          file system is.

              After setting or clearing <b>sparse_super</b>, <b>uninit_bg</b>, <b>filetype</b>,
              or <b>resize_inode </b>filesystem features, the file system may
              require being checked using <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> to return the filesystem
              to a consistent state.  <b>Tune2fs </b>will print a message
              requesting that the system administrator run <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> if
              necessary.  After setting the <b>dir_index </b>feature, <b>e2fsck -D </b>can
              be run to convert existing directories to the hashed B-tree
              format.  Enabling certain filesystem features may prevent the
              filesystem from being mounted by kernels which do not support
              those features.  In particular, the <b>uninit_bg </b>and <b>flex_bg</b>
              features are only supported by the ext4 filesystem.

       <b>-p </b><i>mmp_check_interval</i>
              Set the desired MMP check interval in seconds. It is 5 seconds
              by default.

       <b>-r </b><i>reserved-blocks-count</i>
              Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks.

       <b>-Q </b><i>quota-options</i>
              Sets 'quota' feature on the superblock and works on the quota
              files for the given quota type. Quota options could be one or
              more of the following:

                   <b>[^]usrquota</b>
                          Sets/clears user quota inode in the superblock.

                   <b>[^]grpquota</b>
                          Sets/clears group quota inode in the superblock.

                   <b>[^]prjquota</b>
                          Sets/clears project quota inode in the superblock.

       <b>-T </b><i>time-last-checked</i>
              Set the time the filesystem was last checked using <b>e2fsck</b>.
              The time is interpreted using the current (local) timezone.
              This can be useful in scripts which use a Logical Volume
              Manager to make a consistent snapshot of a filesystem, and
              then check the filesystem during off hours to make sure it
              hasn't been corrupted due to hardware problems, etc.  If the
              filesystem was clean, then this option can be used to set the
              last checked time on the original filesystem.  The format of
              <i>time-last-checked</i> is the international date format, with an
              optional time specifier, i.e.  YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]].   The
              keyword <b>now </b>is also accepted, in which case the last checked
              time will be set to the current time.

       <b>-u </b><i>user</i>
              Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks.  <i>user</i>
              can be a numerical uid or a user name.  If a user name is
              given, it is converted to a numerical uid before it is stored
              in the superblock.

       <b>-U </b><i>UUID</i>
              Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the filesystem
              to <i>UUID</i>.  The format of the UUID is a series of hex digits
              separated by hyphens, like this:
              "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".  The <i>UUID</i> parameter
              may also be one of the following:

                   <i>clear</i>  clear the filesystem UUID

                   <i>random</i> generate a new randomly-generated UUID

                   <i>time</i>   generate a new time-based UUID

              The UUID may be used by <a href="mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>, <a href="fsck.8.html">fsck(8)</a>, and <b>/etc/fstab</b>(5)
              (and possibly others) by specifying <b>UUID=</b><i>uuid</i> instead of a
              block special device name like <b>/dev/hda1</b>.

              See <b>uuidgen</b>(8) for more information.  If the system does not
              have a good random number generator such as <i>/dev/random</i> or
              <i>/dev/urandom</i>, <b>tune2fs </b>will automatically use a time-based UUID
              instead of a randomly-generated UUID.

       <b>-z </b><i>undo_file</i>
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents
              of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can be used with
              e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the file system
              should something go wrong.  If the empty string is passed as
              the undo_file argument, the undo file will be written to a
              file named tune2fs-<i>device</i>.e2undo in the directory specified
