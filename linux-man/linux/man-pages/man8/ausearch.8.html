       <b>ausearch </b>is a tool that can query the audit daemon logs based for
       events based on different search criteria. The ausearch utility can
       also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data.
       Each commandline option given forms an "and" statement. For example,
       searching with <b>-m </b>and <b>-ui </b>means return events that have both the
       requested type and match the user id given. An exception is the <b>-m</b>
       and <b>-n </b>options; multiple record types and nodes are allowed in a
       search which will return any matching node and record.

       It should also be noted that each syscall excursion from user space
       into the kernel and back into user space has one event ID that is
       unique. Any auditable event that is triggered during this trip share
       this ID so that they may be correlated.

       Different parts of the kernel may add supplemental records. For
       example, an audit event on the syscall "open" will also cause the
       kernel to emit a PATH record with the file name. The ausearch utility
       will present all records that make up one event together. This could
       mean that even though you search for a specific kind of record, the
       resulting events may contain SYSCALL records.

       Also be aware that not all record types have the requested
       information. For example, a PATH record does not have a hostname or a
       loginuid.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--event </b><i>audit-event-id</i>
              Search for an event based on the given <i>event ID</i>. Messages
              always start with something like
              msg=audit(1116360555.329:2401771). The event ID is the number
              after the ':'. All audit events that are recorded from one
              application's syscall have the same audit event ID. A second
              syscall made by the same application will have a different
              event ID. This way they are unique.

       <b>--arch </b><i>CPU</i>
              Search for events based on a specific CPU architecture.  If
              you do not know the arch of your machine but you want to use
              the 32 bit syscall table and your machine supports 32 bits,
              you can also use <b>b32 </b>for the arch. The same applies to the 64
              bit syscall table, you can use <b>b64.  </b>The arch of your machine
              can be found by doing 'uname -m'.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--comm </b><i>comm-name</i>
              Search for an event based on the given <i>comm name</i>. The comm
              name is the executable's name from the task structure.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Write malformed events that are skipped to stderr.

       <b>--checkpoint </b><i>checkpoint-file</i>
              Checkpoint the output between successive invocations of
              ausearch such that only events not previously output will
              print in subsequent invocations.

              An auditd event is made up of one or more records. When
              processing events, ausearch defines events as either complete
              or in-complete.  A complete event is either a single record
              event or one whose event time occurred 2 seconds in the past
              compared to the event being currently processed.

              A checkpoint is achieved by recording the last completed event
              output along with the device number and inode of the file the
              last completed event appeared in <i>checkpoint-file</i>. On a
              subsequent invocation, ausearch will load this checkpoint data
              and as it processes the log files, it will discard all
              complete events until it matches the checkpointed one. At this
              point, it will start outputting complete events.

              Should the file or the last checkpointed event not be found,
              one of a number of errors will result and ausearch will
              terminate. See <b>EXIT STATUS </b>for detail.

       <b>-e, </b>--exit <i>exit-code-or-errno</i>
              Search for an event based on the given syscall <i>exit code or</i>
              <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       <b>--escape </b><i>option</i>
              This option determines if the output is escaped to make the
              content safer for certain uses. The options are <i>raw</i> , <i>tty</i> ,
              <i>shell</i> , and <i>shell_quote</i>. Each mode includes the characters of
              the preceding mode and escapes more characters. That is to say
              <i>shell</i> includes all characters escaped by <i>tty</i> and adds more.
              <i>tty</i> is the default.

       <b>--extra-keys</b>
              When the <i>format</i> mode is <i>csv</i>, this option will add a final
              column with key information if its exists for the event. This
              would only occur on SYSCALL records which were the result of
              triggering an audit rule that defines a key.

       <b>--extra-labels</b>
              When the <i>format</i> mode is <i>csv</i>, this option will add columns of
              information about subject and object labels when they exist.

       <b>--extra-time</b>
              When the <i>format</i> mode is <i>csv</i>, this option will add columns of
              information about broken down time to make subsetting easier.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file </b><i>file-name</i>
              Search for an event based on the given <i>filename</i>. The argument
              will match normal files as well as af_unix sockets.

       <b>--format </b><i>option</i>
              Events that match the search criteria are formatted using this
              option. The supported formats are: raw, default, interpret,
              csv, and text. The <i>raw</i> option is described under the <i>--raw</i>
              command line option. The <i>default</i> option is what you get when
              no formatting options are passed. It includes one line as a
              visual separator which indicates the time stamp and then the
              records of the event follow. The <i>interpret</i> option is explained
              under the <i>-i</i> command line option. The <i>csv</i> option outputs the
              results of the search as a normalized event in comma separated
              value (CSV) format suitable for import into analytical
              programs. The <i>text</i> option turns the event into an English
              sentence that is easier to understand than other options, but
              it comes at the expense of loss of detail. In most cases this
              is perfectly fine since the original event still retains all
              the original information.

       <b>-ga</b>, <b>--gid-all </b><i>all-group-id</i>
              Search for an event with either effective group ID or group ID
              matching the given <i>group ID</i>.

       <b>-ge</b>, <b>--gid-effective </b><i>effective-group-id</i>
              Search for an event with the given <i>effective group ID</i> or group
              name.

       <b>-gi</b>, <b>--gid </b><i>group-id</i>
              Search for an event with the given <i>group ID</i> or group name.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Help

       <b>-hn</b>, <b>--host </b><i>host-name</i>
              Search for an event with the given <i>host name</i>. The hostname can
              be either a hostname, fully qualified domain name, or numeric
              network address. No attempt is made to resolve numeric
              addresses to domain names or aliases.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interpret</b>
              Interpret numeric entities into text. For example, uid is
              converted to account name. If the audit logs are unenriched,
              the conversion is done using the current resources of the
              machine where the search is being run. If you have renamed the
              accounts, or don't have the same accounts on your machine, you
              could get misleading results. If the logs are enriched, it
              uses the supplemental data to do the conversion. This allows
              accurate log reporting even when run on a different machine
              than the original logs came from.

       <b>-if</b>, <b>--input </b><i>file-name</i> | <i>directory</i>
              Use the given <i>file</i> or <i>directory</i> instead of the logs. This is
              to aid analysis where the logs have been moved to another
              machine or only part of a log was saved.

       <b>--input-logs</b>
              Use the log file location from auditd.conf as input for
              searching. This is needed if you are using ausearch from a
              cron job.

       <b>--just-one</b>
              Stop after emitting the first event that matches the search
              criteria.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--key </b><i>key-string</i>
              Search for an event based on the given <i>key string</i>.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--line-buffered</b>
              Flush output on every line. Most useful when stdout is
              connected to a pipe and the default block buffering strategy
              is undesirable. May impose a performance penalty.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--message </b><i>message-type</i> | <i>comma-sep-message-type-list</i>
              Search for an event matching the given <i>message type</i>. (Message
              types are also known as record types.) You may also enter a
              <i>comma separated list of message types</i> or multiple individual
              message types each with its own <i>-m</i> option. There is an <b>ALL</b>
              message type that doesn't exist in the actual logs. It allows
              you to get all messages in the system. The list of valid
              messages types is long. The program will display the list
              whenever no message type is passed with this parameter. The
              message type can be either text or numeric. If you enter a
              list, there can be only commas and no spaces separating the
              list.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--node </b><i>node-name</i>
              Search for events originating from <i>node name</i> string. Multiple
              nodes are allowed, and if any nodes match, the event is
              matched.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--object </b><i>SE-Linux-context-string</i>
              Search for event with <i>tcontext</i> (object) matching the string.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pid </b><i>process-id</i>
              Search for an event matching the given <i>process ID</i>.

       <b>-pp</b>, <b>--ppid </b><i>parent-process-id</i>
              Search for an event matching the given <i>parent process ID</i>.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
              Output is completely unformatted. This is useful for
              extracting records to a file that can still be interpreted by
              audit tools or when piping to other audit tools.

       <b>-sc</b>, <b>--syscall </b><i>syscall-name-or-value</i>
              Search for an event matching the given <i>syscall</i>. You may either
              give the numeric syscall value or the syscall name. If you
              give the syscall name, it will use the syscall table for the
              machine that you are using.

       <b>-se</b>, <b>--context </b><i>SE-Linux-context-string</i>
              Search for event with either <i>scontext</i>/subject or
              <i>tcontext</i>/object matching the string.

       <b>--session </b><i>Login-Session-ID</i>
              Search for events matching the given Login Session ID. This
              process attribute is set when a user logs in and can tie any
              process to a particular user login.

       <b>-su</b>, <b>--subject </b><i>SE-Linux-context-string</i>
              Search for event with <i>scontext</i> (subject) matching the string.

       <b>-sv</b>, <b>--success </b><i>success-value</i>
              Search for an event matching the given <i>success value</i>. Legal
              values are <b>yes </b>and <b>no</b>.

       <b>-te</b>, <b>--end </b>[<i>end-date</i>] [<i>end-time</i>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or before the
              given end time. The format of end time depends on your locale.
              If the date is omitted, <b>today </b>is assumed. If the time is
              omitted, <b>now </b>is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM
              or PM to specify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8
              locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The date
              format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME environmental
              variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>boot</b>, <b>today</b>,
              <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>week-ago</b>, <b>this-month</b>, or <b>this-year</b>. <b>Now</b>
              means starting now. <b>Recent </b>is 10 minutes ago. <b>Boot </b>means the
              time of day to the second when the system last booted. <b>Today</b>
              means now. <b>Yesterday </b>is 1 second after midnight the previous
              day. <b>This-week </b>means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0
              of the week determined by your locale (see <b>localtime</b>).
              <b>Week-ago </b>means 1 second after midnight exactly 7 days ago.
              <b>This-month </b>means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the
              month. <b>This-year </b>means the 1 second after midnight on the
              first day of the first month.

       <b>-ts</b>, <b>--start </b>[<i>start-date</i>] [<i>start-time</i>]
              Search for events with time stamps equal to or after the given
              start time. The format of start time depends on your locale.
              If the date is omitted, <b>today </b>is assumed. If the time is
              omitted, <b>midnight </b>is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather
              than AM or PM to specify time. An example date using the
              en_US.utf8 locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is
              18:00:00. The date format accepted is influenced by the
              LC_TIME environmental variable.

              You may also use the word: <b>now</b>, <b>recent</b>, <b>boot</b>, <b>today</b>,
              <b>yesterday</b>, <b>this-week</b>, <b>week-ago</b>, <b>this-month</b>, <b>this-year</b>, or
              <b>checkpoint</b>. <b>Boot </b>means the time of day to the second when the
              system last booted. <b>Today </b>means starting at 1 second after
              midnight. <b>Recent </b>is 10 minutes ago. <b>Yesterday </b>is 1 second
              after midnight the previous day. <b>This-week </b>means starting 1
              second after midnight on day 0 of the week determined by your
              locale (see <b>localtime</b>). <b>Week-ago </b>means starting 1 second after
              midnight exactly 7 days ago. <b>This-month </b>means 1 second after
              midnight on day 1 of the month. <b>This-year </b>means the 1 second
              after midnight on the first day of the first month.

              <b>checkpoint </b>means <i>ausearch</i> will use the timestamp found within
              a valid checkpoint file ignoring the recorded inode, device,
              serial, node and event type also found within a checkpoint
              file. Essentially, this is the recovery action should an
              invocation of <i>ausearch</i> with a checkpoint option fail with an
              exit status of 10, 11 or 12. It could be used in a shell
              script something like:

                   ausearch --checkpoint /etc/audit/auditd_checkpoint.txt -i
                   _au_status=$?
                   if test ${_au_status} eq 10 -o ${_au_status} eq 11 -o ${_au_status} eq 12
                   then
                     ausearch --checkpoint /etc/audit/auditd_checkpoint.txt --start checkpoint -i
                   fi

       <b>-tm</b>, <b>--terminal </b><i>terminal</i>
              Search  for  an  event matching the given <i>terminal</i> value. Some
              daemons such as cron and atd  use  the  daemon  name  for  the
              terminal.

       <b>-ua</b>, <b>--uid-all </b><i>all-user-id</i>
              Search for an event with either user ID, effective user ID, or
              login user ID (auid) matching the given <i>user ID</i>.

       <b>-ue</b>, <b>--uid-effective </b><i>effective-user-id</i>
