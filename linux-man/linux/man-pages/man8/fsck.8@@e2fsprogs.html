       <b>fsck </b>is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file
       systems.  <i>filesys</i> can be a device name (e.g.  <i>/dev/hdc1</i>, <i>/dev/sdb2</i>),
       a mount point (e.g.  <i>/</i>, <i>/usr</i>, <i>/home</i>), or an ext2 label or UUID
       specifier (e.g.  UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or
       LABEL=root).  Normally, the <b>fsck </b>program will try to handle
       filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce
       the total amount of time needed to check all of the filesystems.

       If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the <b>-A</b>
       option is not specified, <b>fsck </b>will default to checking filesystems in
       <b>/etc/fstab </b>serially.  This is equivalent to the <b>-As </b>options.

       The exit code returned by <b>fsck </b>is the sum of the following
       conditions:
            0    - No errors
            1    - File system errors corrected
            2    - System should be rebooted
            4    - File system errors left uncorrected
            8    - Operational error
            16   - Usage or syntax error
            32   - Fsck canceled by user request
            128  - Shared library error
       The exit code returned when multiple file systems are checked is the
       bit-wise OR of the exit codes for each file system that is checked.

       In actuality, <b>fsck </b>is simply a front-end for the various file system
       checkers (<b>fsck</b>.<i>fstype</i>) available under Linux.  The file system-
       specific checker is searched for in <i>/sbin</i> first, then in <i>/etc/fs</i> and
       <i>/etc</i>, and finally in the directories listed in the PATH environment
       variable.  Please see the file system-specific checker manual pages
       for further details.

<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-s     </b>Serialize <b>fsck </b>operations.  This is a good idea if you are
              checking multiple filesystems and the checkers are in an
              interactive mode.  (Note: <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> runs in an interactive
              mode by default.  To make <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> run in a non-interactive
              mode, you must either specify the <b>-p </b>or <b>-a </b>option, if you wish
              for errors to be corrected automatically, or the <b>-n </b>option if
              you do not.)

       <b>-t </b><i>fslist</i>
              Specifies the type(s) of file system to be checked.  When the
              <b>-A </b>flag is specified, only filesystems that match <i>fslist</i> are
              checked.  The <i>fslist</i> parameter is a comma-separated list of
              filesystems and options specifiers.  All of the filesystems in
              this comma-separated list may be prefixed by a negation
              operator '<b>no</b>' or '<b>!</b>', which requests that only those
              filesystems not listed in <i>fslist</i> will be checked.  If all of
              the filesystems in <i>fslist</i> are not prefixed by a negation
              operator, then only those filesystems listed in <i>fslist</i> will be
              checked.

              Options specifiers may be included in the comma-separated
              <i>fslist</i>.  They must have the format <b>opts=</b><i>fs-option</i>.  If an
              options specifier is present, then only filesystems which
              contain <i>fs-option</i> in their mount options field of <b>/etc/fstab</b>
              will be checked.  If the options specifier is prefixed by a
              negation operator, then only those filesystems that do not
              have <i>fs-option</i> in their mount options field of <b>/etc/fstab </b>will
              be checked.

              For example, if <b>opts=ro </b>appears in <i>fslist</i>, then only
              filesystems listed in <b>/etc/fstab </b>with the <b>ro </b>option will be
              checked.

              For compatibility with Mandrake distributions whose boot
              scripts depend upon an unauthorized UI change to the <b>fsck</b>
              program, if a filesystem type of <b>loop </b>is found in <i>fslist</i>, it
              is treated as if <b>opts=loop </b>were specified as an argument to
              the <b>-t </b>option.

              Normally, the filesystem type is deduced by searching for
              <i>filesys</i> in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file and using the corresponding
              entry.  If the type can not be deduced, and there is only a
              single filesystem given as an argument to the <b>-t </b>option, <b>fsck</b>
              will use the specified filesystem type.  If this type is not
              available, then the default file system type (currently ext2)
              is used.

       <b>-A     </b>Walk through the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file and try to check all file
              systems in one run.  This option is typically used from the
              <i>/etc/rc</i> system initialization file, instead of multiple
              commands for checking a single file system.

              The root filesystem will be checked first unless the <b>-P </b>option
              is specified (see below).  After that, filesystems will be
              checked in the order specified by the <i>fs_passno</i> (the sixth)
              field in the <i>/etc/fstab</i> file.  Filesystems with a <i>fs_passno</i>
              value of 0 are skipped and are not checked at all.
              Filesystems with a <i>fs_passno</i> value of greater than zero will
              be checked in order, with filesystems with the lowest
              <i>fs_passno</i> number being checked first.  If there are multiple
              filesystems with the same pass number, fsck will attempt to
              check them in parallel, although it will avoid running
              multiple filesystem checks on the same physical disk.

              Hence, a very common configuration in <i>/etc/fstab</i> files is to
              set the root filesystem to have a <i>fs_passno</i> value of 1 and to
              set all other filesystems to have a <i>fs_passno</i> value of 2.
              This will allow <b>fsck </b>to automatically run filesystem checkers
              in parallel if it is advantageous to do so.  System
              administrators might choose not to use this configuration if
              they need to avoid multiple filesystem checks running in
              parallel for some reason --- for example, if the machine in
              question is short on memory so that excessive paging is a
              concern.

       <b>-C </b>[  <i>fd</i>  ]
              Display completion/progress bars for those filesystem checkers
              (currently only for ext2 and ext3) which support them.   Fsck
              will manage the filesystem checkers so that only one of them
              will display a progress bar at a time.  GUI front-ends may
              specify a file descriptor <i>fd</i>, in which case the progress bar
              information will be sent to that file descriptor.

       <b>-M     </b>Do not check mounted filesystems and return an exit code of 0
              for mounted filesystems.

       <b>-N     </b>Don't execute, just show what would be done.

       <b>-P     </b>When the <b>-A </b>flag is set, check the root filesystem in parallel
              with the other filesystems.  This is not the safest thing in
              the world to do, since if the root filesystem is in doubt
              things like the <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> executable might be corrupted!  This
              option is mainly provided for those sysadmins who don't want
              to repartition the root filesystem to be small and compact
              (which is really the right solution).

       <b>-R     </b>When checking all file systems with the <b>-A </b>flag, skip the root
              file system (in case it's already mounted read-write).

       <b>-T     </b>Don't show the title on startup.

       <b>-V     </b>Produce verbose output, including all file system-specific
              commands that are executed.

       <b>fs-specific-options</b>
              Options which are not understood by <b>fsck </b>are passed to the
              filesystem-specific checker.  These arguments <b>must </b>not take
              arguments, as there is no way for <b>fsck </b>to be able to properly
              guess which arguments take options and which don't.

              Options and arguments which follow the <b>-- </b>are treated as file
              system-specific options to be passed to the file system-
              specific checker.

              Please note that fsck is not designed to pass arbitrarily
              complicated options to filesystem-specific checkers.  If
              you're doing something complicated, please just execute the
              filesystem-specific checker directly.  If you pass <b>fsck </b>some
              horribly complicated option and arguments, and it doesn't do
              what you expect, <b>don't bother reporting it as a bug.  </b>You're
              almost certainly doing something that you shouldn't be doing
              with <b>fsck.</b>

       Options to different filesystem-specific fsck's are not standardized.
       If in doubt, please consult the man pages of the filesystem-specific
       checker.  Although not guaranteed, the following options are
       supported by most file system checkers:

       <b>-a     </b>Automatically repair the file system without any questions
              (use this option with caution).  Note that <a href="e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck(8)</a> supports
              <b>-a </b>for backwards compatibility only.  This option is mapped to
              <b>e2fsck</b>'s <b>-p </b>option which is safe to use, unlike the <b>-a </b>option
              that some file system checkers support.

       <b>-n     </b>For some filesystem-specific checkers, the <b>-n </b>option will
              cause the fs-specific fsck to avoid attempting to repair any
              problems, but simply report such problems to stdout.  This is
              however not true for all filesystem-specific checkers.  In
              particular, <b>fsck.reiserfs</b>(8) will not report any corruption if
              given this option.  <a href="fsck.minix.8.html">fsck.minix(8)</a> does not support the <b>-n</b>
              option at all.

       <b>-r     </b>Interactively repair the filesystem (ask for confirmations).
              Note: It is generally a bad idea to use this option if
              multiple fsck's are being run in parallel.  Also note that
              this is <b>e2fsck</b>'s default behavior; it supports this option for
              backwards compatibility reasons only.

       <b>-y     </b>For some filesystem-specific checkers, the <b>-y </b>option will
              cause the fs-specific fsck to always attempt to fix any
              detected filesystem corruption automatically.  Sometimes an
              expert may be able to do better driving the fsck manually.
              Note that <b>not </b>all filesystem-specific checkers implement this
              option.  In particular <a href="fsck.minix.8.html">fsck.minix(8)</a> and <a href="fsck.cramfs.8.html">fsck.cramfs(8)</a> does
              not support the <b>-y </b>option as of this writing.

<h2><a id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"></a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>fsck </b>program's behavior is affected by the following environment
       variables:

       <b>FSCK_FORCE_ALL_PARALLEL</b>
              If this environment variable is set, <b>fsck </b>will attempt to run
              all of the specified filesystems in parallel, regardless of
              whether the filesystems appear to be on the same device.
              (This is useful for RAID systems or high-end storage systems
              such as those sold by companies such as IBM or EMC.)

       <b>FSCK_MAX_INST</b>
              This environment variable will limit the maximum number of
              file system checkers that can be running at one time.  This
              allows configurations which have a large number of disks to
              avoid <b>fsck </b>starting too many file system checkers at once,
              which might overload CPU and memory resources available on the
              system.  If this value is zero, then an unlimited number of
              processes can be spawned.  This is currently the default, but
              future versions of <b>fsck </b>may attempt to automatically determine
              how many file system checks can be run based on gathering
              accounting data from the operating system.

       <b>PATH   </b>The <b>PATH </b>environment variable is used to find file system
              checkers.  A set of system directories are searched first:
              <b>/sbin</b>, <b>/sbin/fs.d</b>, <b>/sbin/fs</b>, <b>/etc/fs</b>, and <b>/etc</b>.  Then the set
              of directories found in the <b>PATH </b>environment are searched.

       <b>FSTAB_FILE</b>
              This environment variable allows the system administrator to
              override the standard location of the <b>/etc/fstab </b>file.  It is
              also useful for developers who are testing <b>fsck</b>.
