<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>man </b>macros used to generate <i>man pages</i> with <i>groff</i> were written by
       James Clark.  This document provides a brief summary of the use of
       each macro in that package.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>man </b>macros understand the following command line options (which
       define various registers).

       <b>-rcR=1 </b>This option (the default if in nroff mode) creates a single,
              very long page instead of multiple pages.  Say <b>-rcR=0 </b>to
              disable it.

       <b>-rC1   </b>If more than one manual page is given on the command line,
              number the pages continuously, rather than starting each at 1.

       <b>-rD1   </b>Double-sided printing.  Footers for even and odd pages are
              formatted differently.

       <b>-rFT=</b><i>dist</i>
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the page
              if negative or relative to the top if positive.  The default
              is -0.5i.

       <b>-rHY=</b><i>flags</i>
              Set hyphenation flags.  Possible values are 1 to hyphenate
              without restrictions, 2 to not hyphenate the last word on a
              page, 4 to not hyphenate the last two characters of a word,
              and 8 to not hyphenate the first two characters of a word.
              These values are additive; the default is 14.

       <b>-rIN=</b><i>width</i>
              Set body text indentation to <i>width</i>.  The default is 7n for
              <i>nroff</i>, 7.2n for <i>troff</i>.  For <i>nroff</i>, this value should always be
              an integer multiple of unit ‘n’ to get consistent indentation.

       <b>-rLL=</b><i>line-length</i>
              Set line length.  If this option is not given, the line length
              is set to respect any value set by a prior ‘.ll’ request
              (which <i>must</i> be in effect when the ‘.TH’ macro is invoked), if
              this differs from the built-in default for the formatter;
              otherwise it defaults to 78n in <i>nroff</i> mode and 6.5i in <i>troff</i>
              mode.

              Note that the use of a ‘.ll’ request to initialize the line
              length is supported for backward compatibility with some
              versions of the <b>man </b>program; direct initialization of the ‘LL’
              register should <i>always</i> be preferred to the use of such a
              request.  In particular, note that a ‘.ll 65n’ request does
              <i>not</i> preserve the normal <i>nroff</i> default line length, (the <b>man</b>
              default initialization to 78n prevails), whereas, the
              ‘-rLL=65n’ option, or an equivalent ‘.nr LL 65n’ request
              preceding the use of the ‘TH’ macro, <i>does</i> set a line length of
              65n.

       <b>-rLT=</b><i>title-length</i>
              Set title length.  If this option is not given, the title
              length defaults to the line length.

       <b>-rP</b><i>nnn</i> Enumeration of pages start with <i>nnn</i> rather than with 1.

       <b>-rS</b><i>xx</i>  Base document font size is <i>xx</i> points (<i>xx</i> can be 10, 11, or 12)
              rather than 10 points.

       <b>-rSN=</b><i>width</i>
              Set sub-subheading indentation to <i>width</i>.  The default is 3n.

       <b>-rX</b><i>nnn</i> After page <i>nnn</i>, number pages as <i>nnn</i>a, <i>nnn</i>b, <i>nnn</i>c, etc.  For
              example, the option ‘-rX2’ produces the following page
              numbers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.

<h2><a id="USAGE" href="#USAGE"></a>USAGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This section describes the available macros for manual pages.  For
       further customization, put additional macros and requests into the
       file <b>man.local</b>, which is loaded immediately after the <b>man </b>package.

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE    </b>Example/End Example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and the
              font is set to constant-width.  This is useful for formatting
              code, command, and configuration-file examples.  The <b>EE </b>macro
              restores filling and restores the previous font.

              These macros are defined on many (but not all) legacy Unix
              systems running classic troff.  To be certain your page will
              be portable to those systems, copy their definitions from the
              <b>an-ext.tmac </b>file of a <b>groff </b>installation.

       <b>.HP </b>[<i>nnn</i>]
              Set up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.  The
              indentation is set to <i>nnn</i> if that argument is supplied (the
              default unit is ‘n’ if omitted), otherwise it is set to the
              previous indentation value specified with <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, or <b>.HP </b>(or
              to the default value if none of them have been used yet).
              Font size and face are reset to its default values.  The
              following paragraph illustrates the effect of this macro with
              hanging indentation set to 4 (enclosed by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>to set
              the left margin temporarily to the current indentation):

              This is a paragraph following an invocation of the <b>HP </b>macro.
                  As you can see, it produces a paragraph where all lines
                  but the first are indented.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  While it
              is universally portable to legacy Unix systems, a hanging
              indentation cannot be expressed naturally under HTML, and many
              HTML-based manual viewers simply interpret it as a starter for
              a normal paragraph.  Thus, any information or distinction you
              tried to express with the indentation may be lost.

       <b>.IP </b>[<i>designator</i>] [<i>nnn</i>]
              Set up an indented paragraph, using <i>designator</i> as a tag to
              mark its beginning.  The indentation is set to <i>nnn</i> if that
              argument is supplied (the default unit is ‘n’ if omitted),
              otherwise it is set to the previous indentation value
              specified with <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, or <b>.HP </b>(or to the default value if
              none of them have been used yet).  Font size and face of the
              paragraph (but not the designator) are reset to its default
              values.

              To start an indented paragraph with a particular indentation
              but without a designator, use ‘""’ (two doublequotes) as the
              second argument.

              For example, the following paragraphs were all set up with
              bullets as the designator, using ‘.IP \(bu 4’.  The whole
              block has been enclosed with <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>to set the left
              margin temporarily to the current indentation value.

              ·   <b>IP </b>is one of the three macros used in the <b>man </b>package to
                  format lists.

              ·   <b>HP </b>is another.  This macro produces a paragraph with a
                  left hanging indentation.

              ·   <b>TP </b>is another.  This macro produces an unindented label
                  followed by an indented paragraph.

       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP</b>
       <b>.P     </b>These macros are mutual aliases.  Any of them causes a line
              break at the current position, followed by a vertical space
              downwards by the amount specified by the <b>PD </b>macro.  The font
              size and shape are reset to the default value (normally 10pt
              Roman).  Finally, the current left margin and the indentation
              is reset to the default values.

       <b>.RE </b>[<i>nnn</i>]
              This macro moves the left margin back to level <i>nnn</i>, restoring
              the previous left margin.  If no argument is given, it moves
              one level back.  The first level (i.e., no call to <b>.RS </b>yet)
              has number 1, and each call to <b>.RS </b>increases the level by 1.

       <b>.RS </b>[<i>nnn</i>]
              This macro moves the left margin to the right by the value <i>nnn</i>
              if specified (default unit is ‘n’); otherwise it is set to the
              previous indentation value specified with <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, or <b>.HP </b>(or
              to the default value if none of them have been used yet).  The
              indentation value is then set to the default.

              Calls to the <b>RS </b>macro can be nested.

       <b>.SH </b>[<i>text for a heading</i>]
              Set up an unnumbered section heading sticking out to the left.
              Prints out all the text following <b>.SH </b>up to the end of the
              line (or the text in the next input line if there is no
              argument to <b>.SH</b>) in bold face (or the font specified by the
              string <b>HF</b>), one size larger than the base document size.
              Additionally, the left margin and the indentation for the
              following text is reset to the default values.

       <b>.SS </b>[<i>text for a heading</i>]
              Set up a secondary, unnumbered section heading.  Prints out
              all the text following <b>.SS </b>up to the end of the line (or the
              text in the next input line if there is no argument to <b>.SS</b>) in
              bold face (or the font specified by the string <b>HF</b>), at the
              same size as the base document size.  Additionally, the left
              margin and the indentation for the following text is reset to
              the default values.

       <b>.TH </b><i>title section</i> [<i>extra1</i>] [<i>extra2</i>] [<i>extra3</i>]
              Set the title of the <i>man page</i> to <i>title</i> and the section to
              <i>section</i>, which must take on a value between 1 and 8.  The
              value <i>section</i> may also have a string appended, e.g. ‘.pm’, to
              indicate a specific subsection of the <i>man pages</i>.  Both <i>title</i>
              and <i>section</i> are positioned at the left and right in the header
              line (with <i>section</i> in parentheses immediately appended to
              <i>title</i>.  <i>extra1</i> is positioned in the middle of the footer line.
              <i>extra2</i> is positioned at the left in the footer line (or at the
              left on even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-
              sided printing is active).  <i>extra3</i> is centered in the header
              line.

              For HTML output, headers and footers are completely
              suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the new line
              number is 1 again (except if the ‘-rC1’ option is given on the
              command line) -- this feature is intended only for formatting
              multiple <i>man pages</i>; a single <i>man page</i> should contain exactly
              one <b>TH </b>macro at the beginning of the file.

       <b>.TP </b>[<i>nnn</i>]
              Set up an indented paragraph with label.  The indentation is
              set to <i>nnn</i> if that argument is supplied (the default unit is
              ‘n’ if omitted), otherwise it is set to the previous
              indentation value specified with <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, or <b>.HP </b>(or to the
              default value if none of them have been used yet).

              The first input line of text following this macro is
              interpreted as a string to be printed flush-left, as it is
              appropriate for a label.  It is not interpreted as part of a
              paragraph, so there is no attempt to fill the first line with
              text from the following input lines.  Nevertheless, if the
              label is not as wide as the indentation the paragraph starts
              at the same line (but indented), continuing on the following
              lines.  If the label is wider than the indentation the
              descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following
              the label, entirely indented.  Note that neither font shape
              nor font size of the label is set to a default value; on the
              other hand, the rest of the text has default font settings.

              The <b>TP </b>macro is the macro used for the explanations you are
              just reading.

       <b>.TQ    </b>The <b>TQ </b>macro sets up header continuation for a <b>TP </b>macro.  With
              it, you can stack up any number of labels (such as in a
              glossary, or list of commands) before beginning the indented
              paragraph.  For an example, look up the documentation of the
              <b>LP</b>, <b>PP</b>, and <b>P </b>macros.

              This macro is not defined on legacy Unix systems running
              classic troff.  To be certain your page will be portable to
              those systems, copy its definition from the <b>an-ext.tmac </b>file
              of a <b>groff </b>installation.

       To summarize, the following macros cause a line break with the
       insertion of vertical space (which amount can be changed with the <b>PD</b>
       macro): <b>SH</b>, <b>SS</b>, <b>TP</b>, <b>TQ</b>, <b>LP </b>(<b>PP</b>, <b>P</b>), <b>IP</b>, and <b>HP</b>.  The macros <b>RS</b>, <b>RE</b>,
       <b>EX</b>, and <b>EE </b>also cause a break but no insertion of vertical space.

       The standard font is Roman; the default text size is 10 point.

       <b>.B </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Causes <i>text</i> to appear in bold face.  If no text is present on
              the line where the macro is called the text of the next input
              line appears in bold face.

       <b>.BI </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in bold
              face and italic.  The text must be on the same line as the
              macro call.  Thus

                     .BI this "word and" that

              would cause ‘this’ and ‘that’ to appear in bold face, while
              ‘word and’ appears in italics.

       <b>.BR </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in bold
              face and roman.  The text must be on the same line as the
              macro call.

       <b>.I </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Causes <i>text</i> to appear in italic.  If no text is present on the
              line where the macro is called the text of the next input line
              appears in italic.

       <b>.IB </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text to appear alternately in italic and bold face.
              The text must be on the same line as the macro call.

       <b>.IR </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in italic
              and roman.  The text must be on the same line as the macro
              call.

       <b>.RB </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in roman
              and bold face.  The text must be on the same line as the macro
              call.

       <b>.RI </b><i>text</i>
              Causes text on the same line to appear alternately in roman
              and italic.  The text must be on the same line as the macro
              call.

       <b>.SB </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Causes the text on the same line or the text on the next input
              line to appear in boldface font, one point size smaller than
              the default font.

       <b>.SM </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Causes the text on the same line or the text on the next input
              line to appear in a font that is one point size smaller than
              the default font.

       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running
       classic troff.  To be certain your page will be portable to those
       systems, copy their definitions from the <b>an-ext.tmac </b>file of a <b>groff</b>
       installation.

       Using these macros helps ensure that you get hyperlinks when your
       manual page is rendered in a browser or other program that is Web-
       enabled.

       <b>.MT </b><i>address</i>
       <b>.ME </b>[<i>punctuation</i>]
              Wrap an email address.  The argument of <b>.MT </b>is the address;
              text following, until <b>.ME</b>, is a name to be associated with the
              address.  Any argument to the <b>ME </b>macro is pasted to the end of
              the link text.  On a device that is not a browser,

                     contact
                     .MT fred.foonly@\:fubar.net
                     Fred Foonly
                     .ME
                     for more information

              usually displays like this: “contact Fred Foonly &lt;fred.foonly@
              fubar.net&gt; for more information”.

              The use of <b>\: </b>to insert hyphenless breakpoints is a groff
              extension and can be omitted.

       <b>.UR </b><i>URL</i>
       <b>.UE </b>[<i>punctuation</i>]
              Wrap a World Wide Web hyperlink.  The argument to <b>.UR </b>is the
              URL; thereafter, lines until <b>.UE </b>are collected and used as the
              link text.  Any argument to the <b>UE </b>macro is pasted to the end
              of the text.  On a device that is not a browser,

                     this is a link to
                     .UR <a href="http://\:randomsite.org/\:fubar">http://\:randomsite.org/\:fubar</a>
                     some random site
                     .UE ,
                     given as an example

              usually displays like this: “this is a link to some random
              site &lt;<a href="http://randomsite.org/fubar">http://randomsite.org/fubar</a>&gt;, given as an example”.

       The following macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running
       classic troff.  To be certain your page will be portable to those
       systems, copy their definitions from the <b>an-ext.tmac </b>file of a <b>groff</b>
       installation.

       These macros are a convenience for authors.  They also assist
       automated translation tools and help browsers in recognizing command
       synopses and treating them differently from running text.

       <b>.OP </b><i>key value</i>
              Describe an optional command argument.  The arguments of this
              macro are set surrounded by option braces in the default Roman
              font; the first argument is printed with a bold face, while
              the second argument is typeset as italic.

       <b>.SY </b><i>command</i>
              Begin synopsis.  Takes a single argument, the name of a
              command.  Text following, until closed by <b>.YS</b>, is set with a
              hanging indentation with the width of <i>command</i> plus a space.
              This produces the traditional look of a Unix command synopsis.

       <b>.YS    </b>This macro restores normal indentation at the end of a command
              synopsis.

       Here is a real example:

              .SY groff
              .OP \-abcegiklpstzCEGNRSUVXZ
              .OP \-d cs
              .OP \-f fam
              .OP \-F dir
              .OP \-I dir
              .OP \-K arg
              .OP \-L arg
              .OP \-m name
              .OP \-M dir
              .OP \-n num
              .OP \-o list
              .OP \-P arg
              .OP \-r cn
              .OP \-T dev
              .OP \-w name
              .OP \-W name
              .RI [ file
              .IR .\|.\|. ]
              .YS

       produces the following output:

              <b>groff </b>[<b>-abcegiklpstzCEGNRSUVXZ</b>] [<b>-d </b><i>cs</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>fam</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>dir</i>]
                    [<b>-I </b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-K </b><i>arg</i>] [<b>-L </b><i>arg</i>] [<b>-m </b><i>name</i>] [<b>-M </b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>num</i>]
                    [<b>-o </b><i>list</i>] [<b>-P </b><i>arg</i>] [<b>-r </b><i>cn</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>dev</i>] [<b>-w </b><i>name</i>] [<b>-W </b><i>name</i>]
                    [<i>file ...</i>]

       If necessary, you might use <b>br </b>requests to control line breaking.
       You can insert plain text as well; this looks like the traditional
       (unornamented) syntax for a required command argument or filename.

<h2><a id="MISCELLANEOUS" href="#MISCELLANEOUS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The default indentation is 7.2n in troff mode and 7n in nroff mode
       except for <b>grohtml</b>, which ignores indentation.

       <b>.AT </b>[<i>system</i> [<i>release</i>]]
              Alter the footer for use with AT&amp;T <i>man pages</i>.  This command
              exists only for compatibility; don't use it.  See the <i>groff</i>
              info manual for more.

       <b>.BT    </b>Print the footer string.  Redefine this macro to get control
              of the footer.

       <b>.DT    </b>Set tabs every 0.5 inches.  Since this macro is always called
              during a <b>TH </b>macro, it makes sense to call it only if the tab
              positions have been changed.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact whitespace
              control and tabbing are not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.DT </b>to express are
              likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to use it, you should
              probably be composing a table using <a href="../man1/tbl.1.html">tbl(1)</a> markup instead.

       <b>.PD </b>[<i>nnn</i>]
              Adjust the empty space before a new paragraph or section.  The
              optional argument gives the amount of space (default unit is
              ‘v’); without parameter, the value is reset to its default
              value (1 line in nroff mode, 0.4v otherwise).  This affects
              the macros <b>SH</b>, <b>SS</b>, <b>TP</b>, <b>LP </b>(resp. <b>PP </b>and <b>P</b>), <b>IP</b>, and <b>HP</b>.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control of inter-
              paragraph spacing is not readily available.  Thus, information
              or distinctions that you use <b>.PD </b>to express are likely to be
              lost.

       <b>.PT    </b>Print the header string.  Redefine this macro to get control
              of the header.

       <b>.UC </b>[<i>version</i>]
              Alter the footer for use with BSD <i>man pages</i>.  This command
              exists only for compatibility; don't use it.  See the <i>groff</i>
              info manual for more.

       The following strings are defined:

       <b>\*R    </b>The ‘registered’ sign.

       <b>\*S    </b>Switch back to the default font size.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq  </b>Left and right quote.  This is equal to ‘\(lq’ and ‘\(rq\[cq],
              respectively.

       <b>\*(HF  </b>The typeface used to print headings and subheadings.  The
              default is ‘B’.

       <b>\*(Tm  </b>The ‘trademark’ sign.

       If a preprocessor like <b>tbl </b>or <b>eqn </b>is needed, it has become common to
       make the first line of the <i>man page</i> look like this:

              <b>'\" </b><i>word</i>

       Note the single space character after the double quote.  <i>word</i>
       consists of letters for the needed preprocessors: ‘e’ for <b>eqn</b>, ‘r’
       for <b>refer</b>, and ‘t’ for <b>tbl</b>.  Modern implementations of the <b>man</b>
       program read this first line and automatically call the right
       preprocessor(s).

<h2><a id="PORTABILITY_AND_TROFF_REQUESTS" href="#PORTABILITY_AND_TROFF_REQUESTS"></a>PORTABILITY AND TROFF REQUESTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Since the <b>man </b>macros consist of groups of <i>groff</i> requests, one can, in
       principle, supplement the functionality of the <b>man </b>macros with
       individual <i>groff</i> requests where necessary.  See the <i>groff</i> info pages
       for a complete reference of all requests.

       Note, however, that using raw troff requests is likely to make your
       page render poorly on the (increasingly common) class of viewers that
       render it to HTML.  Troff requests make implicit assumptions about
       things like character and page sizes that may break in an HTML
       environment; also, many of these viewers don't interpret the full
       troff vocabulary, a problem that can lead to portions of your text
       being silently dropped.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page
       entirely in the requests described on this page.  Further, it is best
       to completely avoid those we have described as ‘presentation-level’
       (<b>.HP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, and <b>.DT</b>).

       The macros we have described as extensions (<b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b>, <b>.SY</b>/<b>.OP</b>/<b>.YS</b>,
       <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>, and <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>) should be used with caution, as they may not
       yet be built in to some viewer that is important to your audience.
       If in doubt, copy the implementation onto your page.

       <b>andoc.tmac</b>
              Use this file in case you don't know whether the <b>man </b>macros or
              the <b>mdoc </b>package should be used.  Multiple man pages (in
              either format) can be handled.

       <b>an-old.tmac</b>
              Most <b>man </b>macros are contained in this file.

       <b>an-ext.tmac</b>
              The extension macro definitions for <b>.SY</b>, <b>.OP</b>, <b>.YS</b>, <b>.TQ</b>,
              <b>.EX/.EE</b>, <b>.UR/.UE</b>, and <b>.MT/.ME </b>are contained in this file.  It
              is written in classic troff, and released for free re-use, and
              not copylefted; manual page authors concerned about
              portability to legacy Unix systems are encouraged to copy
              these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of troff
              or its workalikes are encouraged to re-use them.

              Note that the definitions for these macros are read after the
              call of <b>TH</b>, so they will replace macros of the same names
              given at the beginning of your file.  If you must use your own
              definitions for these macros, they must be given after calling
              <b>TH</b>.

       <b>man.local</b>
              Local changes and customizations should be put into this file.
