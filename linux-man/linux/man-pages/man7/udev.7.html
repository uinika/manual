<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       udev supplies the system software with device events, manages
       permissions of device nodes and may create additional symlinks in the
       /dev directory, or renames network interfaces. The kernel usually
       just assigns unpredictable device names based on the order of
       discovery. Meaningful symlinks or network device names provide a way
       to reliably identify devices based on their properties or current
       configuration.

       The udev daemon, <a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service(8)</a>, receives device uevents
       directly from the kernel whenever a device is added or removed from
       the system, or it changes its state. When udev receives a device
       event, it matches its configured set of rules against various device
       attributes to identify the device. Rules that match may provide
       additional device information to be stored in the udev database or to
       be used to create meaningful symlink names.

       All device information udev processes is stored in the udev database
       and sent out to possible event subscribers. Access to all stored data
       and the event sources is provided by the library libudev.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RULES_FILES" href="#RULES_FILES"></a>RULES FILES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The udev rules are read from the files located in the system rules
       directory /usr/lib/udev/rules.d, the volatile runtime directory
       /run/udev/rules.d and the local administration directory
       /etc/udev/rules.d. All rules files are collectively sorted and
       processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which
       they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each
       other. Files in /etc have the highest priority, files in /run take
       precedence over files with the same name in /usr/lib. This can be
       used to override a system-supplied rules file with a local file if
       needed; a symlink in /etc with the same name as a rules file in
       /usr/lib, pointing to /dev/null, disables the rules file entirely.
       Rule files must have the extension .rules; other extensions are
       ignored.

       Every line in the rules file contains at least one key-value pair.
       Except for empty lines or lines beginning with "#", which are
       ignored. There are two kinds of keys: match and assignment. If all
       match keys match against their values, the rule gets applied and the
       assignment keys get the specified values assigned.

       A matching rule may rename a network interface, add symlinks pointing
       to the device node, or run a specified program as part of the event
       handling.

       A rule consists of a comma-separated list of one or more key-value
       pairs. Each key has a distinct operation, depending on the used
       operator. Valid operators are:

       "=="
           Compare for equality.

       "!="
           Compare for inequality.

       "="
           Assign a value to a key. Keys that represent a list are reset and
           only this single value is assigned.

       "+="
           Add the value to a key that holds a list of entries.

       "-="
           Remove the value from a key that holds a list of entries.

       ":="
           Assign a value to a key finally; disallow any later changes.

       The following key names can be used to match against device
       properties. Some of the keys also match against properties of the
       parent devices in sysfs, not only the device that has generated the
       event. If multiple keys that match a parent device are specified in a
       single rule, all these keys must match at one and the same parent
       device.

       <i>ACTION</i>
           Match the name of the event action.

       <i>DEVPATH</i>
           Match the devpath of the event device.

       <i>KERNEL</i>
           Match the name of the event device.

       <i>NAME</i>
           Match the name of a network interface. It can be used once the
           NAME key has been set in one of the preceding rules.

       <i>SYMLINK</i>
           Match the name of a symlink targeting the node. It can be used
           once a SYMLINK key has been set in one of the preceding rules.
           There may be multiple symlinks; only one needs to match.

       <i>SUBSYSTEM</i>
           Match the subsystem of the event device.

       <i>DRIVER</i>
           Match the driver name of the event device. Only set this key for
           devices which are bound to a driver at the time the event is
           generated.

       <i>ATTR{filename}</i>, <i>SYSCTL{kernel parameter}</i>
           Match sysfs attribute values of the event device. Trailing
           whitespace in the attribute values is ignored unless the
           specified match value itself contains trailing whitespace.  Match
           a kernel parameter value.

       <i>KERNELS</i>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device name.

       <i>SUBSYSTEMS</i>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device subsystem name.

       <i>DRIVERS</i>
           Search the devpath upwards for a matching device driver name.

       <i>ATTRS{filename}</i>
           Search the devpath upwards for a device with matching sysfs
           attribute values. If multiple <i>ATTRS</i> matches are specified, all of
           them must match on the same device. Trailing whitespace in the
           attribute values is ignored unless the specified match value
           itself contains trailing whitespace.

       <i>TAGS</i>
           Search the devpath upwards for a device with matching tag.

       <i>ENV{key}</i>
           Match against a device property value.

       <i>TAG</i>
           Match against a device tag.

       <i>TEST{octal mode mask}</i>
           Test the existence of a file. An octal mode mask can be specified
           if needed.

       <i>PROGRAM</i>
           Execute a program to determine whether there is a match; the key
           is true if the program returns successfully. The device
           properties are made available to the executed program in the
           environment. The program's standard output is available in the
           <i>RESULT</i> key.

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks.
           For details, see <i>RUN</i>.

       <i>RESULT</i>
           Match the returned string of the last <i>PROGRAM</i> call. This key can
           be used in the same or in any later rule after a <i>PROGRAM</i> call.

       Most of the fields support shell glob pattern matching and alternate
       patterns. The following special characters are supported:

       "*"
           Matches zero or more characters.

       "?"
           Matches any single character.

       "[]"
           Matches any single character specified within the brackets. For
           example, the pattern string "tty[SR]" would match either "ttyS"
           or "ttyR". Ranges are also supported via the "-" character. For
           example, to match on the range of all digits, the pattern "[0-9]"
           could be used. If the first character following the "[" is a "!",
           any characters not enclosed are matched.

       "|"
           Separates alternative patterns. For example, the pattern string
           "abc|x*" would match either "abc" or "x*".

       The following keys can get values assigned:

       <i>NAME</i>
           The name to use for a network interface. See <a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link(5)</a> for
           a higher-level mechanism for setting the interface name. The name
           of a device node cannot be changed by udev, only additional
           symlinks can be created.

       <i>SYMLINK</i>
           The name of a symlink targeting the node. Every matching rule
           adds this value to the list of symlinks to be created.

           The set of characters to name a symlink is limited. Allowed
           characters are "0-9A-Za-z#+-.:=@_/", valid UTF-8 character
           sequences, and "\x00" hex encoding. All other characters are
           replaced by a "_" character.

           Multiple symlinks may be specified by separating the names by the
           space character. In case multiple devices claim the same name,
           the link always points to the device with the highest
           link_priority. If the current device goes away, the links are
           re-evaluated and the device with the next highest link_priority
           becomes the owner of the link. If no link_priority is specified,
           the order of the devices (and which one of them owns the link) is
           undefined.

           Symlink names must never conflict with the kernel's default
           device node names, as that would result in unpredictable
           behavior.

       <i>OWNER</i>, <i>GROUP</i>, <i>MODE</i>
           The permissions for the device node. Every specified value
           overrides the compiled-in default value.

       <i>SECLABEL{module}</i>
           Applies the specified Linux Security Module label to the device
           node.

       <i>ATTR{key}</i>
           The value that should be written to a sysfs attribute of the
           event device.

       <i>SYSCTL{kernel parameter}</i>
           The value that should be written to kernel parameter.

       <i>ENV{key}</i>
           Set a device property value. Property names with a leading "."
           are neither stored in the database nor exported to events or
           external tools (run by, for example, the <i>PROGRAM</i> match key).

       <i>TAG</i>
           Attach a tag to a device. This is used to filter events for users
           of libudev's monitor functionality, or to enumerate a group of
           tagged devices. The implementation can only work efficiently if
           only a few tags are attached to a device. It is only meant to be
           used in contexts with specific device filter requirements, and
           not as a general-purpose flag. Excessive use might result in
           inefficient event handling.

       <i>RUN{type}</i>
           Add a program to the list of programs to be executed after
           processing all the rules for a specific event, depending on
           "type":

           "program"
               Execute an external program specified as the assigned value.
               If no absolute path is given, the program is expected to live
               in /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be
               specified.

               This is the default if no <i>type</i> is specified.

           "builtin"
               As <i>program</i>, but use one of the built-in programs rather than
               an external one.

           The program name and following arguments are separated by spaces.
           Single quotes can be used to specify arguments with spaces.

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks.
           Running an event process for a long period of time may block all
           further events for this or a dependent device.

           Starting daemons or other long-running processes is not
           appropriate for udev; the forked processes, detached or not, will
           be unconditionally killed after the event handling has finished.

       <i>LABEL</i>
           A named label to which a <i>GOTO</i> may jump.

       <i>GOTO</i>
           Jumps to the next <i>LABEL</i> with a matching name.

       <i>IMPORT{type}</i>
           Import a set of variables as device properties, depending on
           "type":

           "program"
               Execute an external program specified as the assigned value
               and, if it returns successfully, import its output, which
               must be in environment key format. Path specification,
               command/argument separation, and quoting work like in <i>RUN</i>.

           "builtin"
               Similar to "program", but use one of the built-in programs
               rather than an external one.

           "file"
               Import a text file specified as the assigned value, the
               content of which must be in environment key format.

           "db"
               Import a single property specified as the assigned value from
               the current device database. This works only if the database
               is already populated by an earlier event.

           "cmdline"
               Import a single property from the kernel command line. For
               simple flags the value of the property is set to "1".

           "parent"
               Import the stored keys from the parent device by reading the
               database entry of the parent device. The value assigned to
               <b>IMPORT{parent} </b>is used as a filter of key names to import
               (with the same shell glob pattern matching used for
               comparisons).

           This can only be used for very short-running foreground tasks.
           For details see <b>RUN</b>.

       <i>OPTIONS</i>
           Rule and device options:

           <b>link_priority=</b><i>value</i>
               Specify the priority of the created symlinks. Devices with
               higher priorities overwrite existing symlinks of other
               devices. The default is 0.

           <b>string_escape=</b><i>none|replace</i>
               Usually, control and other possibly unsafe characters are
               replaced in strings used for device naming. The mode of
               replacement can be specified with this option.

           <b>static_node=</b>
               Apply the permissions specified in this rule to the static
               device node with the specified name. Also, for every tag
               specified in this rule, create a symlink in the directory
               /run/udev/static_node-tags/<i>tag</i> pointing at the static device
               node with the specified name. Static device node creation is
               performed by systemd-tmpfiles before systemd-udevd is
               started. The static nodes might not have a corresponding
               kernel device; they are used to trigger automatic kernel
               module loading when they are accessed.

           <b>watch</b>
               Watch the device node with inotify; when the node is closed
               after being opened for writing, a change uevent is
               synthesized.

           <b>nowatch</b>
               Disable the watching of a device node with inotify.

       The <i>NAME</i>, <i>SYMLINK</i>, <i>PROGRAM</i>, <i>OWNER</i>, <i>GROUP</i>, <i>MODE</i>, <i>SECLABEL</i>, and <i>RUN</i>
       fields support simple string substitutions. The <i>RUN</i> substitutions are
       performed after all rules have been processed, right before the
       program is executed, allowing for the use of device properties set by
       earlier matching rules. For all other fields, substitutions are
       performed while the individual rule is being processed. The available
       substitutions are:

       <b>$kernel</b>, <b>%k</b>
           The kernel name for this device.

       <b>$number</b>, <b>%n</b>
           The kernel number for this device. For example, "sda3" has kernel
           number "3".

       <b>$devpath</b>, <b>%p</b>
           The devpath of the device.

       <b>$id</b>, <b>%b</b>
           The name of the device matched while searching the devpath
           upwards for <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>KERNELS</b>, <b>DRIVERS</b>, and <b>ATTRS</b>.

       <b>$driver</b>
           The driver name of the device matched while searching the devpath
           upwards for <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>KERNELS</b>, <b>DRIVERS</b>, and <b>ATTRS</b>.

       <b>$attr{</b><i>file</i><b>}</b>, <b>%s{</b><i>file</i><b>}</b>
           The value of a sysfs attribute found at the device where all keys
           of the rule have matched. If the matching device does not have
           such an attribute, and a previous <b>KERNELS</b>, <b>SUBSYSTEMS</b>, <b>DRIVERS</b>,
           or <b>ATTRS </b>test selected a parent device, then the attribute from
           that parent device is used.

           If the attribute is a symlink, the last element of the symlink
           target is returned as the value.

       <b>$env{</b><i>key</i><b>}</b>, <b>%E{</b><i>key</i><b>}</b>
           A device property value.

       <b>$major</b>, <b>%M</b>
           The kernel major number for the device.

       <b>$minor</b>, <b>%m</b>
           The kernel minor number for the device.

       <b>$result</b>, <b>%c</b>
           The string returned by the external program requested with
           <i>PROGRAM</i>. A single part of the string, separated by a space
           character, may be selected by specifying the part number as an
           attribute: "%c{N}". If the number is followed by the "+"
           character, this part plus all remaining parts of the result
           string are substituted: "%c{N+}".

       <b>$parent</b>, <b>%P</b>
           The node name of the parent device.

       <b>$name</b>
           The current name of the device. If not changed by a rule, it is
           the name of the kernel device.

       <b>$links</b>
           A space-separated list of the current symlinks. The value is only
           set during a remove event or if an earlier rule assigned a value.

       <b>$root</b>, <b>%r</b>
           The udev_root value.

       <b>$sys</b>, <b>%S</b>
           The sysfs mount point.

       <b>$devnode</b>, <b>%N</b>
           The name of the device node.

       <b>%%</b>
           The "%" character itself.

       <b>$$</b>
