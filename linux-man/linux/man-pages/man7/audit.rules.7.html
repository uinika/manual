       <b>audit.rules </b>is a file containing audit rules that will be loaded by
       the audit daemon's init script whenever the daemon is started. The
       auditctl program is used by the initscripts to perform this
       operation. The syntax for the rules is essentially the same as when
       typing in an auditctl command at a shell prompt except you do not
       need to type the auditctl command name since that is implied. The
       audit rules come in 3 varieties: <i>control</i>, <i>file</i>, and <i>syscall</i>.

   <b>Control</b>
       Control commands generally involve configuring the audit system
       rather than telling it what to watch for. These commands typically
       include deleting all rules, setting the size of the kernel's backlog
       queue, setting the failure mode, setting the event rate limit, or to
       tell auditctl to ignore syntax errors in the rules and continue
       loading. Generally, these rules are at the top of the rules file.

   <b>File System</b>
       File System rules are sometimes called watches. These rules are used
       to audit access to particular files or directories that you may be
       interested in. If the path given in the rule is a directory, then the
       rule used is recursive to the bottom of the directory tree excluding
       any directories that may be mount points. The syntax of these rules
       generally follow this format:

       <b>-w path-to-file -p permissions -k keyname</b>

       where the permission are any one of the following:

              <b>r </b>- read of the file

              <b>w </b>- write to the file

              <b>x </b>- execute the file

              <b>a </b>- change in the file's attribute

   <b>System Call</b>
       The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that
       intercepts each syscall that all programs on the system makes.
       Therefore it is very important to only use syscall rules when you
       have to since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger
       the performance hit. You can help the performance, though, by
       combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

       The Linux kernel has 4 rule matching lists or filters as they are
       sometimes called. They are: task, exit, user, and exclude. The task
       list is checked only during the fork or clone syscalls. It is rarely
       used in practice.

       The exit filter is the place where all syscall and file system audit
       requests are evaluated.

       The user filter is used to filter (remove) some events that originate
       in user space.  By default, any event originating in user space is
       allowed. So, if there are some events that you do not want to see,
       then this is a place where some can be removed. See auditctl(8) for
       fields that are valid.

       The exclude filter is used to exclude certain events from being
       emitted. The msgtype field is used to tell the kernel which message
       types you do not want to record. This filter can remove the event as
       a whole and is not selective about any other attribute. The user and
       exit filters are better suited to selectively auditing events.

       Syscall rules take the general form of:

       <b>-a action,list -S syscall -F field=value -k keyname</b>

       The <b>-a </b>option tells the kernel's rule matching engine that we want to
       append a rule at the end of the rule list. But we need to specify
       which rule list it goes on and what action to take when it triggers.
       Valid actions are:

              <b>always </b>- always create an event

              <b>never  </b>- never create an event

       The action and list are separated by a comma but no space in between.
       Valid lists are: <i>task</i>, <i>exit</i>, <i>user</i>, and <i>exclude</i>. Their meaning was
       explained earlier.

       Next in the rule would normally be the <b>-S </b>option. This field can
       either be the syscall name or number. For readability, the name is
       almost always used. You may give more than one syscall in a rule by
       specifying another <b>-S </b>option. When sent into the kernel, all syscall
       fields are put into a mask so that one compare can determine if the
       syscall is of interest. So, adding multiple syscalls in one rule is
       very efficient. When you specify a syscall name, auditctl will look
       up the name and get its syscall number. This leads to some problems
       on bi-arch machines. The 32 and 64 bit syscall numbers sometimes, but
       not always, line up. So, to solve this problem, you would generally
       need to break the rule into 2 with one specifying -F arch=b32 and the
       other specifying -F arch=b64. This needs to go in front of the <b>-S</b>
       option so that auditctl looks at the right lookup table when
       returning the number.

       After the syscall is specified, you would normally have one or more
       <b>-F </b>options that fine tune what to match against. Rather than list all
       the valid field types here, the reader should look at the auditctl
       man page which has a full listing of each field and what it means.
       But it's worth mentioning a couple things.

       The audit system considers uids to be unsigned numbers. The audit
       system uses the number -1 to indicate that a loginuid is not set.
       This means that when it's printed out, it looks like 4294967295. If
       you write a rule that you wanted try to get the valid users of the
       system, you need to look in /etc/login.defs to see where user
       accounts start. For example, if UID_MIN is  500, then you would also
       need to take into account that the unsigned representation of -1 is
       higher than 500. So you would address this with the following piece
       of a rule:

       -F auid&gt;=500 -F auid!=4294967295

       These individual checks are "anded" and both have to be true.

       The last thing to know about syscall rules is that you can add a key
       field which is a free form text string that you want inserted into
       the event to help identify its meaning. This is discussed in more
       detail in the NOTES section.

       The purpose of auditing is to be able to do an investigation
       periodically or whenever an incident occurs. A few simple steps in
       planning up front will make this job easier. The best advice is to
       use keys in both the watches and system call rules to give the rule a
       meaning. If rules are related or together meet a specific
       requirement, then give them a common key name. You can use this
       during your investigation to select only results with a specific
       meaning.

       When doing an investigation, you would normally start off with the
       main aureport output to just get an idea about what is happening on
       the system. This report mostly tells you about events that are hard
       coded by the audit system such as login/out, uses of authentication,
       system anomalies, how many users have been on the machine, and if SE
       Linux has detected any AVCs.

       aureport --start this-week

       After looking at the report, you probably want to get a second view
       about what rules you loaded that have been triggering. This is where
       keys become important. You would generally run the key summary report
       like this:

       aureport --start this-week --key --summary

       This will give an ordered listing of the keys associated with rules
       that have been triggering. If, for example, you had a syscall audit
       rule that triggered on the failure to open files with EPERM that had
       a key field of access like this:

       -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -S openat -F exit=-EPERM -k access

       Then you can isolate these failures with ausearch and pipe the
       results to aureport for display. Suppose your investigation noticed a
       lot of the access denied events. If you wanted to see the files that
       unauthorized access has been attempted, you could run the following
       command:

       ausearch --start this-week -k access --raw | aureport --file --summary

       This will give an ordered list showing which files are being accessed
       with the EPERM failure. Suppose you wanted to see which users might
       be having failed access, you would run the following command:

       ausearch --start this-week -k access --raw | aureport --user --summary

       If your investigation showed a lot of failed accesses to a particular
       file, you could run the following report to see who is doing it:

       ausearch --start this-week -k access -f /path-to/file --raw |
       aureport --user -i

       This report will give you the individual access attempts by person.
       If you needed to see the actual audit event that is being reported,
       you would look at the date, time, and event columns. Assuming the
       event was 822 and it occurred at 2:30 on 09/01/2009 and you use the
       en_US.utf8 locale, the command would look something like this:

       ausearch --start 09/01/2009 02:30 -a 822 -i --just-one

       This will select the first event from that day and time with the
       matching event id and interpret the numeric values into human
       readable values.

       The most important step in being able to do this kind of analysis is
       setting up key fields when the rules were originally written. It
       should also be pointed out that you can have more than one key field
       associated with any given rule.

       If you are not getting events on syscall rules that you think you
       should, try running a test program under strace so that you can see
       the syscalls. There is a chance that you might have identified the
       wrong syscall.

       If you get a warning from auditctl saying, "32/64 bit syscall
       mismatch in line XX, you should specify an arch". This means that you
       specified a syscall rule on a bi-arch system where the syscall has a
       different syscall number for the 32 and 64 bit interfaces. This means
       that on one of those interfaces you are likely auditing the wrong
       syscall. To solve the problem, re-write the rule as two rules
       specifying the intended arch for each rule. For example,

       -always,exit -S openat -k access

       would be rewritten as

       -always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -k access
       -always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -k access

       If you get a warning that says, "entry rules deprecated, changing to
       exit rule". This means that you have a rule intended for the entry
       filter, but that filter is no longer available. Auditctl moved your
       rule to the exit filter so that it's not lost. But to solve this so
       that you do not get the warning any more, you need to change the
       offending rule from entry to exit.

       The following rule shows how to audit failed access to files due to
       permission problems. Note that it takes two rules for each arch ABI
       to audit this since file access can fail with two different failure
       codes indicating permission problems.

       <b>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open -S openat -F exit=-EACCES -k access</b>
       <b>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open -S openat -F exit=-EPERM -k access</b>
       <b>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -S openat -F exit=-EACCES -k access</b>
       <b>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -S openat -F exit=-EPERM -k access</b>
