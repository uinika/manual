       This manual page describes the Linux networking socket layer user
       interface.  The BSD compatible sockets are the uniform interface
       between the user process and the network protocol stacks in the
       kernel.  The protocol modules are grouped into <i>protocol families</i> such
       as <b>AF_INET</b>, <b>AF_IPX</b>, and <b>AF_PACKET</b>, and <i>socket types</i> such as
       <b>SOCK_STREAM </b>or <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>.  See <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> for more information on
       families and types.

   <b>Socket-layer functions</b>
       These functions are used by the user process to send or receive
       packets and to do other socket operations.  For more information see
       their respective manual pages.

       <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> creates a socket, <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> connects a socket to a remote
       socket address, the <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> function binds a socket to a local socket
       address, <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen(2)</a> tells the socket that new connections shall be
       accepted, and <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a> is used to get a new socket with a new
       incoming connection.  <a href="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair(2)</a> returns two connected anonymous
       sockets (implemented only for a few local families like <b>AF_UNIX</b>)

       <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> send data over a socket, and
       <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/recvfrom.2.html">recvfrom(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a> receive data from a socket.  <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>
       and <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> wait for arriving data or a readiness to send data.  In
       addition, the standard I/O operations like <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/writev.2.html">writev(2)</a>,
       <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/readv.2.html">readv(2)</a> can be used to read and write
       data.

       <a href="../man2/getsockname.2.html">getsockname(2)</a> returns the local socket address and <a href="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername(2)</a>
       returns the remote socket address.  <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a>
       are used to set or get socket layer or protocol options.  <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
       can be used to set or read some other options.

       <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a> is used to close a socket.  <a href="../man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown(2)</a> closes parts of a
       full-duplex socket connection.

       Seeking, or calling <a href="../man2/pread.2.html">pread(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/pwrite.2.html">pwrite(2)</a> with a nonzero position is
       not supported on sockets.

       It is possible to do nonblocking I/O on sockets by setting the
       <b>O_NONBLOCK </b>flag on a socket file descriptor using <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.  Then all
       operations that would block will (usually) return with <b>EAGAIN</b>
       (operation should be retried later); <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> will return
       <b>EINPROGRESS </b>error.  The user can then wait for various events via
       <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>.

       An alternative to <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> is to let the kernel inform
       the application about events via a <b>SIGIO </b>signal.  For that the
       <b>O_ASYNC </b>flag must be set on a socket file descriptor via <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> and
       a valid signal handler for <b>SIGIO </b>must be installed via <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>.
       See the <i>Signals</i> discussion below.

   <b>Socket address structures</b>
       Each socket domain has its own format for socket addresses, with a
       domain-specific address structure.  Each of these structures begins
       with an integer "family" field (typed as <i>sa_family_t</i>) that indicates
       the type of the address structure.  This allows the various system
       calls (e.g., <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/getsockname.2.html">getsockname(2)</a>,
       <a href="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername(2)</a>), which are generic to all socket domains, to
       determine the domain of a particular socket address.

       To allow any type of socket address to be passed to interfaces in the
       sockets API, the type <i>struct sockaddr</i> is defined.  The purpose of
       this type is purely to allow casting of domain-specific socket
       address types to a "generic" type, so as to avoid compiler warnings
       about type mismatches in calls to the sockets API.

       In addition, the sockets API provides the data type <i>struct</i>
       <i>sockaddr_storage</i>.  This type is suitable to accommodate all supported
       domain-specific socket address structures; it is large enough and is
       aligned properly.  (In particular, it is large enough to hold IPv6
       socket addresses.)  The structure includes the following field, which
       can be used to identify the type of socket address actually stored in
       the structure:

               sa_family_t ss_family;

       The <i>sockaddr_storage</i> structure is useful in programs that must handle
       socket addresses in a generic way (e.g., programs that must deal with
       both IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses).

   <b>Socket options</b>
       The socket options listed below can be set by using <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> and
       read with <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> with the socket level set to <b>SOL_SOCKET </b>for
       all sockets.  Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a pointer to an <i>int</i>.

       <b>SO_ACCEPTCONN</b>
              Returns a value indicating whether or not this socket has been
              marked to accept connections with <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen(2)</a>.  The value 0
              indicates that this is not a listening socket, the value 1
              indicates that this is a listening socket.  This socket option
              is read-only.

       <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER </b>(since Linux 2.2), <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF </b>(since Linux 3.19)
              Attach a classic BPF (<b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b>) or an extended BPF
              (<b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>) program to the socket for use as a filter of
              incoming packets.  A packet will be dropped if the filter
              program returns zero.  If the filter program returns a non-
              zero value which is less than the packet's data length, the
              packet will be truncated to the length returned.  If the value
              returned by the filter is greater than or equal to the
              packet's data length, the packet is allowed to proceed
              unmodified.

              The argument for <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER </b>is a <i>sock_fprog</i> structure,
              defined in <i>&lt;linux/filter.h&gt;</i>:

                  struct sock_fprog {
                      unsigned short      len;
                      struct sock_filter *filter;
                  };

              The argument for <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF </b>is a file descriptor returned
              by the <a href="../man2/bpf.2.html">bpf(2)</a> system call and must refer to a program of type
              <b>BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER.</b>

              These options may be set multiple times for a given socket,
              each time replacing the previous filter program.  The classic
              and extended versions may be called on the same socket, but
              the previous filter will always be replaced such that a socket
              never has more than one filter defined.

              Both classic and extended BPF are explained in the kernel
              source file <i>Documentation/networking/filter.txt</i>

       <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>, <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b>
              For use with the <b>SO_REUSEPORT </b>option, these options allow the
              user to set a classic BPF (<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF</b>) or an
              extended BPF (<b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF</b>) program which defines
              how packets are assigned to the sockets in the reuseport group
              (that is, all sockets which have <b>SO_REUSEPORT </b>set and are
              using the same local address to receive packets).

              The BPF program must return an index between 0 and N-1
              representing the socket which should receive the packet (where
              N is the number of sockets in the group).  If the BPF program
              returns an invalid index, socket selection will fall back to
              the plain <b>SO_REUSEPORT </b>mechanism.

              Sockets are numbered in the order in which they are added to
              the group (that is, the order of <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> calls for UDP sockets
              or the order of <a href="../man2/listen.2.html">listen(2)</a> calls for TCP sockets).  New sockets
              added to a reuseport group will inherit the BPF program.  When
              a socket is removed from a reuseport group (via <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>), the
              last socket in the group will be moved into the closed
              socket's position.

              These options may be set repeatedly at any time on any socket
              in the group to replace the current BPF program used by all
              sockets in the group.

              <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF </b>takes the same argument type as
              <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER </b>and <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF </b>takes the same
              argument type as <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF.</b>

              UDP support for this feature is available since Linux 4.5; TCP
              support is available since Linux 4.6.

       <b>SO_BINDTODEVICE</b>
              Bind this socket to a particular device like “eth0”, as
              specified in the passed interface name.  If the name is an
              empty string or the option length is zero, the socket device
              binding is removed.  The passed option is a variable-length
              null-terminated interface name string with the maximum size of
              <b>IFNAMSIZ</b>.  If a socket is bound to an interface, only packets
              received from that particular interface are processed by the
              socket.  Note that this works only for some socket types,
              particularly <b>AF_INET </b>sockets.  It is not supported for packet
              sockets (use normal <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> there).

              Before Linux 3.8, this socket option could be set, but could
              not retrieved with <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a>.  Since Linux 3.8, it is
              readable.  The <i>optlen</i> argument should contain the buffer size
              available to receive the device name and is recommended to be
              <b>IFNAMSZ </b>bytes.  The real device name length is reported back
              in the <i>optlen</i> argument.

       <b>SO_BROADCAST</b>
              Set or get the broadcast flag.  When enabled, datagram sockets
              are allowed to send packets to a broadcast address.  This
              option has no effect on stream-oriented sockets.

       <b>SO_BSDCOMPAT</b>
              Enable BSD bug-to-bug compatibility.  This is used by the UDP
              protocol module in Linux 2.0 and 2.2.  If enabled, ICMP errors
              received for a UDP socket will not be passed to the user
              program.  In later kernel versions, support for this option
              has been phased out: Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux
              2.6 generates a kernel warning (printk()) if a program uses
              this option.  Linux 2.0 also enabled BSD bug-to-bug
              compatibility options (random header changing, skipping of the
              broadcast flag) for raw sockets with this option, but that was
              removed in Linux 2.2.

       <b>SO_DEBUG</b>
              Enable socket debugging.  Allowed only for processes with the
              <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN </b>capability or an effective user ID of 0.

       <b>SO_DETACH_FILTER </b>(since Linux 2.2), <b>SO_DETACH_BPF </b>(since Linux 3.19)
              These two options, which are synonyms, may be used to remove
              the classic or extended BPF program attached to a socket with
              either <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER </b>or <b>SO_ATTACH_BPF</b>.  The option value is
              ignored.

       <b>SO_DOMAIN </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Retrieves the socket domain as an integer, returning a value
              such as <b>AF_INET6</b>.  See <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> for details.  This socket
              option is read-only.

       <b>SO_ERROR</b>
              Get and clear the pending socket error.  This socket option is
              read-only.  Expects an integer.

       <b>SO_DONTROUTE</b>
              Don't send via a gateway, send only to directly connected
              hosts.  The same effect can be achieved by setting the
              <b>MSG_DONTROUTE </b>flag on a socket <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a> operation.  Expects an
              integer boolean flag.

       <b>SO_INCOMING_CPU </b>(gettable since Linux 3.19, settable since Linux 4.4)
              Sets or gets the CPU affinity of a socket.  Expects an integer
              flag.

                  int cpu = 1;
                  socklen_t len = sizeof(cpu);
                  setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_INCOMING_CPU, &amp;cpu, &amp;len);

              Because all of the packets for a single stream (i.e., all
              packets for the same 4-tuple) arrive on the single RX queue
              that is associated with a particular CPU, the typical use case
              is to employ one listening process per RX queue, with the
              incoming flow being handled by a listener on the same CPU that
              is handling the RX queue.  This provides optimal NUMA behavior
              and keeps CPU caches hot.

       <b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b>
              Enable sending of keep-alive messages on connection-oriented
              sockets.  Expects an integer boolean flag.

       <b>SO_LINGER</b>
              Sets or gets the <b>SO_LINGER </b>option.  The argument is a <i>linger</i>
              structure.

                  struct linger {
                      int l_onoff;    /* linger active */
                      int l_linger;   /* how many seconds to linger for */
                  };

              When enabled, a <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown(2)</a> will not return until
              all queued messages for the socket have been successfully sent
              or the linger timeout has been reached.  Otherwise, the call
              returns immediately and the closing is done in the background.
              When the socket is closed as part of <a href="../man2/exit.2.html">exit(2)</a>, it always
              lingers in the background.

       <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER</b>
              When set, this option will prevent changing the filters
              associated with the socket.  These filters include any set
              using the socket options <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER, SO_ATTACH_BPF,</b>
              <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF </b>and <b>SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EPBF</b>.

              The typical use case is for a privileged process to set up a
              raw socket (an operation that requires the <b>CAP_NET_RAW</b>
              capability), apply a restrictive filter, set the
              <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER </b>option, and then either drop its privileges or
              pass the socket file descriptor to an unprivileged process via
              a UNIX domain socket.

              Once the <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER </b>option has been enabled, attempts to
              change or remove the filter attached to a socket, or to
              disable the <b>SO_LOCK_FILTER </b>option will fail with the error
              <b>EPERM</b>.

       <b>SO_MARK </b>(since Linux 2.6.25)
              Set the mark for each packet sent through this socket (similar
              to the netfilter MARK target but socket-based).  Changing the
              mark can be used for mark-based routing without netfilter or
              for packet filtering.  Setting this option requires the
              <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN </b>capability.

       <b>SO_OOBINLINE</b>
              If this option is enabled, out-of-band data is directly placed
              into the receive data stream.  Otherwise, out-of-band data is
              passed only when the <b>MSG_OOB </b>flag is set during receiving.

       <b>SO_PASSCRED</b>
              Enable or disable the receiving of the <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS </b>control
              message.  For more information see <a href="unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>.

       <b>SO_PEEK_OFF </b>(since Linux 3.4)
              This option, which is currently supported only for <a href="unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>
              sockets, sets the value of the "peek offset" for the <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>
              system call when used with <b>MSG_PEEK </b>flag.

              When this option is set to a negative value (it is set to -1
              for all new sockets), traditional behavior is provided:
              <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> with the <b>MSG_PEEK </b>flag will peek data from the front
              of the queue.

              When the option is set to a value greater than or equal to
              zero, then the next peek at data queued in the socket will
              occur at the byte offset specified by the option value.  At
              the same time, the "peek offset" will be incremented by the
              number of bytes that were peeked from the queue, so that a
              subsequent peek will return the next data in the queue.

              If data is removed from the front of the queue via a call to
              <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> (or similar) without the <b>MSG_PEEK </b>flag, the "peek
              offset" will be decreased by the number of bytes removed.  In
              other words, receiving data without the <b>MSG_PEEK </b>flag will
              cause the "peek offset" to be adjusted to maintain the correct
              relative position in the queued data, so that a subsequent
              peek will retrieve the data that would have been retrieved had
              the data not been removed.

              For datagram sockets, if the "peek offset" points to the
              middle of a packet, the data returned will be marked with the
              <b>MSG_TRUNC </b>flag.

              The following example serves to illustrate the use of
              <b>SO_PEEK_OFF</b>.  Suppose a stream socket has the following queued
              input data:

                  aabbccddeeff

              The following sequence of <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a> calls would have the effect
              noted in the comments:

                  int ov = 4;                  // Set peek offset to 4
                  setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEEK_OFF, &amp;ov, sizeof(ov));

                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "cc"; offset set to 6
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "dd"; offset set to 8
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, 0);         // Reads "aa"; offset set to 6
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "ee"; offset set to 8

       <b>SO_PEERCRED</b>
              Return the credentials of the foreign process connected to
              this socket.  This is possible only for connected <b>AF_UNIX</b>
              stream sockets and <b>AF_UNIX </b>stream and datagram socket pairs
              created using <a href="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair(2)</a>; see <a href="unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>.  The returned
              credentials are those that were in effect at the time of the
              call to <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/socketpair.2.html">socketpair(2)</a>.  The argument is a <i>ucred</i>
              structure; define the <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>feature test macro to obtain
              the definition of that structure from <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>.  This
              socket option is read-only.

       <b>SO_PRIORITY</b>
              Set the protocol-defined priority for all packets to be sent
              on this socket.  Linux uses this value to order the networking
              queues: packets with a higher priority may be processed first
              depending on the selected device queueing discipline.  Setting
              a priority outside the range 0 to 6 requires the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
              capability.

       <b>SO_PROTOCOL </b>(since Linux 2.6.32)
              Retrieves the socket protocol as an integer, returning a value
              such as <b>IPPROTO_SCTP</b>.  See <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> for details.  This socket
              option is read-only.

       <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>
              Sets or gets the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes.  The
              kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping
              overhead) when it is set using <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a>, and this doubled
              value is returned by <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a>.  The default value is set
              by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default</i> file, and the maximum
              allowed value is set by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</i> file.
              The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 256.

       <b>SO_RCVBUFFORCE </b>(since Linux 2.6.14)
              Using this socket option, a privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process
              can perform the same task as <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>, but the <i>rmem_max</i> limit
              can be overridden.

       <b>SO_RCVLOWAT </b>and <b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>
              Specify the minimum number of bytes in the buffer until the
              socket layer will pass the data to the protocol (<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>)
              or the user on receiving (<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>).  These two values are
              initialized to 1.  <b>SO_SNDLOWAT </b>is not changeable on Linux
              (<a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> fails with the error <b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>).  <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>
              is changeable only since Linux 2.4.  The <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>
              system calls currently do not respect the <b>SO_RCVLOWAT </b>setting
              on Linux, and mark a socket readable when even a single byte
              of data is available.  A subsequent read from the socket will
              block until <b>SO_RCVLOWAT </b>bytes are available.

       <b>SO_RCVTIMEO </b>and <b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b>
              Specify the receiving or sending timeouts until reporting an
              error.  The argument is a <i>struct timeval</i>.  If an input or
              output function blocks for this period of time, and data has
              been sent or received, the return value of that function will
              be the amount of data transferred; if no data has been
              transferred and the timeout has been reached, then -1 is
              returned with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>, or
              <b>EINPROGRESS </b>(for <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>) just as if the socket was
              specified to be nonblocking.  If the timeout is set to zero
              (the default), then the operation will never timeout.
              Timeouts only have effect for system calls that perform socket
              I/O (e.g., <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a>); timeouts
              have no effect for <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>, and so
              on.

       <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b>
              Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied
              in a <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> call should allow reuse of local addresses.  For
              <b>AF_INET </b>sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when
              there is an active listening socket bound to the address.
              When the listening socket is bound to <b>INADDR_ANY </b>with a
              specific port then it is not possible to bind to this port for
              any local address.  Argument is an integer boolean flag.

       <b>SO_REUSEPORT </b>(since Linux 3.9)
              Permits multiple <b>AF_INET </b>or <b>AF_INET6 </b>sockets to be bound to an
              identical socket address.  This option must be set on each
              socket (including the first socket) prior to calling <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a>
              on the socket.  To prevent port hijacking, all of the
              processes binding to the same address must have the same
              effective UID.  This option can be employed with both TCP and
              UDP sockets.

              For TCP sockets, this option allows <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a> load
              distribution in a multi-threaded server to be improved by
              using a distinct listener socket for each thread.  This
              provides improved load distribution as compared to traditional
              techniques such using a single <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a>ing thread that
              distributes connections, or having multiple threads that
              compete to <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a> from the same socket.

              For UDP sockets, the use of this option can provide better
              distribution of incoming datagrams to multiple processes (or
              threads) as compared to the traditional technique of having
              multiple processes compete to receive datagrams on the same
              socket.

       <b>SO_RXQ_OVFL </b>(since Linux 2.6.33)
              Indicates that an unsigned 32-bit value ancillary message
              (cmsg) should be attached to received skbs indicating the
              number of packets dropped by the socket between the last
              received packet and this received packet.

       <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>
              Sets or gets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes.  The
              kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping
              overhead) when it is set using <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a>, and this doubled
              value is returned by <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a>.  The default value is set
              by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default</i> file and the maximum
              allowed value is set by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</i> file.
              The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 2048.

       <b>SO_SNDBUFFORCE </b>(since Linux 2.6.14)
              Using this socket option, a privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process
              can perform the same task as <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>, but the <i>wmem_max</i> limit
              can be overridden.

       <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b>
              Enable or disable the receiving of the <b>SO_TIMESTAMP </b>control
              message.  The timestamp control message is sent with level
              <b>SOL_SOCKET </b>and the <i>cmsg_data</i> field is a <i>struct timeval</i>
              indicating the reception time of the last packet passed to the
              user in this call.  See <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a> for details on control
              messages.

       <b>SO_TYPE</b>
              Gets the socket type as an integer (e.g., <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>).  This
              socket option is read-only.

       <b>SO_BUSY_POLL </b>(since Linux 3.11)
              Sets the approximate time in microseconds to busy poll on a
              blocking receive when there is no data.  Increasing this value
              requires <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>.  The default for this option is
              controlled by the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/busy_read</i> file.

              The value in the <i>/proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll</i> file determines
              how long <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> will busy poll when they
              operate on sockets with <b>SO_BUSY_POLL </b>set and no events to
              report are found.

              In both cases, busy polling will only be done when the socket
              last received data from a network device that supports this
              option.

              While busy polling may improve latency of some applications,
              care must be taken when using it since this will increase both
              CPU utilization and power usage.

   <b>Signals</b>
       When writing onto a connection-oriented socket that has been shut
       down (by the local or the remote end) <b>SIGPIPE </b>is sent to the writing
       process and <b>EPIPE </b>is returned.  The signal is not sent when the write
       call specified the <b>MSG_NOSIGNAL </b>flag.

       When requested with the <b>FIOSETOWN fcntl</b>(2) or <b>SIOCSPGRP ioctl</b>(2),
       <b>SIGIO </b>is sent when an I/O event occurs.  It is possible to use
       <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a> in the signal handler to find out which socket
       the event occurred on.  An alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a
       real-time signal using the <b>F_SETSIG fcntl</b>(2); the handler of the real
       time signal will be called with the file descriptor in the <i>si_fd</i>
       field of its <i>siginfo_t</i>.  See <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for more information.

       Under some circumstances (e.g., multiple processes accessing a single
       socket), the condition that caused the <b>SIGIO </b>may have already
       disappeared when the process reacts to the signal.  If this happens,
       the process should wait again because Linux will resend the signal
       later.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       The core socket networking parameters can be accessed via files in
       the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/core/</i>.

       <i>rmem_default</i>
              contains the default setting in bytes of the socket receive
              buffer.

       <i>rmem_max</i>
              contains the maximum socket receive buffer size in bytes which
              a user may set by using the <b>SO_RCVBUF </b>socket option.

       <i>wmem_default</i>
              contains the default setting in bytes of the socket send
              buffer.

       <i>wmem_max</i>
              contains the maximum socket send buffer size in bytes which a
              user may set by using the <b>SO_SNDBUF </b>socket option.

       <i>message_cost</i> and <i>message_burst</i>
              configure the token bucket filter used to load limit warning
              messages caused by external network events.

       <i>netdev_max_backlog</i>
              Maximum number of packets in the global input queue.

       <i>optmem_max</i>
              Maximum length of ancillary data and user control data like
              the iovecs per socket.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       These operations can be accessed using <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>:

           <i>error</i> <b>= ioctl(</b><i>ip_socket</i><b>, </b><i>ioctl_type</i><b>, </b><i>&amp;value_result</i><b>);</b>

       <b>SIOCGSTAMP</b>
              Return a <i>struct timeval</i> with the receive timestamp of the last
              packet passed to the user.  This is useful for accurate round
              trip time measurements.  See <a href="../man2/setitimer.2.html">setitimer(2)</a> for a description of
              <i>struct timeval</i>.  This ioctl should be used only if the socket
              option <b>SO_TIMESTAMP </b>is not set on the socket.  Otherwise, it
              returns the timestamp of the last packet that was received
              while <b>SO_TIMESTAMP </b>was not set, or it fails if no such packet
              has been received, (i.e., <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> returns -1 with <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set
              to <b>ENOENT</b>).

       <b>SIOCSPGRP</b>
              Set the process or process group that is to receive <b>SIGIO </b>or
              <b>SIGURG </b>signals when I/O becomes possible or urgent data is
              available.  The argument is a pointer to a <i>pid_t</i>.  For further
              details, see the description of <b>F_SETOWN </b>in <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

       <b>FIOASYNC</b>
              Change the <b>O_ASYNC </b>flag to enable or disable asynchronous I/O
              mode of the socket.  Asynchronous I/O mode means that the
              <b>SIGIO </b>signal or the signal set with <b>F_SETSIG </b>is raised when a
              new I/O event occurs.

              Argument is an integer boolean flag.  (This operation is
              synonymous with the use of <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> to set the <b>O_ASYNC </b>flag.)

       <b>SIOCGPGRP</b>
              Get the current process or process group that receives <b>SIGIO</b>
              or <b>SIGURG </b>signals, or 0 when none is set.

       Valid <a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> operations:

       <b>FIOGETOWN</b>
              The same as the <b>SIOCGPGRP ioctl</b>(2).

       <b>FIOSETOWN</b>
              The same as the <b>SIOCSPGRP ioctl</b>(2).

       <b>SO_BINDTODEVICE </b>was introduced in Linux 2.0.30.  <b>SO_PASSCRED </b>is new
       in Linux 2.2.  The <i>/proc</i> interfaces were introduced in Linux 2.2.
       <b>SO_RCVTIMEO </b>and <b>SO_SNDTIMEO </b>are supported since Linux 2.3.41.
       Earlier, timeouts were fixed to a protocol-specific setting, and
       could not be read or written.

<h2><a id="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer is used for
       internal kernel structures; thus the values in the corresponding
       <i>/proc</i> files are twice what can be observed on the wire.

       Linux will allow port reuse only with the <b>SO_REUSEADDR </b>option when
       this option was set both in the previous program that performed a
       <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> to the port and in the program that wants to reuse the port.
       This differs from some implementations (e.g., FreeBSD) where only the
       later program needs to set the <b>SO_REUSEADDR </b>option.  Typically this
       difference is invisible, since, for example, a server program is
       designed to always set this option.
