       Packet sockets are used to receive or send raw packets at the device
       driver (OSI Layer 2) level.  They allow the user to implement
       protocol modules in user space on top of the physical layer.

       The <i>socket_type</i> is either <b>SOCK_RAW </b>for raw packets including the
       link-level header or <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>for cooked packets with the link-
       level header removed.  The link-level header information is available
       in a common format in a <i>sockaddr_ll</i> structure.  <i>protocol</i> is the IEEE
       802.3 protocol number in network byte order.  See the
       <i>&lt;linux/if_ether.h&gt;</i> include file for a list of allowed protocols.
       When protocol is set to <b>htons(ETH_P_ALL)</b>, then all protocols are
       received.  All incoming packets of that protocol type will be passed
       to the packet socket before they are passed to the protocols
       implemented in the kernel.

       In order to create a packet socket, a process must have the
       <b>CAP_NET_RAW </b>capability in the user namespace that governs its network
       namespace.

       <b>SOCK_RAW </b>packets are passed to and from the device driver without any
       changes in the packet data.  When receiving a packet, the address is
       still parsed and passed in a standard <i>sockaddr_ll</i> address structure.
       When transmitting a packet, the user-supplied buffer should contain
       the physical-layer header.  That packet is then queued unmodified to
       the network driver of the interface defined by the destination
       address.  Some device drivers always add other headers.  <b>SOCK_RAW </b>is
       similar to but not compatible with the obsolete <b>AF_INET/SOCK_PACKET</b>
       of Linux 2.0.

       <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>operates on a slightly higher level.  The physical header
       is removed before the packet is passed to the user.  Packets sent
       through a <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>packet socket get a suitable physical-layer
       header based on the information in the <i>sockaddr_ll</i> destination
       address before they are queued.

       By default, all packets of the specified protocol type are passed to
       a packet socket.  To get packets only from a specific interface use
       <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> specifying an address in a <i>struct sockaddr_ll</i> to bind the
       packet socket to an interface.  Fields used for binding are
       <i>sll_family</i> (should be <b>AF_PACKET</b>), <i>sll_protocol</i>, and <i>sll_ifindex</i>.

       The <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> operation is not supported on packet sockets.

       When the <b>MSG_TRUNC </b>flag is passed to <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/recv.2.html">recv(2)</a>, or
       <a href="../man2/recvfrom.2.html">recvfrom(2)</a>, the real length of the packet on the wire is always
       returned, even when it is longer than the buffer.

   <b>Address types</b>
       The <i>sockaddr_ll</i> structure is a device-independent physical-layer
       address.

           struct sockaddr_ll {
               unsigned short sll_family;   /* Always AF_PACKET */
               unsigned short sll_protocol; /* Physical-layer protocol */
               int            sll_ifindex;  /* Interface number */
               unsigned short sll_hatype;   /* ARP hardware type */
               unsigned char  sll_pkttype;  /* Packet type */
               unsigned char  sll_halen;    /* Length of address */
               unsigned char  sll_addr[8];  /* Physical-layer address */
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       *  <i>sll_protocol</i> is the standard ethernet protocol type in network
          byte order as defined in the <i>&lt;linux/if_ether.h&gt;</i> include file.  It
          defaults to the socket's protocol.

       *  <i>sll_ifindex</i> is the interface index of the interface (see
          <a href="netdevice.7.html">netdevice(7)</a>); 0 matches any interface (only permitted for
          binding).  <i>sll_hatype</i> is an ARP type as defined in the
          <i>&lt;linux/if_arp.h&gt;</i> include file.

       *  <i>sll_pkttype</i> contains the packet type.  Valid types are <b>PACKET_HOST</b>
          for a packet addressed to the local host, <b>PACKET_BROADCAST </b>for a
          physical-layer broadcast packet, <b>PACKET_MULTICAST </b>for a packet
          sent to a physical-layer multicast address, <b>PACKET_OTHERHOST </b>for a
          packet to some other host that has been caught by a device driver
          in promiscuous mode, and <b>PACKET_OUTGOING </b>for a packet originating
          from the local host that is looped back to a packet socket.  These
          types make sense only for receiving.

       *  <i>sll_addr</i> and <i>sll_halen</i> contain the physical-layer (e.g., IEEE
          802.3) address and its length.  The exact interpretation depends
          on the device.

       When you send packets, it is enough to specify <i>sll_family</i>, <i>sll_addr</i>,
       <i>sll_halen</i>, <i>sll_ifindex</i>, and <i>sll_protocol</i>.  The other fields should be
       0.  <i>sll_hatype</i> and <i>sll_pkttype</i> are set on received packets for your
       information.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       Packet socket options are configured by calling <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> with
       level <b>SOL_PACKET</b>.

       <b>PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>
       <b>PACKET_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</b>
              Packet sockets can be used to configure physical-layer
              multicasting and promiscuous mode.  <b>PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP </b>adds
              a binding and <b>PACKET_DROP_MEMBERSHIP </b>drops it.  They both
              expect a <i>packet_mreq</i> structure as argument:

                  struct packet_mreq {
                      int            mr_ifindex;    /* interface index */
                      unsigned short mr_type;       /* action */
                      unsigned short mr_alen;       /* address length */
                      unsigned char  mr_address[8]; /* physical-layer address */
                  };

              <i>mr_ifindex</i> contains the interface index for the interface
              whose status should be changed.  The <i>mr_type</i> field specifies
              which action to perform.  <b>PACKET_MR_PROMISC </b>enables receiving
              all packets on a shared medium (often known as "promiscuous
              mode"), <b>PACKET_MR_MULTICAST </b>binds the socket to the physical-
              layer multicast group specified in <i>mr_address</i> and <i>mr_alen</i>, and
              <b>PACKET_MR_ALLMULTI </b>sets the socket up to receive all multicast
              packets arriving at the interface.

              In addition, the traditional ioctls <b>SIOCSIFFLAGS</b>,
              <b>SIOCADDMULTI</b>, <b>SIOCDELMULTI </b>can be used for the same purpose.

       <b>PACKET_AUXDATA </b>(since Linux 2.6.21)
              If this binary option is enabled, the packet socket passes a
              metadata structure along with each packet in the <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>
              control field.  The structure can be read with <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a>.  It is
              defined as

                  struct tpacket_auxdata {
                      __u32 tp_status;
                      __u32 tp_len;      /* packet length */
                      __u32 tp_snaplen;  /* captured length */
                      __u16 tp_mac;
                      __u16 tp_net;
                      __u16 tp_vlan_tci;
                      __u16 tp_padding;
                  };

       <b>PACKET_FANOUT </b>(since Linux 3.1)
              To scale processing across threads, packet sockets can form a
              fanout group.  In this mode, each matching packet is enqueued
              onto only one socket in the group.  A socket joins a fanout
              group by calling <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> with level <b>SOL_PACKET </b>and
              option <b>PACKET_FANOUT</b>.  Each network namespace can have up to
              65536 independent groups.  A socket selects a group by
              encoding the ID in the first 16 bits of the integer option
              value.  The first packet socket to join a group implicitly
              creates it.  To successfully join an existing group,
              subsequent packet sockets must have the same protocol, device
              settings, fanout mode and flags (see below).  Packet sockets
              can leave a fanout group only by closing the socket.  The
              group is deleted when the last socket is closed.

              Fanout supports multiple algorithms to spread traffic between
              sockets, as follows:

              *  The default mode, <b>PACKET_FANOUT_HASH</b>, sends packets from
                 the same flow to the same socket to maintain per-flow
                 ordering.  For each packet, it chooses a socket by taking
                 the packet flow hash modulo the number of sockets in the
                 group, where a flow hash is a hash over network-layer
                 address and optional transport-layer port fields.

              *  The load-balance mode <b>PACKET_FANOUT_LB </b>implements a round-
                 robin algorithm.

              *  <b>PACKET_FANOUT_CPU </b>selects the socket based on the CPU that
                 the packet arrived on.

              *  <b>PACKET_FANOUT_ROLLOVER </b>processes all data on a single
                 socket, moving to the next when one becomes backlogged.

              *  <b>PACKET_FANOUT_RND </b>selects the socket using a pseudo-random
                 number generator.

              *  <b>PACKET_FANOUT_QM </b>(available since Linux 3.14) selects the
                 socket using the recorded queue_mapping of the received
                 skb.

              Fanout modes can take additional options.  IP fragmentation
              causes packets from the same flow to have different flow
              hashes.  The flag <b>PACKET_FANOUT_FLAG_DEFRAG</b>, if set, causes
              packets to be defragmented before fanout is applied, to
              preserve order even in this case.  Fanout mode and options are
              communicated in the second 16 bits of the integer option
              value.  The flag <b>PACKET_FANOUT_FLAG_ROLLOVER </b>enables the roll
              over mechanism as a backup strategy: if the original fanout
              algorithm selects a backlogged socket, the packet rolls over
              to the next available one.

       <b>PACKET_LOSS </b>(with <b>PACKET_TX_RING</b>)
              When a malformed packet is encountered on a transmit ring, the
              default is to reset its <i>tp_status</i> to <b>TP_STATUS_WRONG_FORMAT</b>
              and abort the transmission immediately.  The malformed packet
              blocks itself and subsequently enqueued packets from being
              sent.  The format error must be fixed, the associated
              <i>tp_status</i> reset to <b>TP_STATUS_SEND_REQUEST</b>, and the
              transmission process restarted via <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a>.  However, if
              <b>PACKET_LOSS </b>is set, any malformed packet will be skipped, its
              <i>tp_status</i> reset to <b>TP_STATUS_AVAILABLE</b>, and the transmission
              process continued.

       <b>PACKET_RESERVE </b>(with <b>PACKET_RX_RING</b>)
              By default, a packet receive ring writes packets immediately
              following the metadata structure and alignment padding.  This
              integer option reserves additional headroom.

       <b>PACKET_RX_RING</b>
              Create a memory-mapped ring buffer for asynchronous packet
              reception.  The packet socket reserves a contiguous region of
              application address space, lays it out into an array of packet
              slots and copies packets (up to <i>tp_snaplen</i>) into subsequent
              slots.  Each packet is preceded by a metadata structure
              similar to <i>tpacket_auxdata</i>.  The protocol fields encode the
              offset to the data from the start of the metadata header.
              <i>tp_net</i> stores the offset to the network layer.  If the packet
              socket is of type <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>, then <i>tp_mac</i> is the same.  If it
              is of type <b>SOCK_RAW</b>, then that field stores the offset to the
              link-layer frame.  Packet socket and application communicate
              the head and tail of the ring through the <i>tp_status</i> field.
              The packet socket owns all slots with <i>tp_status</i> equal to
              <b>TP_STATUS_KERNEL</b>.  After filling a slot, it changes the status
              of the slot to transfer ownership to the application.  During
              normal operation, the new <i>tp_status</i> value has at least the
              <b>TP_STATUS_USER </b>bit set to signal that a received packet has
              been stored.  When the application has finished processing a
              packet, it transfers ownership of the slot back to the socket
              by setting <i>tp_status</i> equal to <b>TP_STATUS_KERNEL</b>.

              Packet sockets implement multiple variants of the packet ring.
              The implementation details are described in
              <i>Documentation/networking/packet_mmap.txt</i> in the Linux kernel
              source tree.

       <b>PACKET_STATISTICS</b>
              Retrieve packet socket statistics in the form of a structure

                  struct tpacket_stats {
                      unsigned int tp_packets;  /* Total packet count */
                      unsigned int tp_drops;    /* Dropped packet count */
                  };

              Receiving statistics resets the internal counters.  The
              statistics structure differs when using a ring of variant
              <b>TPACKET_V3</b>.

       <b>PACKET_TIMESTAMP </b>(with <b>PACKET_RX_RING</b>; since Linux 2.6.36)
              The packet receive ring always stores a timestamp in the
              metadata header.  By default, this is a software generated
              timestamp generated when the packet is copied into the ring.
              This integer option selects the type of timestamp.  Besides
              the default, it support the two hardware formats described in
              <i>Documentation/networking/timestamping.txt</i> in the Linux kernel
              source tree.

       <b>PACKET_TX_RING </b>(since Linux 2.6.31)
              Create a memory-mapped ring buffer for packet transmission.
              This option is similar to <b>PACKET_RX_RING </b>and takes the same
              arguments.  The application writes packets into slots with
              <i>tp_status</i> equal to <b>TP_STATUS_AVAILABLE </b>and schedules them for
              transmission by changing <i>tp_status</i> to <b>TP_STATUS_SEND_REQUEST</b>.
              When packets are ready to be transmitted, the application
              calls <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a> or a variant thereof.  The <i>buf</i> and <i>len</i> fields of
              this call are ignored.  If an address is passed using
              <a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a>, then that overrides the socket
              default.  On successful transmission, the socket resets
              <i>tp_status</i> to <b>TP_STATUS_AVAILABLE</b>.  It immediately aborts the
              transmission on error unless <b>PACKET_LOSS </b>is set.

       <b>PACKET_VERSION </b>(with <b>PACKET_RX_RING</b>; since Linux 2.6.27)
              By default, <b>PACKET_RX_RING </b>creates a packet receive ring of
              variant <b>TPACKET_V1</b>.  To create another variant, configure the
              desired variant by setting this integer option before creating
              the ring.

       <b>PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS </b>(since Linux 3.14)
              By default, packets sent through packet sockets pass through
              the kernel's qdisc (traffic control) layer, which is fine for
              the vast majority of use cases.  For traffic generator
              appliances using packet sockets that intend to brute-force
              flood the network—for example, to test devices under load in a
              similar fashion to pktgen—this layer can be bypassed by
              setting this integer option to 1.  A side effect is that
              packet buffering in the qdisc layer is avoided, which will
              lead to increased drops when network device transmit queues
              are busy; therefore, use at your own risk.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       <b>SIOCGSTAMP </b>can be used to receive the timestamp of the last received
       packet.  Argument is a <i>struct timeval</i> variable.

       In addition, all standard ioctls defined in <a href="netdevice.7.html">netdevice(7)</a> and
       <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> are valid on packet sockets.

   <b>Error handling</b>
       Packet sockets do no error handling other than errors occurred while
       passing the packet to the device driver.  They don't have the concept
       of a pending error.

       <b>AF_PACKET </b>is a new feature in Linux 2.2.  Earlier Linux versions
       supported only <b>SOCK_PACKET</b>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       For portable programs it is suggested to use <b>AF_PACKET </b>via pcap(3);
       although this covers only a subset of the <b>AF_PACKET </b>features.

       The <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>packet sockets make no attempt to create or parse the
       IEEE 802.2 LLC header for a IEEE 802.3 frame.  When <b>ETH_P_802_3 </b>is
       specified as protocol for sending the kernel creates the 802.3 frame
       and fills out the length field; the user has to supply the LLC header
       to get a fully conforming packet.  Incoming 802.3 packets are not
       multiplexed on the DSAP/SSAP protocol fields; instead they are
       supplied to the user as protocol <b>ETH_P_802_2 </b>with the LLC header
       prefixed.  It is thus not possible to bind to <b>ETH_P_802_3</b>; bind to
       <b>ETH_P_802_2 </b>instead and do the protocol multiplex yourself.  The
       default for sending is the standard Ethernet DIX encapsulation with
       the protocol filled in.

       Packet sockets are not subject to the input or output firewall
       chains.

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       In Linux 2.0, the only way to get a packet socket was with the call:

           socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, protocol)

       This is still supported, but deprecated and strongly discouraged.
       The main difference between the two methods is that <b>SOCK_PACKET </b>uses
       the old <i>struct sockaddr_pkt</i> to specify an interface, which doesn't
       provide physical-layer independence.

           struct sockaddr_pkt {
               unsigned short spkt_family;
               unsigned char  spkt_device[14];
               unsigned short spkt_protocol;
           };

       <i>spkt_family</i> contains the device type, <i>spkt_protocol</i> is the IEEE 802.3
       protocol type as defined in <i>&lt;sys/if_ether.h&gt;</i> and <i>spkt_device</i> is the
       device name as a null-terminated string, for example, eth0.

       This structure is obsolete and should not be used in new code.

       The IEEE 802.2/803.3 LLC handling could be considered as a bug.

       Socket filters are not documented.

       The <b>MSG_TRUNC recvmsg</b>(2) extension is an ugly hack and should be
       replaced by a control message.  There is currently no way to get the
       original destination address of packets via <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>.
