       <i>roff</i> is the general name for a set of text formatting programs, known
       under names like <b>troff</b>, <b>nroff</b>, <b>ditroff</b>, <b>groff</b>, etc.  A <i>roff</i> system
       consists of an extensible text formatting language and a set of
       programs for printing and converting to other text formats.  Unix-
       like operating systems distribute a <i>roff</i> system as a core package.

       The most common <i>roff</i> system today is the free software implementation
       GNU <i>roff</i>, <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>.  <i>groff</i> implements the look-and-feel and
       functionality of its ancestors, with many extensions.

       The ancestry of <i>roff</i> is described in section <b>HISTORY</b>.  In this
       document, the term <i>roff</i> always refers to the general class of roff
       programs, not to the <b>roff </b>command provided in early UNIX systems.

       In spite of its age, <i>roff</i> is in wide use today, for example, the
       manual pages on UNIX systems (<i>man pages</i>), many software books, system
       documentation, standards, and corporate documents are written in
       roff.  The <i>roff</i> output for text devices is still unmatched, and its
       graphical output has the same quality as other free type-setting
       programs and is better than some of the commercial systems.

       <i>roff</i> is used to format UNIX <i>manual pages</i>, (or <i>man pages</i>), the
       standard documentation system on many UNIX-derived operating systems.

       This document describes the history of the development of the <i>roff</i>
       <i>system</i>; some usage aspects common to all <i>roff</i> versions, details on
       the <i>roff</i> pipeline, which is usually hidden behind front-ends like
       <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>; a general overview of the formatting language; some tips
       for editing <i>roff</i> files; and many pointers to further readings.

<h2><a id="HISTORY" href="#HISTORY"></a>HISTORY  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Document formatting by computer dates back to the 1960s.  The <i>roff</i>
       system itself is intimately connected to the Unix operating system,
       but its roots go back to the earlier operating systems CTSS and
       Multics.

   <b>The Predecessor RUNOFF</b>
       <b>roff</b>'s ancestor <b>RUNOFF </b>was written in the MAD language by <i>Jerry</i>
       <i>Saltzer</i> for the <i>Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS)</i>, a project of
       the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 1963 and 1964 –
       note that CTSS commands were all uppercase.

       In 1965, MIT's Project MAC teamed with Bell Telephone Laboratories
       (BTL) and General Electric to begin the <i>Multics</i> system 
       ⟨<a href="http://www.multicians.org/">http://www.multicians.org</a>⟩.  A command called <b>runoff </b>was written for
       Multics in the late 60s in the BCPL language, by <i>Bob Morris</i>, <i>Doug</i>
       <i>McIlroy</i>, and other members of the Multics team.

       Like its CTSS ancestor, Multics <b>runoff </b>formatted an input file con‐
       sisting of text and command lines; commands began with a period and
       were two letters.  Output from these commands was to terminal devices
       such as IBM Selectric terminals.  Multics <b>runoff </b>had additional fea‐
       tures added, such as the ability to do two-pass formatting; it became
       the main format for Multics documentation and text processing.

       BCPL and <b>runoff </b>were ported to the GCOS system at Bell Labs when BTL
       left the development of Multics.

       There is a free archive about <i>historical RUNOFF</i> documents.  You can
       get it anonymously by the shell command
              $git clone <a href="https://github.com/bwarken/RUNOFF_historical.git">https://github.com/bwarken/RUNOFF_historical.git</a>

       As well, there is a new project for writing a program that can read
       <i>RUNOFF files ,</i> but it does not yet work so far.  You can get an early
       version anonymously by the shell command
              $git clone <a href="https://github.com/bwarken/runoff.git">https://github.com/bwarken/runoff.git</a>

   <b>The Classical nroff/troff System</b>
       At BTL, there was a need to drive the <i>Graphic Systems CAT</i> typesetter,
       a graphical output device from a PDP-11 computer running Unix.  As
       <b>runoff </b>was too limited for this task it was further developed into a
       more powerful text formatting system by <i>Joseph F. Ossanna</i>, who
       already programmed several runoff ports.

       The name <i>runoff</i> was shortened to <i>roff</i>.  The greatly enlarged language
       of Ossanna's version already included all elements of a full <i>roff</i>
       <i>system</i>.  All modern <i>roff</i> systems try to implement compatibility to
       this system.  So Joe Ossanna can be called the father of all <i>roff</i>
       systems.

       This first <i>roff system</i> had three formatter programs.

       <b>troff  </b>(<i>typesetter roff</i>) generated a graphical output for the <i>CAT</i>
              typesetter as its only device.

       <b>nroff  </b>produced text output suitable for terminals and line printers.

       <b>roff   </b>was the reimplementation of the former <b>runoff </b>program with its
              limited features; this program was abandoned in later ver‐
              sions.  Today, the name <i>roff</i> is used to refer to a <i>troff/nroff</i>
              system as a whole.

       Ossanna's first version was written in the PDP-11 assembly language
       and released in 1973.  <i>Brian Kernighan</i> joined the <i>roff</i> development by
       rewriting it in the C programming language.  The C version was
       released in 1975.

       The syntax of the formatting language of the <b>nroff</b>/<b>troff </b>programs was
       documented in the famous <i>Troff User's Manual [CSTR #54]</i>, first pub‐
       lished in 1976, with further revisions up to 1992 by Brian Kernighan.
       This document is the specification of the <i>classical troff</i>.  All later
       <i>roff</i> systems tried to establish compatibility with this specifica‐
       tion.

       After Ossanna's death in 1977, Kernighan went on with developing
       <i>troff</i>.  In the late 1970s, Kernighan equipped <i>troff</i> with a general
       interface to support more devices, the intermediate output format,
       and the postprocessor system.  This completed the structure of a <i>roff</i>
       <i>system</i> as it is still in use today; see section <b>USING ROFF</b>.  In 1979,
       these novelties were described in the paper <i>[CSTR #97]</i>.  This new
       <i>troff</i> version is the basis for all existing newer troff systems,
       including <i>groff</i>.  On some systems, this <i>device independent troff</i> got
       a binary of its own, called <a href="ditroff.7.html">ditroff(7)</a>.  All modern <b>troff </b>programs
       already provide the full <b>ditroff </b>capabilities automatically.

   <b>Availability</b>
       The source code of both the ancient Unix and classical <i>troff</i> weren't
       available for two decades.  Meanwhile, it is accessible again (on-
       line) for non-commercial use, cf. section <b>SEE ALSO</b>.

   <b>groff — free GNU roff</b>
       The most important free <i>roff</i> project was the GNU implementation of
       <i>troff</i>, written from scratch by <i>James Clark</i> and put under the GNU
       Public License ⟨<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft</a>⟩.  It was called <i>groff</i>
       (GNU <i>roff</i>).  See <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> for an overview.

       The <i>groff</i> system is still actively developed.  It is compatible to
       the classical <i>troff</i>, but many extensions were added.  It is the first
       <i>roff</i> system that is available on almost all operating systems — and
       it is free.  This makes <i>groff</i> the de-facto <i>roff</i> standard today.

   <b>Free Heirloom roff</b>
       An alternative is <i>Gunnar Ritter's Heirloom roff project</i> 
       ⟨<a href="https://github.com/n-t-roff/heirloom-doctools">https://github.com/n-t-roff/heirloom-doctools</a>⟩ project, started in
       2005, which provides enhanced versions of the various roff tools
       found in the OpenSolaris and Plan 9 operating systems, now available
       under free licenses.  You can get this package with the shell com‐
       mand:
              $ git clone <a href="https://github.com/n-t-roff/heirloom-doctools">https://github.com/n-t-roff/heirloom-doctools</a>

       Moreover, one finds there the <i>Original Documenter's Workbench Release</i>
       <i>3.3</i> ⟨<a href="https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3">https://github.com/n-t-roff/DWB3.3</a>⟩.

<h2><a id="USING_ROFF" href="#USING_ROFF"></a>USING ROFF  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Most people won't even notice that they are actually using <i>roff</i>.
       When you read a system manual page (man page) <i>roff</i> is working in the
       background.  <i>roff</i> documents can be viewed with a native viewer called
       <b>xditview</b>(1x), a standard program of the X window distribution, see
       <b>X</b>(7x).  But using <i>roff</i> explicitly isn't difficult either.

       Some <i>roff</i> implementations provide wrapper programs that make it easy
       to use the <i>roff</i> system on the shell command line.  For example, the
       GNU <i>roff</i> implementation <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> provides command line options to
       avoid the long command pipes of classical <i>troff</i>; a program <a href="../man1/grog.1.html">grog(1)</a>
       tries to guess from the document which arguments should be used for a
       run of <b>groff</b>; people who do not like specifying command line options
       should try the <a href="../man1/groffer.1.html">groffer(1)</a> program for graphically displaying <i>groff</i>
       files and man pages.

   <b>The roff Pipe</b>
       Each <i>roff</i> system consists of preprocessors, <i>roff</i> formatter programs,
       and a set of device postprocessors.  This concept makes heavy use of
       the <i>piping</i> mechanism, that is, a series of programs is called one
       after the other, where the output of each program in the queue is
       taken as the input for the next program.

              cat <i>file</i> | ... | <i>preproc</i> | ... | troff <i>options</i> | <i>postproc</i>

       The preprocessors generate <i>roff</i> code that is fed into a <i>roff</i>
       formatter (e.g. <b>troff</b>), which in turn generates <i>intermediate output</i>
       that is fed into a device postprocessor program for printing or final
       output.

       All of these parts use programming languages of their own; each
       language is totally unrelated to the other parts.  Moreover, <i>roff</i>
       macro packages that were tailored for special purposes can be
       included.

       Most <i>roff</i> documents use the macros of some package, intermixed with
       code for one or more preprocessors, spiced with some elements from
       the plain <i>roff</i> language.  The full power of the <i>roff</i> formatting
       language is seldom needed by users; only programmers of macro
       packages need to know about the gory details.

   <b>Preprocessors</b>
       A <i>roff</i> preprocessor is any program that generates output that
       syntactically obeys the rules of the <i>roff</i> formatting language.  Each
       preprocessor defines a language of its own that is translated into
       <i>roff</i> code when run through the preprocessor program.  Parts written
       in these languages may be included within a <i>roff</i> document; they are
       identified by special <i>roff</i> requests or macros.  Each document that is
       enhanced by preprocessor code must be run through all corresponding
       preprocessors before it is fed into the actual <i>roff</i> formatter
       program, for the formatter just ignores all alien code.  The
       preprocessor programs extract and transform only the document parts
       that are determined for them.

       There are a lot of free and commercial <i>roff</i> preprocessors.  Some of
       them aren't available on each system, but there is a small set of
       preprocessors that are considered as an integral part of each <i>roff</i>
       system.  The classical preprocessors are

              <b>tbl      </b>for tables.
              <b>eqn      </b>for mathematical formulae.
              <b>pic      </b>for drawing diagrams.
              <b>refer    </b>for bibliographic references.
              <b>soelim   </b>for including macro files from standard locations.
              <b>chem     </b>for drawing chemical formulæ.

       Other known preprocessors that are not available on all systems
       include

              <b>grap   </b>for constructing graphical elements.
              <b>grn    </b>for including <b>gremlin</b>(1) pictures.

   <b>Formatter Programs</b>
       A <i>roff formatter</i> is a program that parses documents written in the
       <i>roff</i> formatting language or uses some of the <i>roff</i> macro packages.  It
       generates <i>intermediate output</i>, which is intended to be fed into a
       single device postprocessor that must be specified by a command-line
       option to the formatter program.  The documents must have been run
       through all necessary preprocessors before.

       The output produced by a <i>roff</i> formatter is represented in yet another
       language, the <i>intermediate output format</i> or <i>troff output</i>.  This
       language was first specified in <i>[CSTR #97]</i>; its GNU extension is
       documented in <a href="../man5/groff_out.5.html">groff_out(5)</a>.  The intermediate output language is a
       kind of assembly language compared to the high-level <i>roff</i> language.
       The generated intermediate output is optimized for a special device,
       but the language is the same for every device.

       The <i>roff</i> formatter is the heart of the <i>roff</i> system.  The traditional
       <i>roff</i> had two formatters, <b>nroff </b>for text devices and <b>troff </b>for
       graphical devices.

       Often, the name <i>troff</i> is used as a general term to refer to both
       formatters.

   <b>Devices and Postprocessors</b>
       Devices are hardware interfaces like printers, text or graphical
       terminals, etc., or software interfaces such as a conversion into a
       different text or graphical format.

       A <i>roff</i> postprocessor is a program that transforms <i>troff</i> output into a
       form suitable for a special device.  The <i>roff</i> postprocessors are like
       device drivers for the output target.

       For each device there is a postprocessor program that fits the device
       optimally.  The postprocessor parses the generated intermediate
       output and generates device-specific code that is sent directly to
       the device.

       The names of the devices and the postprocessor programs are not fixed
       because they greatly depend on the software and hardware abilities of
       the actual computer.  For example, the classical devices mentioned in
       <i>[CSTR #54]</i> have greatly changed since the classical times.  The old
       hardware doesn't exist any longer and the old graphical conversions
       were quite imprecise when compared to their modern counterparts.

       For example, the Postscript device <i>post</i> in classical <i>troff</i> had a
       resolution of 720 units per inch, while <i>groff</i>'s <i>ps</i> device has 72000,
       a refinement of factor 100.

       Today the operating systems provide device drivers for most printer-
       like hardware, so it isn't necessary to write a special hardware
       postprocessor for each printer.

<h2><a id="ROFF_PROGRAMMING" href="#ROFF_PROGRAMMING"></a>ROFF PROGRAMMING  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Documents using <i>roff</i> are normal text files decorated by <i>roff</i>
       formatting elements.  The <i>roff</i> formatting language is quite powerful;
       it is almost a full programming language and provides elements to
       enlarge the language.  With these, it became possible to develop
       macro packages that are tailored for special applications.  Such
       macro packages are much handier than plain <i>roff</i>.  So most people will
       choose a macro package without worrying about the internals of the
       <i>roff</i> language.

   <b>Macro Packages</b>
       Macro packages are collections of macros that are suitable to format
       a special kind of documents in a convenient way.  This greatly eases
       the usage of <i>roff</i>.  The macro definitions of a package are kept in a
       file called <i>name</i><b>.tmac </b>(classically <b>tmac.</b><i>name</i>).  All tmac files are
       stored in one or more directories at standardized positions.  Details
       on the naming of macro packages and their placement is found in
       <a href="../man5/groff_tmac.5.html">groff_tmac(5)</a>.

       A macro package that is to be used in a document can be announced to
       the formatter by the command line option <b>-m</b>, see <a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff(1)</a>, or it can
       be specified within a document using the file inclusion requests of
       the <i>roff</i> language, see <a href="groff.7.html">groff(7)</a>.

       Famous classical macro packages are <i>man</i> for traditional man pages,
       <i>mdoc</i> for BSD-style manual pages; the macro sets for books, articles,
       and letters are <i>me</i> (probably from the first name of its creator <i>Eric</i>
       Allman), <i>ms</i> (from <i>Manuscript Macros</i>), and <i>mm</i> (from <i>Memorandum</i>
       <i>Macros</i>).

   <b>The roff Formatting Language</b>
       The classical <i>roff</i> formatting language is documented in the <i>Troff</i>
       <i>User's Manual [CSTR #54]</i>.  The <i>roff</i> language is a full programming
       language providing requests, definition of macros, escape sequences,
       string variables, number or size registers, and flow controls.

       <i>Requests</i> are the predefined basic formatting commands similar to the
       commands at the shell prompt.  The user can define request-like
       elements using predefined <i>roff</i> elements.  These are then called
       <i>macros</i>.  A document writer will not note any difference in usage for
       requests or macros; both are written on a line on their own starting
       with a dot.

       <i>Escape sequences</i> are <i>roff</i> elements starting with a backslash ‘<b>\</b>’.
       They can be inserted anywhere, also in the midst of text in a line.
       They are used to implement various features, including the insertion
       of non-ASCII characters with <b>\(</b>, font changes with <b>\f</b>, in-line
       comments with <b>\"</b>, the escaping of special control characters like <b>\\</b>,
       and many other features.

       <i>Strings</i> are variables that can store a string.  A string is stored by
       the <b>.ds </b>request.  The stored string can be retrieved later by the <b>\*</b>
       escape sequence.

       <i>Registers</i> store numbers and sizes.  A register can be set with the
       request <b>.nr </b>and its value can be retrieved by the escape sequence <b>\n</b>.

       extension, e.g., the filename for this document is <i>roff.7</i>, i.e., it
       is kept in section 7 of the man pages.

       The classical macro packages take the package name as an extension,
       e.g. <i>file.</i><b>me </b>for a document using the <i>me</i> macro package, <i>file.</i><b>mm </b>for
       <i>mm</i>, <i>file.</i><b>ms </b>for <i>ms</i>, <i>file.</i><b>pic </b>for <i>pic</i> files, etc.

       But there is no general naming scheme for <i>roff</i> documents, though
       <i>file.</i><b>tr </b>for <i>troff file</i> is seen now and then.  Maybe there should be a
       standardization for the filename extensions of <i>roff</i> files.

       File name extensions can be very handy in conjunction with the
       <a href="../man1/less.1.html">less(1)</a> pager.  It provides the possibility to feed all input into a
       command-line pipe that is specified in the shell environment variable
       <b>LESSOPEN</b>.  This process is not well documented, so here an example:

              LESSOPEN='|lesspipe %s'

       where <b>lesspipe </b>is either a system supplied command or a shell script
       of your own.

       <a href="groff_filenames.7.html">groff_filenames(7)</a>.

<h2><a id="EDITING_ROFF" href="#EDITING_ROFF"></a>EDITING ROFF  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The best program for editing a <i>roff</i> document is Emacs (or Xemacs),
       see <b>emacs</b>(1).  It provides an <i>nroff</i> mode that is suitable for all
       kinds of <i>roff</i> dialects.  This mode can be activated by the following
       methods.

       When editing a file within Emacs the mode can be changed by typing
       ‘<i>M-x nroff-mode</i>’, where <b>M-x </b>means to hold down the <b>Meta </b>key (or <b>Alt</b>)
       and hitting the <b>x </b>key at the same time.

       But it is also possible to have the mode automatically selected when
       the file is loaded into the editor.

       ·      The most general method is to include the following 3 comment
              lines at the end of the file.

                     .\" Local Variables:
                     .\" mode: nroff
                     .\" End:

       ·      There is a set of file name extensions, e.g. the man pages
              that trigger the automatic activation of the <i>nroff</i> mode.

       ·      Theoretically, it is possible to write the sequence

                     .\" -*- nroff -*-

              as the first line of a file to have it started in <i>nroff</i> mode
              when loaded.  Unfortunately, some applications such as the <b>man</b>
              program are confused by this; so this is deprecated.

       All <i>roff</i> formatters provide automated line breaks and horizontal and
       vertical spacing.  In order to not disturb this, the following tips
       can be helpful.

       ·      Never include empty or blank lines in a <i>roff</i> document.
              Instead, use the empty request (a line consisting of a dot
              only) or a line comment <b>.\" </b>if a structuring element is
              needed.

       ·      Never start a line with whitespace because this can lead to
              unexpected behavior.  Indented paragraphs can be constructed
              in a controlled way by <i>roff</i> requests.

       ·      Start each sentence on a line of its own, for the spacing
              after a dot is handled differently depending on whether it
              terminates an abbreviation or a sentence.  To distinguish both
              cases, do a line break after each sentence.

       ·      To additionally use the auto-fill mode in Emacs, it is best to
              insert an empty <i>roff</i> request (a line consisting of a dot only)
              after each sentence.

       The following example shows how optimal <i>roff</i> editing could look.

              This is an example for a .I roff document.  .
              This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.  .
              This is a longer sentence stretching over several lines; abbreviations
              like ‘cf.’ are easily identified because the dot is not
              followed by a line break.  .  In the output, this will still go to
              the same paragraph.

       Besides Emacs, some other editors provide <i>nroff</i> style files too, e.g.
       <b>vim</b>(1), an extension of the <b>vi</b>(1) program.

   <b>Manual Pages</b>
       Due to its complex structure, a full <i>roff</i> system has many man pages,
       each describing a single aspect of <i>roff</i>.  Unfortunately, there is no
       general naming scheme for the documentation among the different <i>roff</i>
       implementations.

       In <i>groff</i>, the man page <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> contains a survey of all documenta‐
       tion available in <i>groff</i>.

       On other systems, you are on your own, but <a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff(1)</a> might be a good
       starting point.
