       fanotify - monitoring filesystem events
</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The fanotify API provides notification and interception of filesystem
       events.  Use cases include virus scanning and hierarchical storage
       management.  Currently, only a limited set of events is supported.
       In particular, there is no support for create, delete, and move
       events.  (See <a href="inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> for details of an API that does notify those
       events.)

       Additional capabilities compared to the <a href="inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> API include the
       ability to monitor all of the objects in a mounted filesystem, the
       ability to make access permission decisions, and the possibility to
       read or modify files before access by other applications.

       The following system calls are used with this API: <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>,
       <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>.

   <b>fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups</b>
       The <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> system call creates and initializes an fanotify
       notification group and returns a file descriptor referring to it.

       An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that holds
       a list of files, directories, and mount points for which events shall
       be created.

       For each entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks
       exist: the <i>mark</i> mask and the <i>ignore</i> mask.  The mark mask defines file
       activities for which an event shall be created.  The ignore mask
       defines activities for which no event shall be generated.  Having
       these two types of masks permits a mount point or directory to be
       marked for receiving events, while at the same time ignoring events
       for specific objects under that mount point or directory.

       The <a href="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> system call adds a file, directory, or mount to
       a notification group and specifies which events shall be reported (or
       ignored), or removes or modifies such an entry.

       A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache.  Events of
       interest for a file cache are modification of a file and closing of
       the same.  Hence, the cached directory or mount point is to be marked
       to receive these events.  After receiving the first event informing
       that a file has been modified, the corresponding cache entry will be
       invalidated.  No further modification events for this file are of
       interest until the file is closed.  Hence, the modify event can be
       added to the ignore mask.  Upon receiving the close event, the modify
       event can be removed from the ignore mask and the file cache entry
       can be updated.

       The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files and
       directories via their inode number and to mounts via their mount ID.
       If files or directories are renamed or moved within the same mount,
       the respective entries survive.  If files or directories are deleted
       or moved to another mount or if mounts are unmounted, the
       corresponding entries are deleted.

   <b>The event queue</b>
       As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a notification
       group, the fanotify system generates events that are collected in a
       queue.  These events can then be read (using <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or similar) from
       the fanotify file descriptor returned by <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       Two types of events are generated: <i>notification</i> events and <i>permission</i>
       events.  Notification events are merely informative and require no
       action to be taken by the receiving application except for closing
       the file descriptor passed in the event (see below).  Permission
       events are requests to the receiving application to decide whether
       permission for a file access shall be granted.  For these events, the
       recipient must write a response which decides whether access is
       granted or not.

       An event is removed from the event queue of the fanotify group when
       it has been read.  Permission events that have been read are kept in
       an internal list of the fanotify group until either a permission
       decision has been taken by writing to the fanotify file descriptor or
       the fanotify file descriptor is closed.

   <b>Reading fanotify events</b>
       Calling <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> for the file descriptor returned by <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>
       blocks (if the flag <b>FAN_NONBLOCK </b>is not specified in the call to
       <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>) until either a file event occurs or the call is
       interrupted by a signal (see <a href="signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>).

       After a successful <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, the read buffer contains one or more of
       the following structures:

           struct fanotify_event_metadata {
               __u32 event_len;
               __u8 vers;
               __u8 reserved;
               __u16 metadata_len;
               __aligned_u64 mask;
               __s32 fd;
               __s32 pid;
           };

       For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large buffer size
       (for example, 4096 bytes), so that multiple events can be retrieved
       by a single <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>.

       The return value of <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> is the number of bytes placed in the
       buffer, or -1 in case of an error (but see BUGS).

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure are as follows:

       <i>event_len</i>
              This is the length of the data for the current event and the
              offset to the next event in the buffer.  In the current
              implementation, the value of <i>event_len</i> is always
              <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>.  However, the API is designed to allow
              variable-length structures to be returned in the future.

       <i>vers</i>   This field holds a version number for the structure.  It must
              be compared to <b>FANOTIFY_METADATA_VERSION </b>to verify that the
              structures returned at runtime match the structures defined at
              compile time.  In case of a mismatch, the application should
              abandon trying to use the fanotify file descriptor.

       <i>reserved</i>
              This field is not used.

       <i>metadata_len</i>
              This is the length of the structure.  The field was introduced
              to facilitate the implementation of optional headers per event
              type.  No such optional headers exist in the current
              implementation.

       <i>mask</i>   This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).

       <i>fd</i>     This is an open file descriptor for the object being accessed,
              or <b>FAN_NOFD </b>if a queue overflow occurred.  The file descriptor
              can be used to access the contents of the monitored file or
              directory.  The reading application is responsible for closing
              this file descriptor.

              When calling <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, the caller may specify (via the
              <i>event_f_flags</i> argument) various file status flags that are to
              be set on the open file description that corresponds to this
              file descriptor.  In addition, the (kernel-internal)
              <b>FMODE_NONOTIFY </b>file status flag is set on the open file
              description.  This flag suppresses fanotify event generation.
              Hence, when the receiver of the fanotify event accesses the
              notified file or directory using this file descriptor, no
              additional events will be created.

       <i>pid</i>    This is the ID of the process that caused the event.  A
              program listening to fanotify events can compare this PID to
              the PID returned by <a href="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>, to determine whether the event
              is caused by the listener itself, or is due to a file access
              by another process.

       The bit mask in <i>mask</i> indicates which events have occurred for a
       single filesystem object.  Multiple bits may be set in this mask, if
       more than one event occurred for the monitored filesystem object.  In
       particular, consecutive events for the same filesystem object and
       originating from the same process may be merged into a single event,
       with the exception that two permission events are never merged into
       one queue entry.

       The bits that may appear in <i>mask</i> are as follows:

       <b>FAN_ACCESS</b>
              A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).

       <b>FAN_OPEN</b>
              A file or a directory was opened.

       <b>FAN_MODIFY</b>
              A file was modified.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>
              A file that was opened for writing (<b>O_WRONLY </b>or <b>O_RDWR</b>) was
              closed.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>
              A file or directory that was opened read-only (<b>O_RDONLY</b>) was
              closed.

       <b>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</b>
              The event queue exceeded the limit of 16384 entries.  This
              limit can be overridden by specifying the <b>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE</b>
              flag when calling <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       <b>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</b>
              An application wants to read a file or directory, for example
              using <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/readdir.2.html">readdir(2)</a>.  The reader must write a response
              (as described below) that determines whether the permission to
              access the filesystem object shall be granted.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM</b>
              An application wants to open a file or directory.  The reader
              must write a response that determines whether the permission
              to open the filesystem object shall be granted.

       To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:

       <b>FAN_CLOSE</b>
              A file was closed.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_CLOSE_WRITE | FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE

       The following macros are provided to iterate over a buffer containing
       fanotify event metadata returned by a <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> from an fanotify file
       descriptor:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)</b>
              This macro checks the remaining length <i>len</i> of the buffer <i>meta</i>
              against the length of the metadata structure and the <i>event_len</i>
              field of the first metadata structure in the buffer.

       <b>FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)</b>
              This macro uses the length indicated in the <i>event_len</i> field of
              the metadata structure pointed to by <i>meta</i> to calculate the
              address of the next metadata structure that follows <i>meta</i>.  <i>len</i>
              is the number of bytes of metadata that currently remain in
              the buffer.  The macro returns a pointer to the next metadata
              structure that follows <i>meta</i>, and reduces <i>len</i> by the number of
              bytes in the metadata structure that has been skipped over
              (i.e., it subtracts <i>meta-&gt;event_len</i> from <i>len</i>).

       In addition, there is:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>
              This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.  This is the minimum size (and
              currently the only size) of any event metadata.

   <b>Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events</b>
       When an fanotify event occurs, the fanotify file descriptor indicates
       as readable when passed to <a href="epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>.

   <b>Dealing with permission events</b>
       For permission events, the application must <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> a structure of
       the following form to the fanotify file descriptor:

           struct fanotify_response {
               __s32 fd;
               __u32 response;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>fd</i>     This is the file descriptor from the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.

       <i>response</i>
              This field indicates whether or not the permission is to be
              granted.  Its value must be either <b>FAN_ALLOW </b>to allow the file
              operation or <b>FAN_DENY </b>to deny the file operation.

       If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive an
       <b>EPERM </b>error.

   <b>Closing the fanotify file descriptor</b>
       When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification
       group are closed, the fanotify group is released and its resources
       are freed for reuse by the kernel.  Upon <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>, outstanding
       permission events will be set to allowed.

   <b>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo</b>
       The file <i>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd]</i> contains information about fanotify
       marks for file descriptor <i>fd</i> of process <i>pid</i>.  See <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for
       details.
</pre>
<h2><a id="ERRORS" href="#ERRORS"></a>ERRORS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       In addition to the usual errors for <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, the following errors can
       occur when reading from the fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The buffer is too small to hold the event.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The per-process limit on the number of open files has been
              reached.  See the description of <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE </b>in
              <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has
              been reached.  See <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i> in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              This error is returned by <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> if <b>O_RDWR </b>or <b>O_WRONLY </b>was
              specified in the <i>event_f_flags</i> argument when calling
              <a href="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> and an event occurred for a monitored file
              that is currently being executed.

       In addition to the usual errors for <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, the following errors
       can occur when writing to the fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>EINVAL </b>Fanotify access permissions are not enabled in the kernel
              configuration or the value of <i>response</i> in the response
              structure is not valid.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The file descriptor <i>fd</i> in the response structure is not valid.
              This may occur when a response for the permission event has
              already been written.

<h2><a id="VERSIONS" href="#VERSIONS"></a>VERSIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The fanotify API was introduced in version 2.6.36 of the Linux kernel
       and enabled in version 2.6.37.  Fdinfo support was added in version
       3.8.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONFORMING_TO" href="#CONFORMING_TO"></a>CONFORMING TO  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The fanotify API is Linux-specific.
</pre>
<h2><a id="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was built with the
       <b>CONFIG_FANOTIFY </b>configuration option enabled.  In addition, fanotify
       permission handling is available only if the
       <b>CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS </b>configuration option is enabled.

   <b>Limitations and caveats</b>
       Fanotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers
       through the filesystem API.  As a result, it does not catch remote
       events that occur on network filesystems.

       The fanotify API does not report file accesses and modifications that
       may occur because of <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/msync.2.html">msync(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a>.

       Events for directories are created only if the directory itself is
       opened, read, and closed.  Adding, removing, or changing children of
       a marked directory does not create events for the monitored directory
       itself.

       Fanotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor
       subdirectories under a directory, additional marks must be created.
       (But note that the fanotify API provides no way of detecting when a
       subdirectory has been created under a marked directory, which makes
       recursive monitoring difficult.)  Monitoring mounts offers the
       capability to monitor a whole directory tree.

       The event queue can overflow.  In this case, events are lost.
</pre>
<h2><a id="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Before Linux 3.19, <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> did not generate fanotify events.
       Since Linux 3.19, calls to <a href="../man2/fallocate.2.html">fallocate(2)</a> generate <b>FAN_MODIFY </b>events.

       As of Linux 3.17, the following bugs exist:

       *  On Linux, a filesystem object may be accessible through multiple
          paths, for example, a part of a filesystem may be remounted using
          the <i>--bind</i> option of <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>.  A listener that marked a mount
          will be notified only of events that were triggered for a
          filesystem object using the same mount.  Any other event will pass
          unnoticed.

       *  When an event is generated, no check is made to see whether the
          user ID of the receiving process has authorization to read or
          write the file before passing a file descriptor for that file.
          This poses a security risk, when the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability is
          set for programs executed by unprivileged users.

       *  If a call to <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> processes multiple events from the fanotify
          queue and an error occurs, the return value will be the total
          length of the events successfully copied to the user-space buffer
          before the error occurred.  The return value will not be -1, and
          <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> will not be set.  Thus, the reading application has no way
          to detect the error.

       The following program demonstrates the usage of the fanotify API.  It
       marks the mount point passed as a command-line argument and waits for
       events of type <b>FAN_PERM_OPEN </b>and <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>.  When a permission
       event occurs, a <b>FAN_ALLOW </b>response is given.

       The following output was recorded while editing the file
       <i>/home/user/temp/notes</i>.  Before the file was opened, a <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM</b>
       event occurred.  After the file was closed, a <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE </b>event
       occurred.  Execution of the program ends when the user presses the
       ENTER key.

   <b>Example output</b>
           # ./fanotify_example /home
           Press enter key to terminate.
           Listening for events.
           FAN_OPEN_PERM: File /home/user/temp/notes
           FAN_CLOSE_WRITE: File /home/user/temp/notes

           Listening for events stopped.
