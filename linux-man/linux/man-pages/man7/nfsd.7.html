       The <b>nfsd </b>filesystem is a special filesystem which provides access to
       the Linux NFS server.  The filesystem consists of a single directory
       which contains a number of files.  These files are actually gateways
       into the NFS server.  Writing to them can affect the server.  Reading
       from them can provide information about the server.

       This file system is only available in Linux 2.6 and later series
       kernels (and in the later parts of the 2.5 development series leading
       up to 2.6).  This man page does not apply to 2.4 and earlier.

       As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of files in the
       <b>procfs </b>filesystem (normally mounted at <b>/proc</b>) which are used to
       control the NFS server.  This manual page describes all of these
       files.

       The <i>exportfs</i> and <i>mountd</i> programs (part of the nfs-utils package)
       expect to find this filesystem mounted at <b>/proc/fs/nfsd </b>or
       <b>/proc/fs/nfs</b>.  If it is not mounted, they will fall-back on 2.4 style
       functionality.  This involves accessing the NFS server via a
       systemcall.  This systemcall is scheduled to be removed after the 2.6
       kernel series.
</pre>
<h2><a id="DETAILS" href="#DETAILS"></a>DETAILS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The three files in the <b>nfsd </b>filesystem are:

       <b>exports</b>
              This file contains a list of filesystems that are currently
              exported and clients that each filesystem is exported to,
              together with a list of export options for that
              client/filesystem pair.  This is similar to the
              <b>/proc/fs/nfs/exports </b>file in 2.4.  One difference is that a
              client doesn't necessarily correspond to just one host.  It
              can respond to a large collection of hosts that are being
              treated identically.

              Each line of the file contains a path name, a client name, and
              a number of options in parentheses.  Any space, tab, newline
              or back-slash character in the path name or client name will
              be replaced by a backslash followed by the octal ASCII code
              for that character.

       <b>threads</b>
              This file represents the number of <b>nfsd </b>thread currently
              running.  Reading it will show the number of threads.  Writing
              an ASCII decimal number will cause the number of threads to be
              changed (increased or decreased as necessary) to achieve that
              number.

       <b>filehandle</b>
              This is a somewhat unusual file  in that what is read from it
              depends on what was just written to it.  It provides a
              transactional interface where a program can open the file,
              write a request, and read a response.  If two separate
              programs open, write, and read at the same time, their
              requests will not be mixed up.

              The request written to <b>filehandle </b>should be a client name, a
              path name, and a number of bytes.  This should be followed by
              a newline, with white-space separating the fields, and octal
              quoting of special characters.

              On writing this, the program will be able to read back a
              filehandle for that path as exported to the given client.  The
              filehandle's length will be at most the number of bytes given.

              The filehandle will be represented in hex with a leading '\x'.

       The directory <b>/proc/net/rpc </b>in the <b>procfs </b>filesystem contains a
       number of files and directories.  The files contain statistics that
       can be display using the <i>nfsstat</i> program.  The directories contain
       information about various caches that the NFS server maintains to
       keep track of access permissions that different clients have for
       different filesystems.  The caches are:

       <b>auth.unix.ip</b>
              This cache contains a mapping from IP address to the name of
              the authentication domain that the ipaddress should be treated
              as part of.

       <b>nfsd.export</b>
              This cache contains a mapping from directory and domain to
              export options.

       <b>nfsd.fh</b>
              This cache contains a mapping from domain and a filesystem
              identifier to a directory.   The filesystem identifier is
              stored in the filehandles and consists of a number indicating
              the type of identifier and a number of hex bytes indicating
              the content of the identifier.

       Each directory representing a cache can hold from 1 to 3 files.  They
       are:

       <b>flush  </b>When a number of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970) is written
              to this file, all entries in the cache that were last updated
              before that file become invalidated and will be flushed out.
              Writing a time in the future (in seconds since epoch) will
              flush everything.  This is the only file that will always be
              present.

       <b>content</b>
              This file, if present, contains a textual representation of
              ever entry in the cache, one per line.  If an entry is still
              in the cache (because it is actively being used) but has
              expired or is otherwise invalid, it will be presented as a
              comment (with a leading hash character).

       <b>channel</b>
              This file, if present, acts a channel for request from the
              kernel-based nfs server to be passed to a user-space program
              for handling.

              When the kernel needs some information which isn't in the
              cache, it makes a line appear in the <b>channel </b>file giving the
              key for the information.  A user-space program should read
              this, find the answer, and write a line containing the key, an
              expiry time, and the content.  For example the kernel might
              make
                   nfsd 127.0.0.1
              appear in the <b>auth.unix.ip/content </b>file.  The user-space
              program might then write
                   nfsd 127.0.0.1 1057206953 localhost
              to indicate that 127.0.0.1 should map to localhost, at least
              for now.

              If the program uses select(2) or poll(2) to discover if it can
              read from the <b>channel </b>then it will never see and end-of-file
              but when all requests have been answered, it will block until
              another request appears.

       In the <b>/proc </b>filesystem there are 4 files that can be used to enabled
       extra tracing of nfsd and related code.  They are:
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/nlm_debug</b>
            <b>/proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug</b>
       They control tracing for the NFS client, the NFS server, the Network
       Lock Manager (lockd) and the underlying RPC layer respectively.
       Decimal numbers can be read from or written to these files.  Each
       number represents a bit-pattern where bits that are set cause certain
       classes of tracing to be enabled.  Consult the kernel header files to
       find out what number correspond to what tracing.
