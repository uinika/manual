       The <i>kill</i>() function shall send a signal to a process or a group of
       processes specified by <i>pid</i>.  The signal to be sent is specified by
       <i>sig</i> and is either one from the list given in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> or 0. If <i>sig</i>
       is 0 (the null signal), error checking is performed but no signal is
       actually sent. The null signal can be used to check the validity of
       <i>pid</i>.

       For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process
       designated by <i>pid</i>, unless the sending process has appropriate
       privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending process
       shall match the real or saved set-user-ID of the receiving process.

       If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to the process whose
       process ID is equal to <i>pid</i>.

       If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an
       unspecified set of system processes) whose process group ID is equal
       to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has
       permission to send a signal.

       If <i>pid</i> is −1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an
       unspecified set of system processes) for which the process has
       permission to send that signal.

       If <i>pid</i> is negative, but not −1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes
       (excluding an unspecified set of system processes) whose process
       group ID is equal to the absolute value of <i>pid</i>, and for which the
       process has permission to send a signal.

       If the value of <i>pid</i> causes <i>sig</i> to be generated for the sending
       process, and if <i>sig</i> is not blocked for the calling thread and if no
       other thread has <i>sig</i> unblocked or is waiting in a <i>sigwait</i>() function
       for <i>sig</i>, either <i>sig</i> or at least one pending unblocked signal shall be
       delivered to the sending thread before <i>kill</i>() returns.

       The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when sending
       SIGCONT to a process that is a member of the same session as the
       sending process.

       An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose
       further implementation-defined restrictions on the sending of
       signals, including the null signal. In particular, the system may
       deny the existence of some or all of the processes specified by <i>pid</i>.

       The <i>kill</i>() function is successful if the process has permission to
       send <i>sig</i> to any of the processes specified by <i>pid</i>.  If <i>kill</i>() fails,
       no signal shall be sent.

       The semantics for permission checking for <i>kill</i>() differed between
       System V and most other implementations, such as Version 7 or 4.3
       BSD. The semantics chosen for this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 agree with
       System V.  Specifically, a set-user-ID process cannot protect itself
       against signals (or at least not against SIGKILL) unless it changes
       its real user ID.  This choice allows the user who starts an
       application to send it signals even if it changes its effective user
       ID.  The other semantics give more power to an application that wants
       to protect itself from the user who ran it.

       Some implementations provide semantic extensions to the <i>kill</i>()
       function when the absolute value of <i>pid</i> is greater than some maximum,
       or otherwise special, value. Negative values are a flag to <i>kill</i>().
       Since most implementations return <b>[ESRCH] </b>in this case, this behavior
       is not included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, although a conforming
       implementation could provide such an extension.

       The unspecified processes to which a signal cannot be sent may
       include the scheduler or <i>init</i>.

       There was initially strong sentiment to specify that, if <i>pid</i>
       specifies that a signal be sent to the calling process and that
       signal is not blocked, that signal would be delivered before <i>kill</i>()
       returns. This would permit a process to call <i>kill</i>() and be guaranteed
       that the call never return. However, historical implementations that
       provide only the <i>signal</i>() function make only the weaker guarantee in
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, because they only deliver one signal
       each time a process enters the kernel.  Modifications to such
       implementations to support the <i>sigaction</i>() function generally require
       entry to the kernel following return from a signal-catching function,
       in order to restore the signal mask. Such modifications have the
       effect of satisfying the stronger requirement, at least when
       <i>sigaction</i>() is used, but not necessarily when <i>signal</i>() is used. The
       standard developers considered making the stronger requirement except
       when <i>signal</i>() is used, but felt this would be unnecessarily complex.
       Implementors are encouraged to meet the stronger requirement whenever
       possible. In practice, the weaker requirement is the same, except in
       the rare case when two signals arrive during a very short window.
       This reasoning also applies to a similar requirement for
       <i>sigprocmask</i>().

       In 4.2 BSD, the SIGCONT signal can be sent to any descendant process
       regardless of user-ID security checks.  This allows a job control
       shell to continue a job even if processes in the job have altered
       their user IDs (as in the <i>su</i> command). In keeping with the addition
       of the concept of sessions, similar functionality is provided by
       allowing the SIGCONT signal to be sent to any process in the same
       session regardless of user ID security checks. This is less
       restrictive than BSD in the sense that ancestor processes (in the
       same session) can now be the recipient.  It is more restrictive than
       BSD in the sense that descendant processes that form new sessions are
       now subject to the user ID checks. A similar relaxation of security
       is not necessary for the other job control signals since those
       signals are typically sent by the terminal driver in recognition of
       special characters being typed; the terminal driver bypasses all
       security checks.

       In secure implementations, a process may be restricted from sending a
       signal to a process having a different security label.  In order to
       prevent the existence or nonexistence of a process from being used as
       a covert channel, such processes should appear nonexistent to the
       sender; that is, <b>[ESRCH] </b>should be returned, rather than <b>[EPERM]</b>, if
       <i>pid</i> refers only to such processes.

       Existing implementations vary on the result of a <i>kill</i>() with <i>pid</i>
       indicating an inactive process (a terminated process that has not
       been waited for by its parent). Some indicate success on such a call
       (subject to permission checking), while others give an error of
       <b>[ESRCH]</b>.  Since the definition of process lifetime in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 covers inactive processes, the <b>[ESRCH] </b>error as
       described is inappropriate in this case. In particular, this means
       that an application cannot have a parent process check for
       termination of a particular child with <i>kill</i>().  (Usually this is done
       with the null signal; this can be done reliably with <i>waitpid</i>().)

       There is some belief that the name <i>kill</i>() is misleading, since the
       function is not always intended to cause process termination.
       However, the name is common to all historical implementations, and
       any change would be in conflict with the goal of minimal changes to
       existing application code.
