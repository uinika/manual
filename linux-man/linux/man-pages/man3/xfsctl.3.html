       Some functionality specific to the XFS filesystem is accessible to
       applications through platform-specific system call interfaces.  These
       operations can be divided into two sections - operations that operate
       on individual files, and operations that operate on the filesystem
       itself. Care should be taken when issuing <b>xfsctl</b>() calls to ensure
       the target path and file descriptor (both must be supplied) do indeed
       represent a file from an XFS filesystem.  The <a href="../man2/statfs.2.html">statfs(2)</a> and
       <a href="../man2/fstatfs.2.html">fstatfs(2)</a> system calls can be used to determine whether or not an
       arbitrary path or file descriptor belong to an XFS filesystem.  These
       are not portable however, so the routines <b>platform_test_xfs_fd</b>() and
       <b>platform_test_xfs_path</b>() provide a platform-independent mechanism.

   <b>File Operations</b>
       In order to effect an operation on an individual file, the pathname
       and descriptor arguments passed to <b>xfsctl </b>identifies the file being
       operated on.  The final argument described below refers to the final
       argument of <b>xfsctl</b>.  All of the data structures and macros mentioned
       below are defined in the &lt;<i>xfs/xfs_fs.h</i>&gt; header file.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64</b>
              Alter storage space associated with a section of the ordinary
              file specified.  The section is specified by a variable of
              type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b>, pointed to by the final argument.  The
              data type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>contains the following members:
              <b>l_whence </b>is 0, 1, or 2 to indicate that the relative offset
              <b>l_start </b>will be measured from the start of the file, the
              current position, or the end of the file, respectively (i.e.,
              <b>l_start </b>is the offset from the position specified in
              <b>l_whence</b>).  If the offset specified is before the current end
              of file, any data previously written into this section is no
              longer accessible.  If the offset specified is beyond the
              current end of file, the file is grown and filled with zeroes.
              The <b>l_len </b>field is currently ignored, and should be set to
              zero.

              <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>, <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>, <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP </b>and
              <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64 </b>operations are all identical.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM</b>
              Set the di_dmevmask and di_dmstate fields in an XFS on-disk
              inode.  The only legitimate values for these fields are those
              previously returned in the <b>bs_dmevmask </b>and <b>bs_dmstate </b>fields
              of the bulkstat structure.  The data referred to by the final
              argument is a <b>struct fsdmidata</b>.  This structure's members are
              <b>fsd_dmevmask </b>and <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.  The di_dmevmask field is set to
              the value in <b>fsd_dmevmask</b>.  The di_dmstate field is set to the
              value in <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.  This command is restricted to root or
              to processes with device management capabilities.  Its sole
              purpose is to allow backup and restore programs to restore the
              aforementioned critical on-disk inode fields.

       <b>XFS_IOC_DIOINFO</b>
              Get information required to perform direct I/O on the
              specified file descriptor.  Direct I/O is performed directly
              to and from a user's data buffer.  Since the kernel's buffer
              cache is no longer between the two, the user's data buffer
              must conform to the same type of constraints as required for
              accessing a raw disk partition.  The final argument points to
              a variable of type <b>struct dioattr</b>, which contains the
              following members: <b>d_mem </b>is the memory alignment requirement
              of the user's data buffer.  <b>d_miniosz </b>specifies block size,
              minimum I/O request size, and I/O alignment.  The size of all
              I/O requests must be a multiple of this amount and the value
              of the seek pointer at the time of the I/O request must also
              be an integer multiple of this amount.  <b>d_maxiosz </b>is the
              maximum I/O request size which can be performed on the file
              descriptor.  If an I/O request does not meet these
              constraints, the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> will fail with EINVAL.
              All I/O requests are kept consistent with any data brought
              into the cache with an access through a non-direct I/O file
              descriptor.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR</b>
              Get additional attributes associated with files in XFS file
              systems.  The final argument points to a variable of type
              <b>struct fsxattr</b>, whose fields include: <b>fsx_xflags </b>(extended
              flag bits), <b>fsx_extsize </b>(nominal extent size in file system
              blocks), <b>fsx_nextents </b>(number of data extents in the file).  A
              <b>fsx_extsize </b>value returned indicates that a preferred extent
              size was previously set on the file, a <b>fsx_extsize </b>of zero
              indicates that the defaults for that filesystem will be used.
              A <b>fsx_cowextsize </b>value returned indicates that a preferred
              copy on write extent size was previously set on the file,
              whereas a <b>fsx_cowextsize </b>of zero indicates that the defaults
              for that filesystem will be used.  The current default for
              <b>fsx_cowextsize </b>is 128 blocks.  Currently the meaningful bits
              for the <b>fsx_xflags </b>field are:
              Bit 0 (0x1) - XFS_XFLAG_REALTIME
                        The file is a realtime file.
              Bit 1 (0x2) - XFS_XFLAG_PREALLOC
                        The file has preallocated space.
              Bit 3 (0x8) - XFS_XFLAG_IMMUTABLE
                        The file is immutable - it cannot be modified,
                        deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this
                        file and no data can be written to the file.  Only
                        the superuser or a process possessing the
                        CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this
                        flag.
              Bit 4 (0x10) - XFS_XFLAG_APPEND
                        The file is append-only - it can only be open in
                        append mode for writing.  Only the superuser or a
                        process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
                        capability can set or clear this flag.
              Bit 5 (0x20) - XFS_XFLAG_SYNC
                        All writes to the file are synchronous.
              Bit 6 (0x40) - XFS_XFLAG_NOATIME
                        When the file is accessed, its atime record is not
                        modified.
              Bit 7 (0x80) - XFS_XFLAG_NODUMP
                        The file should be skipped by backup utilities.
              Bit 8 (0x100) - XFS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT
                        Realtime inheritance bit - new files created in the
                        directory will be automatically realtime, and new
                        directories created in the directory will inherit
                        the inheritance bit.
              Bit 9 (0x200) - XFS_XFLAG_PROJINHERIT
                        Project inheritance bit - new files and directories
                        created in the directory will inherit the parents
                        project ID.  New directories also inherit the
                        project inheritance bit.
              Bit 10 (0x400) - XFS_XFLAG_NOSYMLINKS
                        Can only be set on a directory and disallows
                        creation of symbolic links in that directory.
              Bit 11 (0x800) - XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE
                        Extent size bit - if a basic extent size value is
                        set on the file then the allocator will allocate in
                        multiples of the set size for this file (see
                        <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>below).
              Bit 12 (0x1000) - XFS_XFLAG_EXTSZINHERIT
                        Extent size inheritance bit - new files and
                        directories created in the directory will inherit
                        the parents basic extent size value (see
                        <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>below).  Can only be set on a
                        directory.
              Bit 13 (0x2000) - XFS_XFLAG_NODEFRAG
                        No defragment file bit - the file should be skipped
                        during a defragmentation operation. When applied to
                        a directory, new files and directories created will
                        inherit the no-defrag bit.
              Bit 14 (0x4000) - XFS_XFLAG_FILESTREAM
                        Filestream allocator bit - allows a directory to
                        reserve an allocation group for exclusive use by
                        files created within that directory. Files being
                        written in other directories will not use the same
                        allocation group and so files within different
                        directories will not interleave extents on disk. The
                        reservation is only active while files are being
                        created and written into the directory.
              Bit 15 (0x8000) - XFS_XFLAG_DAX
                        If the filesystem lives on directly accessible
                        persistent memory, reads and writes to this file
                        will go straight to the persistent memory, bypassing
                        the page cache.  A file cannot be reflinked and have
                        the <b>XFS_XFLAG_DAX </b>set at the same time.  That is to
                        say that DAX files cannot share blocks.
              Bit 16 (0x10000) - XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE
                        Copy on Write Extent size bit - if a CoW extent size
                        value is set on the file, the allocator will
                        allocate extents for staging a copy on write
                        operation in multiples of the set size for this file
                        (see <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR </b>below).  If the CoW extent
                        size is set on a directory, then new file and
                        directories created in the directory will inherit
                        the parent's CoW extent size value.
              Bit 31 (0x80000000) - XFS_XFLAG_HASATTR
                        The file has extended attributes associated with it.
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA</b>
              Identical to <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR </b>except that the <b>fsx_nextents</b>
              field contains the number of attribute extents in the file.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR</b>
              Set additional attributes associated with files in XFS file
              systems.  The final argument points to a variable of type
              <b>struct fsxattr</b>, but only the following fields are used in this
              call: <b>fsx_xflags</b>, <b>fsx_extsize</b>, <b>fsx_cowextsize</b>, and <b>fsx_projid</b>.
              The <b>fsx_xflags </b>realtime file bit and the file's extent size
              may be changed only when the file is empty, except in the case
              of a directory where the extent size can be set at any time
              (this value is only used for regular file allocations, so
              should only be set on a directory in conjunction with the
              XFS_XFLAG_EXTSZINHERIT flag).  The copy on write extent size,
              <b>fsx_cowextsize</b>, can be set at any time.

       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAP</b>
              Get the block map for a segment of a file in an XFS file
              system.  The final argument points to an arry of variables of
              type <b>struct getbmap</b>.  All sizes and offsets in the structure
              are in units of 512 bytes.  The structure fields include:
              <b>bmv_offset </b>(file offset of segment), <b>bmv_block </b>(starting block
              of segment), <b>bmv_length </b>(length of segment), <b>bmv_count </b>(number
              of array entries, including the first), and <b>bmv_entries</b>
              (number of entries filled in).  The first structure in the
              array is a header, and the remaining structures in the array
              contain block map information on return.  The header controls
              iterative calls to the <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAP </b>command.  The caller
              fills in the <b>bmv_offset </b>and <b>bmv_length </b>fields of the header to
              indicate the area of interest in the file, and fills in the
              <b>bmv_count </b>field to indicate the length of the array.  If the
              <b>bmv_length </b>value is set to -1 then the length of the
              interesting area is the rest of the file.  On return from a
              call, the header is updated so that the command can be reused
              to obtain more information, without re-initializing the
              structures.  Also on return, the <b>bmv_entries </b>field of the
              header is set to the number of array entries actually filled
              in.  The non-header structures will be filled in with
              <b>bmv_offset</b>, <b>bmv_block</b>, and <b>bmv_length</b>.  If a region of the
              file has no blocks (is a hole in the file) then the <b>bmv_block</b>
              field is set to -1.

       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAPA</b>
              Identical to <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAP </b>except that information about the
              attribute fork of the file is returned.

       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP</b>

       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP64</b>
              This command is used to allocate space to a file.  A range of
              bytes is specified using a pointer to a variable of type
              <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the final argument.  The blocks are
              allocated, but not zeroed, and the file size does not change.
              If the XFS filesystem is configured to flag unwritten file
              extents, performance will be negatively affected when writing
              to preallocated space, since extra filesystem transactions are
              required to convert extent flags on the range of the file
              written.  If <a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info(8)</a> reports unwritten=1, then the
              filesystem was made to flag unwritten extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP</b>

       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP64</b>
              This command is used to free space from a file.  A range of
              bytes is specified using a pointer to a variable of type
              <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the final argument.  Partial filesystem
              blocks are zeroed, and whole filesystem blocks are removed
              from the file.  The file size does not change.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE</b>
              This command is used to convert a range of a file to zeros
              without issuing data IO.  A range of bytes is specified using
              a pointer to a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the final
              argument.  Blocks are preallocated for regions that span holes
              in the file, and the entire range is converted to unwritten
              extents.  This operation is a fast method of overwriting any
              from the range specified with zeros without removing any
              blocks or having to write zeros to disk.  Any subsequent read
              in the given range will return zeros until new data is
              written.  This functionality requires filesystems to support
              unwritten extents.  If <a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info(8)</a> reports unwritten=1, then
              the filesystem was made to flag unwritten extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_FSHANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FD_TO_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_OPEN_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_READLINK_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ATTR_LIST_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ATTR_MULTI_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE</b>
              These are all interfaces that are used to implement various
              <i>libhandle</i> functions (see <a href="open_by_handle.3.html">open_by_handle(3)</a>).  They are all
              subject to change and should not be called directly by
              applications.

   <b>Filesystem Operations</b>
       In order to effect one of the following operations, the pathname and
       descriptor arguments passed to <b>xfsctl</b>() can be any open file in the
       XFS filesystem in question.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSINUMBERS</b>
              This interface is used to extract a list of valid inode
              numbers from an XFS filesystem.  It is intended to be called
              iteratively, to obtain the entire set of inodes.  The
              information is passed in and out via a structure of type
              <b>xfs_fsop_bulkreq_t </b>pointed to by the final argument.  <b>lastip</b>
              is a pointer to a variable containing the last inode number
              returned, initially it should be zero.  <b>icount </b>is the size of
              the array of structures specified by <b>ubuffer</b>.  <b>ubuffer </b>is the
              address of an array of structures, of type <b>xfs_inogrp_t</b>.  This
              structure has the following elements: <b>xi_startino </b>(starting
              inode number), <b>xi_alloccount </b>(count of bits set in
              xi_allocmask), and <b>xi_allocmask </b>(mask of allocated inodes in
              this group).  The bitmask is 64 bits long, and the least
              significant bit corresponds to inode <b>xi_startino.  </b>Each bit is
              set if the corresponding inode is in use.  <b>ocount </b>is a pointer
              to a count of returned values, filled in by the call.  An
              output <b>ocount </b>value of zero means that the inode table has
              been exhausted.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT</b>
              This interface is used to extract inode information (stat
              information) "in bulk" from a filesystem.  It is intended to
              be called iteratively, to obtain information about the entire
              set of inodes in a filesystem.  The information is passed in
              and out via a structure of type <b>xfs_fsop_bulkreq_t </b>pointed to
              by the final argument.  <b>lastip </b>is a pointer to a variable
              containing the last inode number returned, initially it should
              be zero.  <b>icount </b>indicates the size of the array of structures
              specified by <b>ubuffer.  ubuffer </b>is the address of an array of
              structures of type <b>xfs_bstat_t</b>.  Many of the elements in the
              structure are the same as for the stat structure.  The
              structure has the following elements: <b>bs_ino </b>(inode number),
              <b>bs_mode </b>(type and mode), <b>bs_nlink </b>(number of links), <b>bs_uid</b>
              (user id), <b>bs_gid </b>(group id), <b>bs_rdev </b>(device value),
              <b>bs_blksize </b>(block size of the filesystem), <b>bs_size </b>(file size
              in bytes), <b>bs_atime </b>(access time), <b>bs_mtime </b>(modify time),
              <b>bs_ctime </b>(inode change time), <b>bs_blocks </b>(number of blocks used
              by the file), <b>bs_xflags </b>(extended flags), <b>bs_extsize </b>(extent
              size), <b>bs_extents </b>(number of extents), <b>bs_gen </b>(generation
              count), <b>bs_projid_lo </b>(project id - low word), <b>bs_projid_hi</b>
              (project id - high word, used when projid32bit feature is
              enabled), <b>bs_dmevmask </b>(DMIG event mask), <b>bs_dmstate </b>(DMIG
              state information), and <b>bs_aextents </b>(attribute extent count).
              <b>ocount </b>is a pointer to a count of returned values, filled in
              by the call.  An output <b>ocount </b>value of zero means that the
              inode table has been exhausted.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT_SINGLE</b>
              This interface is a variant of the <b>XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT</b>
              interface, used to obtain information about a single inode.
              for an open file in the filesystem of interest.  The same
              structure is used to pass information in and out of the
              kernel, except no output count parameter is used (should be
              initialized to zero).  An error is returned if the inode
              number is invalid.

       <b>XFS_IOC_THAW</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREEZE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGROWFSDATA</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGROWFSLOG</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGROWFSRT</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSCOUNTS</b>
              These interfaces are used to implement various filesystem
              internal operations on XFS filesystems.  For
              <b>XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY </b>(get filesystem mkfs time information), the
              output structure is of type <b>xfs_fsop_geom_t</b>.  For
              <b>XFS_FS_COUNTS </b>(get filesystem dynamic global information), the
              output structure is of type <b>xfs_fsop_counts_t</b>.  The remainder
              of these operations will not be described further as they are
              not of general use to applications.
