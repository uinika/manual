       The <i>fcntl</i>() function shall perform the operations described below on
       open files. The <i>fildes</i> argument is a file descriptor.

       The available values for <i>cmd</i> are defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> and are as
       follows:

       F_DUPFD       Return a new file descriptor which shall be the lowest
                     numbered available (that is, not already open) file
                     descriptor greater than or equal to the third argument,
                     <i>arg</i>, taken as an integer of type <b>int</b>.  The new file
                     descriptor shall refer to the same open file
                     description as the original file descriptor, and shall
                     share any locks. The FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with
                     the new file descriptor shall be cleared to keep the
                     file open across calls to one of the <i>exec</i> functions.

       F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC
                     Like F_DUPFD, but the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with
                     the new file descriptor shall be set.

       F_GETFD       Get the file descriptor flags defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> that
                     are associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes</i>.  File
                     descriptor flags are associated with a single file
                     descriptor and do not affect other file descriptors
                     that refer to the same file.

       F_SETFD       Set the file descriptor flags defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>,
                     that are associated with <i>fildes</i>, to the third argument,
                     <i>arg</i>, taken as type <b>int</b>.  If the FD_CLOEXEC flag in the
                     third argument is 0, the file descriptor shall remain
                     open across the <i>exec</i> functions; otherwise, the file
                     descriptor shall be closed upon successful execution of
                     one of the <i>exec</i> functions.

       F_GETFL       Get the file status flags and file access modes,
                     defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for the file description
                     associated with <i>fildes</i>.  The file access modes can be
                     extracted from the return value using the mask
                     O_ACCMODE, which is defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.  File status
                     flags and file access modes are associated with the
                     file description and do not affect other file
                     descriptors that refer to the same file with different
                     open file descriptions. The flags returned may include
                     non-standard file status flags which the application
                     did not set, provided that these additional flags do
                     not alter the behavior of a conforming application.

       F_SETFL       Set the file status flags, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for
                     the file description associated with <i>fildes</i> from the
                     corresponding bits in the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as
                     type <b>int</b>.  Bits corresponding to the file access mode
                     and the file creation flags, as defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>,
                     that are set in <i>arg</i> shall be ignored. If any bits in
                     <i>arg</i> other than those mentioned here are changed by the
                     application, the result is unspecified. If <i>fildes</i> does
                     not support non-blocking operations, it is unspecified
                     whether the O_NONBLOCK flag will be ignored.

       F_GETOWN      If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, get the process or
                     process group ID specified to receive SIGURG signals
                     when out-of-band data is available. Positive values
                     indicate a process ID; negative values, other than −1,
                     indicate a process group ID. If <i>fildes</i> does not refer
                     to a socket, the results are unspecified.

       F_SETOWN      If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, set the process or
                     process group ID specified to receive SIGURG signals
                     when out-of-band data is available, using the value of
                     the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as type <b>int</b>.  Positive
                     values indicate a process ID; negative values, other
                     than −1, indicate a process group ID. If <i>fildes</i> does
                     not refer to a socket, the results are unspecified.

       The following values for <i>cmd</i> are available for advisory record
       locking. Record locking shall be supported for regular files, and may
       be supported for other files.

       F_GETLK       Get the first lock which blocks the lock description
                     pointed to by the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as a
                     pointer to type <b>struct flock</b>, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.
                     The information retrieved shall overwrite the
                     information passed to <i>fcntl</i>() in the structure <b>flock</b>.
                     If no lock is found that would prevent this lock from
                     being created, then the structure shall be left
                     unchanged except for the lock type which shall be set
                     to F_UNLCK.

       F_SETLK       Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock
                     description pointed to by the third argument, <i>arg</i>,
                     taken as a pointer to type <b>struct flock</b>, defined in
                     <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.  F_SETLK can establish shared (or read)
                     locks (F_RDLCK) or exclusive (or write) locks
                     (F_WRLCK), as well as to remove either type of lock
                     (F_UNLCK). F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, and F_UNLCK are defined in
                     <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.  If a shared or exclusive lock cannot be
                     set, <i>fcntl</i>() shall return immediately with a return
                     value of −1.

       F_SETLKW      This command shall be equivalent to F_SETLK except that
                     if a shared or exclusive lock is blocked by other
                     locks, the thread shall wait until the request can be
                     satisfied. If a signal that is to be caught is received
                     while <i>fcntl</i>() is waiting for a region, <i>fcntl</i>() shall be
                     interrupted. Upon return from the signal handler,
                     <i>fcntl</i>() shall return −1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>, and
                     the lock operation shall not be done.

       Additional implementation-defined values for <i>cmd</i> may be defined in
       <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.  Their names shall start with F_.

       When a shared lock is set on a segment of a file, other processes
       shall be able to set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it.
       A shared lock prevents any other process from setting an exclusive
       lock on any portion of the protected area. A request for a shared
       lock shall fail if the file descriptor was not opened with read
       access.

       An exclusive lock shall prevent any other process from setting a
       shared lock or an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected
       area. A request for an exclusive lock shall fail if the file
       descriptor was not opened with write access.

       The structure <b>flock </b>describes the type (<i>l_type</i>), starting offset
       (<i>l_whence</i>), relative offset (<i>l_start</i>), size (<i>l_len</i>), and process ID
       (<i>l_pid</i>) of the segment of the file to be affected.

       The value of <i>l_whence</i> is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to indicate
       that the relative offset <i>l_start</i> bytes shall be measured from the
       start of the file, current position, or end of the file,
       respectively. The value of <i>l_len</i> is the number of consecutive bytes
       to be locked. The value of <i>l_len</i> may be negative (where the
       definition of <b>off_t </b>permits negative values of <i>l_len</i>).  The <i>l_pid</i>
       field is only used with F_GETLK to return the process ID of the
       process holding a blocking lock. After a successful F_GETLK request,
       when a blocking lock is found, the values returned in the <b>flock</b>
       structure shall be as follows:

       <i>l_type</i>    Type of blocking lock found.

       <i>l_whence</i>  SEEK_SET.

       <i>l_start</i>   Start of the blocking lock.

       <i>l_len</i>     Length of the blocking lock.

       <i>l_pid</i>     Process ID of the process that holds the blocking lock.

       If the command is F_SETLKW and the process must wait for another
       process to release a lock, then the range of bytes to be locked shall
       be determined before the <i>fcntl</i>() function blocks. If the file size or
       file descriptor seek offset change while <i>fcntl</i>() is blocked, this
       shall not affect the range of bytes locked.

       If <i>l_len</i> is positive, the area affected shall start at <i>l_start</i> and
       end at <i>l_start</i>+<i>l_len</i>−1.  If <i>l_len</i> is negative, the area affected
       shall start at <i>l_start</i>+<i>l_len</i> and end at <i>l_start</i>−1.  Locks may start
       and extend beyond the current end of a file, but shall not extend
       before the beginning of the file. A lock shall be set to extend to
       the largest possible value of the file offset for that file by
       setting <i>l_len</i> to 0. If such a lock also has <i>l_start</i> set to 0 and
       <i>l_whence</i> is set to SEEK_SET, the whole file shall be locked.

       There shall be at most one type of lock set for each byte in the
       file.  Before a successful return from an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW
       request when the calling process has previously existing locks on
       bytes in the region specified by the request, the previous lock type
       for each byte in the specified region shall be replaced by the new
       lock type. As specified above under the descriptions of shared locks
       and exclusive locks, an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request (respectively)
       shall fail or block when another process has existing locks on bytes
       in the specified region and the type of any of those locks conflicts
       with the type specified in the request.

       All locks associated with a file for a given process shall be removed
       when a file descriptor for that file is closed by that process or the
       process holding that file descriptor terminates. Locks are not
       inherited by a child process.

       A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked
       region is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of
       another process. If the system detects that sleeping until a locked
       region is unlocked would cause a deadlock, <i>fcntl</i>() shall fail with an
       <b>[EDEADLK] </b>error.

       An unlock (F_UNLCK) request in which <i>l_len</i> is non-zero and the offset
       of the last byte of the requested segment is the maximum value for an
       object of type <b>off_t</b>, when the process has an existing lock in which
       <i>l_len</i> is 0 and which includes the last byte of the requested segment,
       shall be treated as a request to unlock from the start of the
       requested segment with an <i>l_len</i> equal to 0. Otherwise, an unlock
       (F_UNLCK) request shall attempt to unlock only the requested segment.

       When the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the
       behavior of <i>fcntl</i>() shall be the same as for a regular file except
       the effect of the following values for the argument <i>cmd</i> shall be
       unspecified: F_SETFL, F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the <i>fcntl</i>()
       function is unspecified.

       Upon successful completion, the value returned shall depend on <i>cmd</i> as
       follows:

       F_DUPFD     A new file descriptor.

       F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC
                   A new file descriptor.

       F_GETFD     Value of flags defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.  The return value
                   shall not be negative.

       F_SETFD     Value other than −1.

       F_GETFL     Value of file status flags and access modes. The return
                   value is not negative.

       F_SETFL     Value other than −1.

       F_GETLK     Value other than −1.

       F_SETLK     Value other than −1.

       F_SETLKW    Value other than −1.

       F_GETOWN    Value of the socket owner process or process group; this
                   will not be −1.

       F_SETOWN    Value other than −1.

       Otherwise, −1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.

       The <i>fcntl</i>() function shall fail if:

              to wait for that lock to become free would cause a deadlock.

   <b>Locking and Unlocking a File</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to place a lock on bytes 100
       to 109 of a file and then later remove it. F_SETLK is used to perform
       a non-blocking lock request so that the process does not have to wait
       if an incompatible lock is held by another process; instead the
       process can take some other action.

           <b>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</b>
           <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>
           <b>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</b>
           <b>#include &lt;errno.h&gt;</b>
           <b>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</b>

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               int fd;
               struct flock fl;

               fd = open("testfile", O_RDWR);
               if (fd == -1)
                   /* Handle error */;

               /* Make a non-blocking request to place a write lock
                  on bytes 100-109 of testfile */

               fl.l_type = F_WRLCK;
               fl.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
               fl.l_start = 100;
               fl.l_len = 10;

               if (fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &amp;fl) == −1) {
                   if (errno == EACCES || errno == EAGAIN) {
                       printf("Already locked by another process\n");

                       /* We can't get the lock at the moment */

                   } else {
                       /* Handle unexpected error */;
                   }
               } else { /* Lock was granted... */

                   /* Perform I/O on bytes 100 to 109 of file */

                   /* Unlock the locked bytes */

                   fl.l_type = F_UNLCK;
                   fl.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
                   fl.l_start = 100;
                   fl.l_len = 10;
                   if (fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &amp;fl) == −1)
                       /* Handle error */;
               }
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           } /* main */

   <b>Setting the Close-on-Exec Flag</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to set the close-on-exec flag
       for the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.

           <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>
           <b>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</b>
           <b>...</b>
               <b>int flags;</b>

               flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFD);
               if (flags == −1)
                   /* Handle error */;
               flags |= FD_CLOEXEC;
               if (fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, flags) == −1)
                   /* Handle error */;"

       The <i>arg</i> values to F_GETFD, F_SETFD, F_GETFL, and F_SETFL all
       represent flag values to allow for future growth. Applications using
       these functions should do a read-modify-write operation on them,
       rather than assuming that only the values defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 are valid. It is a common error to forget this,
       particularly in the case of F_SETFD. Some implementations set
       additional file status flags to advise the application of default
       behavior, even though the application did not request these flags.

<h2><a id="RATIONALE" href="#RATIONALE"></a>RATIONALE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The ellipsis in the SYNOPSIS is the syntax specified by the ISO C
       standard for a variable number of arguments. It is used because
       System V uses pointers for the implementation of file locking
       functions.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 permits concurrent read and write access
       to file data using the <i>fcntl</i>() function; this is a change from the
       1984 /usr/group standard and early proposals. Without concurrency
       controls, this feature may not be fully utilized without occasional
       loss of data.

       Data losses occur in several ways. One case occurs when several
       processes try to update the same record, without sequencing controls;
       several updates may occur in parallel and the last writer ``wins''.
       Another case is a bit-tree or other internal list-based database that
       is undergoing reorganization. Without exclusive use to the tree
       segment by the updating process, other reading processes chance
       getting lost in the database when the index blocks are split,
       condensed, inserted, or deleted. While <i>fcntl</i>() is useful for many
       applications, it is not intended to be overly general and does not
       handle the bit-tree example well.

       This facility is only required for regular files because it is not
       appropriate for many devices such as terminals and network
       connections.

       Since <i>fcntl</i>() works with ``any file descriptor associated with that
       file, however it is obtained'', the file descriptor may have been
       inherited through a <i>fork</i>() or <i>exec</i> operation and thus may affect a
       file that another process also has open.

       The use of the open file description to identify what to lock
       requires extra calls and presents problems if several processes are
       sharing an open file description, but there are too many
       implementations of the existing mechanism for this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 to use different specifications.

       Another consequence of this model is that closing any file descriptor
       for a given file (whether or not it is the same open file description
       that created the lock) causes the locks on that file to be
       relinquished for that process. Equivalently, any close for any
       file/process pair relinquishes the locks owned on that file for that
       process. But note that while an open file description may be shared
       through <i>fork</i>(), locks are not inherited through <i>fork</i>().  Yet locks
       may be inherited through one of the <i>exec</i> functions.

       The identification of a machine in a network environment is outside
       the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008. Thus, an <i>l_sysid</i> member,
       such as found in System V, is not included in the locking structure.

       Changing of lock types can result in a previously locked region being
       split into smaller regions.

       Mandatory locking was a major feature of the 1984 /usr/group
       standard.

       For advisory file record locking to be effective, all processes that
       have access to a file must cooperate and use the advisory mechanism
       before doing I/O on the file. Enforcement-mode record locking is
       important when it cannot be assumed that all processes are
       cooperating.  For example, if one user uses an editor to update a
       file at the same time that a second user executes another process
       that updates the same file and if only one of the two processes is
       using advisory locking, the processes are not cooperating.
       Enforcement-mode record locking would protect against accidental
       collisions.

       Secondly, advisory record locking requires a process using locking to
       bracket each I/O operation with lock (or test) and unlock operations.
       With enforcement-mode file and record locking, a process can lock the
       file once and unlock when all I/O operations have been completed.
       Enforcement-mode record locking provides a base that can be enhanced;
       for example, with sharable locks. That is, the mechanism could be
       enhanced to allow a process to lock a file so other processes could
       read it, but none of them could write it.

       Mandatory locks were omitted for several reasons:

        1. Mandatory lock setting was done by multiplexing the set-group-ID
           bit in most implementations; this was confusing, at best.

        2. The relationship to file truncation as supported in 4.2 BSD was
           not well specified.

        3. Any publicly readable file could be locked by anyone. Many
           historical implementations keep the password database in a
           publicly readable file. A malicious user could thus prohibit
           logins. Another possibility would be to hold open a long-distance
           telephone line.

        4. Some demand-paged historical implementations offer memory mapped
           files, and enforcement cannot be done on that type of file.

       Since sleeping on a region is interrupted with any signal, <i>alarm</i>()
       may be used to provide a timeout facility in applications requiring
       it. This is useful in deadlock detection. Since implementation of
       full deadlock detection is not always feasible, the <b>[EDEADLK] </b>error
       was made optional.
