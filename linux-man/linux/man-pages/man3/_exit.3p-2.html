       For <i>_Exit</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The value of <i>status</i> may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, or any
       other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is,
       <i>status</i> &amp; 0377) shall be available to a waiting parent process.

       The <i>_Exit</i>() and <i>_exit</i>() functions shall be functionally equivalent.

       The <i>_Exit</i>() and <i>_exit</i>() functions shall not call functions registered
       with <i>atexit</i>() nor any registered signal handlers.  Open streams shall
       not be flushed.  Whether open streams are closed (without flushing)
       is implementation-defined. Finally, the calling process shall be
       terminated with the consequences described below.

   <b>Consequences of Process Termination</b>
       Process termination caused by any reason shall have the following
       consequences:

       <b>Note:     </b>These consequences are all extensions to the ISO C standard
                 and are not further CX shaded. However, functionality
                 relating to the XSI option is shaded.

        *  All of the file descriptors, directory streams, conversion
           descriptors, and message catalog descriptors open in the calling
           process shall be closed.

        *  If the parent process of the calling process is executing a
           <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>(), and has neither set its
           SA_NOCLDWAIT flag nor set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN, it shall be
           notified of termination of the calling process and the low-order
           eight bits (that is, bits 0377) of <i>status</i> shall be made available
           to it. If the parent is not waiting, the child's status shall be
           made available to it when the parent subsequently executes
           <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>().

           The semantics of the <i>waitid</i>() function shall be equivalent to
           <i>wait</i>().

        *  If the parent process of the calling process is not executing a
           <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>(), and has neither set its
           SA_NOCLDWAIT flag nor set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN, the calling process
           shall be transformed into a <i>zombie process</i>.  A <i>zombie process</i> is
           an inactive process and it shall be deleted at some later time
           when its parent process executes <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>().

           The semantics of the <i>waitid</i>() function shall be equivalent to
           <i>wait</i>().

        *  Termination of a process does not directly terminate its
           children. The sending of a SIGHUP signal as described below
           indirectly terminates children in some circumstances.

        *  Either:

           If the implementation supports the SIGCHLD signal, a SIGCHLD
           shall be sent to the parent process.

           Or:

           If the parent process has set its SA_NOCLDWAIT flag, or set
           SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN, the status shall be discarded, and the
           lifetime of the calling process shall end immediately. If
           SA_NOCLDWAIT is set, it is implementation-defined whether a
           SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent process.

        *  The parent process ID of all of the existing child processes and
           zombie processes of the calling process shall be set to the
           process ID of an implementation-defined system process. That is,
           these processes shall be inherited by a special system process.

        *  Each attached shared-memory segment is detached and the value of
           <i>shm_nattch</i> (see <i>shmget</i>()) in the data structure associated with
           its shared memory ID shall be decremented by 1.

        *  For each semaphore for which the calling process has set a <i>semadj</i>
           value (see <i>semop</i>()), that value shall be added to the <i>semval</i> of
           the specified semaphore.

        *  If the process is a controlling process, the SIGHUP signal shall
           be sent to each process in the foreground process group of the
           controlling terminal belonging to the calling process.

        *  If the process is a controlling process, the controlling terminal
           associated with the session shall be disassociated from the
           session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling process.

        *  If the exit of the process causes a process group to become
           orphaned, and if any member of the newly-orphaned process group
           is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal
           shall be sent to each process in the newly-orphaned process
           group.

        *  All open named semaphores in the calling process shall be closed
           as if by appropriate calls to <i>sem_close</i>().

        *  Any memory locks established by the process via calls to
           <i>mlockall</i>() or <i>mlock</i>() shall be removed. If locked pages in the
           address space of the calling process are also mapped into the
           address spaces of other processes and are locked by those
           processes, the locks established by the other processes shall be
           unaffected by the call by this process to <i>_Exit</i>() or <i>_exit</i>().

        *  Memory mappings that were created in the process shall be
           unmapped before the process is destroyed.

        *  Any blocks of typed memory that were mapped in the calling
           process shall be unmapped, as if <i>munmap</i>() was implicitly called
           to unmap them.

        *  All open message queue descriptors in the calling process shall
           be closed as if by appropriate calls to <i>mq_close</i>().

        *  Any outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O operations may be
           canceled. Those asynchronous I/O operations that are not canceled
           shall complete as if the <i>_Exit</i>() or <i>_exit</i>() operation had not yet
           occurred, but any associated signal notifications shall be
           suppressed. The <i>_Exit</i>() or <i>_exit</i>() operation may block awaiting
           such I/O completion. Whether any I/O is canceled, and which I/O
           may be canceled upon <i>_Exit</i>() or <i>_exit</i>(), is implementation-
           defined.

        *  Threads terminated by a call to <i>_Exit</i>() or <i>_exit</i>() shall not
           invoke their cancellation cleanup handlers or per-thread data
           destructors.

        *  If the calling process is a trace controller process, any trace
           streams that were created by the calling process shall be shut
           down as described by the <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function, and
           mapping of trace event names to trace event type identifiers of
           any process built for these trace streams may be deallocated.

   <b>Process Termination</b>
       Early proposals drew a distinction between normal and abnormal
       process termination. Abnormal termination was caused only by certain
       signals and resulted in implementation-defined ``actions'', as
       discussed below.  Subsequent proposals distinguished three types of
       termination: <i>normal termination</i> (as in the current specification),
       <i>simple abnormal termination</i>, and <i>abnormal termination with actions</i>.
       Again the distinction between the two types of abnormal termination
       was that they were caused by different signals and that
       implementation-defined actions would result in the latter case. Given
       that these actions were completely implementation-defined, the early
       proposals were only saying when the actions could occur and how their
       occurrence could be detected, but not what they were. This was of
       little or no use to conforming applications, and thus the distinction
       is not made in this volume of POSIX.1‐2008.

       The implementation-defined actions usually include, in most
       historical implementations, the creation of a file named <b>core </b>in the
       current working directory of the process. This file contains an image
       of the memory of the process, together with descriptive information
       about the process, perhaps sufficient to reconstruct the state of the
       process at the receipt of the signal.

       There is a potential security problem in creating a <b>core </b>file if the
       process was set-user-ID and the current user is not the owner of the
       program, if the process was set-group-ID and none of the user's
       groups match the group of the program, or if the user does not have
       permission to write in the current directory. In this situation, an
       implementation either should not create a <b>core </b>file or should make it
       unreadable by the user.

       Despite the silence of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 on this feature,
       applications are advised not to create files named <b>core </b>because of
       potential conflicts in many implementations. Some implementations use
       a name other than <b>core </b>for the file; for example, by appending the
       process ID to the filename.

   <b>Terminating a Process</b>
       It is important that the consequences of process termination as
       described occur regardless of whether the process called <i>_exit</i>()
       (perhaps indirectly through <i>exit</i>()) or instead was terminated due to
       a signal or for some other reason.  Note that in the specific case of
       <i>exit</i>() this means that the <i>status</i> argument to <i>exit</i>() is treated in
       the same way as the <i>status</i> argument to <i>_exit</i>().

       A language other than C may have other termination primitives than
       the C-language <i>exit</i>() function, and programs written in such a
       language should use its native termination primitives, but those
       should have as part of their function the behavior of <i>_exit</i>() as
       described. Implementations in languages other than C are outside the
       scope of this version of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, however.

       As required by the ISO C standard, using <b>return </b>from <i>main</i>() has the
       same behavior (other than with respect to language scope issues) as
       calling <i>exit</i>() with the returned value. Reaching the end of the
       <i>main</i>() function has the same behavior as calling <b>exit</b>(0).

       A value of zero (or EXIT_SUCCESS, which is required to be zero) for
       the argument <i>status</i> conventionally indicates successful termination.
       This corresponds to the specification for <i>exit</i>() in the ISO C
       standard. The convention is followed by utilities such as <i>make</i> and
       various shells, which interpret a zero status from a child process as
       success. For this reason, applications should not call <b>exit</b>(0) or
       <i>_exit</i>(0) when they terminate unsuccessfully; for example, in signal-
       catching functions.

       Historically, the implementation-defined process that inherits
       children whose parents have terminated without waiting on them is
       called <i>init</i> and has a process ID of 1.

       The sending of a SIGHUP to the foreground process group when a
       controlling process terminates corresponds to somewhat different
       historical implementations. In System V, the kernel sends a SIGHUP on
       termination of (essentially) a controlling process. In 4.2 BSD, the
       kernel does not send SIGHUP in a case like this, but the termination
       of a controlling process is usually noticed by a system daemon, which
       arranges to send a SIGHUP to the foreground process group with the
       <i>vhangup</i>() function. However, in 4.2 BSD, due to the behavior of the
       shells that support job control, the controlling process is usually a
       shell with no other processes in its process group. Thus, a change to
       make <i>_exit</i>() behave this way in such systems should not cause
       problems with existing applications.

       The termination of a process may cause a process group to become
       orphaned in either of two ways.  The connection of a process group to
       its parent(s) outside of the group depends on both the parents and
       their children. Thus, a process group may be orphaned by the
       termination of the last connecting parent process outside of the
       group or by the termination of the last direct descendant of the
       parent process(es). In either case, if the termination of a process
       causes a process group to become orphaned, processes within the group
       are disconnected from their job control shell, which no longer has
       any information on the existence of the process group. Stopped
       processes within the group would languish forever. In order to avoid
       this problem, newly orphaned process groups that contain stopped
       processes are sent a SIGHUP signal and a SIGCONT signal to indicate
       that they have been disconnected from their session.  The SIGHUP
       signal causes the process group members to terminate unless they are
       catching or ignoring SIGHUP. Under most circumstances, all of the
       members of the process group are stopped if any of them are stopped.

       The action of sending a SIGHUP and a SIGCONT signal to members of a
       newly orphaned process group is similar to the action of 4.2 BSD,
       which sends SIGHUP and SIGCONT to each stopped child of an exiting
       process.  If such children exit in response to the SIGHUP, any
       additional descendants receive similar treatment at that time. In
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, the signals are sent to the entire
       process group at the same time. Also, in this volume of POSIX.1‐2008,
       but not in 4.2 BSD, stopped processes may be orphaned, but may be
       members of a process group that is not orphaned; therefore, the
       action taken at <i>_exit</i>() must consider processes other than child
       processes.

       It is possible for a process group to be orphaned by a call to
       <i>setpgid</i>() or <i>setsid</i>(), as well as by process termination. This volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008 does not require sending SIGHUP and SIGCONT in those
       cases, because, unlike process termination, those cases are not
       caused accidentally by applications that are unaware of job control.
       An implementation can choose to send SIGHUP and SIGCONT in those
       cases as an extension; such an extension must be documented as
       required in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.

       The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard adds the <i>_Exit</i>() function that results
       in immediate program termination without triggering signals or
       <i>atexit</i>()-registered functions. In POSIX.1‐2008, this is equivalent to
       the <i>_exit</i>() function.
