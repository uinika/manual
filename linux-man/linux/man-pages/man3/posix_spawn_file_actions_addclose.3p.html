       These functions shall add or delete a close or open action to a spawn
       file actions object.

       A spawn file actions object is of type <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_t</b>
       (defined in <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>) and is used to specify a series of actions to
       be performed by a <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operation in order
       to arrive at the set of open file descriptors for the child process
       given the set of open file descriptors of the parent.  POSIX.1‐2008
       does not define comparison or assignment operators for the type
       <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_t</b>.

       A spawn file actions object, when passed to <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
       <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), shall specify how the set of open file descriptors in
       the calling process is transformed into a set of potentially open
       file descriptors for the spawned process. This transformation shall
       be as if the specified sequence of actions was performed exactly
       once, in the context of the spawned process (prior to execution of
       the new process image), in the order in which the actions were added
       to the object; additionally, when the new process image is executed,
       any file descriptor (from this new set) which has its FD_CLOEXEC flag
       set shall be closed (see <a href="posix_spawn.3p.html">posix_spawn(3p)</a>).

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>() function shall add a <i>close</i>
       action to the object referenced by <i>file_actions</i> that shall cause the
       file descriptor <i>fildes</i> to be closed (as if <i>close</i>(<i>fildes</i>) had been
       called) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object.

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</i>() function shall add an <i>open</i>
       action to the object referenced by <i>file_actions</i> that shall cause the
       file named by <i>path</i> to be opened (as if <i>open</i>(<i>path</i>, <i>oflag</i>, <i>mode</i>) had
       been called, and the returned file descriptor, if not <i>fildes</i>, had
       been changed to <i>fildes</i>) when a new process is spawned using this file
       actions object. If <i>fildes</i> was already an open file descriptor, it
       shall be closed before the new file is opened.

       The string described by <i>path</i> shall be copied by the
       <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</i>() function.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RETURN_VALUE" href="#RETURN_VALUE"></a>RETURN VALUE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre>
<h2><a id="ERRORS" href="#ERRORS"></a>ERRORS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The value specified by <i>fildes</i> is negative or greater than or
              equal to {OPEN_MAX}.

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The value specified by <i>fildes</i> is negative.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value specified by <i>file_actions</i> is invalid.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions
              object.

       It shall not be considered an error for the <i>fildes</i> argument passed to
       these functions to specify a file descriptor for which the specified
       operation could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such
       error will be detected when the associated file actions object is
       later used during a <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operation.

<h2><a id="EXAMPLES" href="#EXAMPLES"></a>EXAMPLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>

       These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided
       on all implementations.

       Implementations may use file descriptors that must be inherited into
       child processes for the child process to remain conforming, such as
       for message catalog or tracing purposes. Therefore, an application
       that calls <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>() with an arbitrary
       integer risks non-conforming behavior, and this function can only
       portably be used to close file descriptor values that the application
       has obtained through explicit actions, or for the three file
       descriptors corresponding to the standard file streams. In order to
       avoid a race condition of leaking an unintended file descriptor into
       a child process, an application should consider opening all file
       descriptors with the FD_CLOEXEC bit set unless the file descriptor is
       intended to be inherited across <i>exec</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RATIONALE" href="#RATIONALE"></a>RATIONALE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       A spawn file actions object may be initialized to contain an ordered
       sequence of <i>close</i>(), <i>dup2</i>(), and <i>open</i>() operations to be used by
       <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() to arrive at the set of open file
       descriptors inherited by the spawned process from the set of open
       file descriptors in the parent at the time of the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
       <i>posix_spawnp</i>() call. It had been suggested that the <i>close</i>() and
       <i>dup2</i>() operations alone are sufficient to rearrange file descriptors,
       and that files which need to be opened for use by the spawned process
       can be handled either by having the calling process open them before
       the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() call (and close them after), or
       by passing pathnames to the spawned process (in <i>argv</i>) so that it may
       open them itself. The standard developers recommend that applications
       use one of these two methods when practical, since detailed error
       status on a failed open operation is always available to the
       application this way. However, the standard developers feel that
       allowing a spawn file actions object to specify open operations is
       still appropriate because:

        1. It is consistent with equivalent POSIX.5 (Ada) functionality.

        2. It supports the I/O redirection paradigm commonly employed by
           POSIX programs designed to be invoked from a shell. When such a
           program is the child process, it may not be designed to open
           files on its own.

        3. It allows file opens that might otherwise fail or violate file
           ownership/access rights if executed by the parent process.

       Regarding 2. above, note that the spawn open file action provides to
       <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() the same capability that the shell
       redirection operators provide to <i>system</i>(), only without the
       intervening execution of a shell; for example:

           <b>system ("myprog &lt;file1 3&lt;file2");</b>

       Regarding 3. above, note that if the calling process needs to open
       one or more files for access by the spawned process, but has
       insufficient spare file descriptors, then the open action is
       necessary to allow the <i>open</i>() to occur in the context of the child
       process after other file descriptors have been closed (that must
       remain open in the parent).

       Additionally, if a parent is executed from a file having a ``set-
       user-id'' mode bit set and the POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag is set in
       the spawn attributes, a file created within the parent process will
       (possibly incorrectly) have the parent's effective user ID as its
       owner, whereas a file created via an <i>open</i>() action during
       <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() will have the parent's real ID as its
       owner; and an open by the parent process may successfully open a file
       to which the real user should not have access or fail to open a file
       to which the real user should have access.

   <b>File Descriptor Mapping</b>
       The standard developers had originally proposed using an array which
       specified the mapping of child file descriptors back to those of the
       parent. It was pointed out by the ballot group that it is not
       possible to reshuffle file descriptors arbitrarily in a library
       implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() without provision
       for one or more spare file descriptor entries (which simply may not
       be available). Such an array requires that an implementation develop
       a complex strategy to achieve the desired mapping without
       inadvertently closing the wrong file descriptor at the wrong time.

       It was noted by a member of the Ada Language Bindings working group
       that the approved Ada Language <i>Start_Process</i> family of POSIX process
       primitives use a caller-specified set of file actions to alter the
       normal <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i> semantics for inheritance of file descriptors in a
       very flexible way, yet no such problems exist because the burden of
       determining how to achieve the final file descriptor mapping is
       completely on the application. Furthermore, although the file actions
       interface appears frightening at first glance, it is actually quite
       simple to implement in either a library or the kernel.

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>() function is not required to
       check whether the file descriptor is less than {OPEN_MAX} because on
       some implementations {OPEN_MAX} reflects the RLIMIT_NOFILE soft limit
       and therefore calling <i>setrlimit</i>() to reduce this limit can result in
       an {OPEN_MAX} value less than or equal to an already open file
       descriptor.  Applications need to be able to close such file
       descriptors on spawn.  On implementations where {OPEN_MAX} does not
       change, it is recommended that <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>()
       should return <b>[EBADF] </b>if <i>fildes</i> is greater than or equal to
       {OPEN_MAX}.
