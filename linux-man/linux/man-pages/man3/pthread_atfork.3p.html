       The <i>pthread_atfork</i>() function shall declare fork handlers to be
       called before and after <i>fork</i>(), in the context of the thread that
       called <i>fork</i>().  The <i>prepare</i> fork handler shall be called before
       <i>fork</i>() processing commences. The <i>parent</i> fork handle shall be called
       after <i>fork</i>() processing completes in the parent process. The <i>child</i>
       fork handler shall be called after <i>fork</i>() processing completes in the
       child process. If no handling is desired at one or more of these
       three points, the corresponding fork handler address(es) may be set
       to NULL.

       The order of calls to <i>pthread_atfork</i>() is significant. The <i>parent</i> and
       <i>child</i> fork handlers shall be called in the order in which they were
       established by calls to <i>pthread_atfork</i>().  The <i>prepare</i> fork handlers
       shall be called in the opposite order.

       There are at least two serious problems with the semantics of <i>fork</i>()
       in a multi-threaded program. One problem has to do with state (for
       example, memory) covered by mutexes. Consider the case where one
       thread has a mutex locked and the state covered by that mutex is
       inconsistent while another thread calls <i>fork</i>().  In the child, the
       mutex is in the locked state (locked by a nonexistent thread and thus
       can never be unlocked). Having the child simply reinitialize the
       mutex is unsatisfactory since this approach does not resolve the
       question about how to correct or otherwise deal with the inconsistent
       state in the child.

       It is suggested that programs that use <i>fork</i>() call an <i>exec</i> function
       very soon afterwards in the child process, thus resetting all states.
       In the meantime, only a short list of async-signal-safe library
       routines are promised to be available.

       Unfortunately, this solution does not address the needs of multi-
       threaded libraries. Application programs may not be aware that a
       multi-threaded library is in use, and they feel free to call any
       number of library routines between the <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> calls, just as
       they always have. Indeed, they may be extant single-threaded programs
       and cannot, therefore, be expected to obey new restrictions imposed
       by the threads library.

       On the other hand, the multi-threaded library needs a way to protect
       its internal state during <i>fork</i>() in case it is re-entered later in
       the child process. The problem arises especially in multi-threaded
       I/O libraries, which are almost sure to be invoked between the <i>fork</i>()
       and <i>exec</i> calls to effect I/O redirection. The solution may require
       locking mutex variables during <i>fork</i>(), or it may entail simply
       resetting the state in the child after the <i>fork</i>() processing
       completes.

       The <i>pthread_atfork</i>() function was intended to provide multi-threaded
       libraries with a means to protect themselves from innocent
       application programs that call <i>fork</i>(), and to provide multi-threaded
       application programs with a standard mechanism for protecting
       themselves from <i>fork</i>() calls in a library routine or the application
       itself.

       The expected usage was that the prepare handler would acquire all
       mutex locks and the other two fork handlers would release them.

       For example, an application could have supplied a prepare routine
       that acquires the necessary mutexes the library maintains and
       supplied child and parent routines that release those mutexes, thus
       ensuring that the child would have got a consistent snapshot of the
       state of the library (and that no mutexes would have been left
       stranded). This is good in theory, but in reality not practical. Each
       and every mutex and lock in the process must be located and locked.
       Every component of a program including third-party components must
       participate and they must agree who is responsible for which mutex or
       lock. This is especially problematic for mutexes and locks in
       dynamically allocated memory. All mutexes and locks internal to the
       implementation must be locked, too. This possibly delays the thread
       calling <i>fork</i>() for a long time or even indefinitely since uses of
       these synchronization objects may not be under control of the
       application. A final problem to mention here is the problem of
       locking streams. At least the streams under control of the system
       (like <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, <i>stderr</i>) must be protected by locking the stream
       with <i>flockfile</i>().  But the application itself could have done that,
       possibly in the same thread calling <i>fork</i>().  In this case, the
       process will deadlock.

       Alternatively, some libraries might have been able to supply just a
       <i>child</i> routine that reinitializes the mutexes in the library and all
       associated states to some known value (for example, what it was when
       the image was originally executed). This approach is not possible,
       though, because implementations are allowed to fail <i>*_init</i>() and
       <i>*_destroy</i>() calls for mutexes and locks if the mutex or lock is still
       locked. In this case, the <i>child</i> routine is not able to reinitialize
       the mutexes and locks.

       When <i>fork</i>() is called, only the calling thread is duplicated in the
       child process.  Synchronization variables remain in the same state in
       the child as they were in the parent at the time <i>fork</i>() was called.
       Thus, for example, mutex locks may be held by threads that no longer
       exist in the child process, and any associated states may be
       inconsistent. The intention was that the parent process could have
       avoided this by explicit code that acquires and releases locks
       critical to the child via <i>pthread_atfork</i>().  In addition, any
       critical threads would have needed to be recreated and reinitialized
       to the proper state in the child (also via <i>pthread_atfork</i>()).

       A higher-level package may acquire locks on its own data structures
       before invoking lower-level packages. Under this scenario, the order
       specified for fork handler calls allows a simple rule of
       initialization for avoiding package deadlock: a package initializes
       all packages on which it depends before it calls the <i>pthread_atfork</i>()
       function for itself.

       As explained, there is no suitable solution for functionality which
       requires non-atomic operations to be protected through mutexes and
       locks. This is why the POSIX.1 standard since the 1996 release
       requires that the child process after <i>fork</i>() in a multi-threaded
       process only calls async-signal-safe interfaces.
