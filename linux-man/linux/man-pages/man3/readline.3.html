       <b>readline </b>will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
       <b>prompt </b>as a prompt.  If <b>prompt </b>is <b>NULL </b>or the empty string, no prompt
       is issued.  The line returned is allocated with <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>; the caller
       must free it when finished.  The line returned has the final newline
       removed, so only the text of the line remains.

       <b>readline </b>offers editing capabilities while the user is entering the
       line.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of
       emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.

       This manual page describes only the most basic use of <b>readline</b>.  Much
       more functionality is available; see <i>The GNU Readline Library</i> and <i>The</i>
       <i>GNU History Library</i> for additional information.

<h2><a id="RETURN_VALUE" href="#RETURN_VALUE"></a>RETURN VALUE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>readline </b>returns the text of the line read.  A blank line returns the
       empty string.  If <b>EOF </b>is encountered while reading a line, and the
       line is empty, <b>NULL </b>is returned.  If an <b>EOF </b>is read with a non-empty
       line, it is treated as a newline.

<h2><a id="NOTATION" href="#NOTATION"></a>NOTATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       An Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys
       are denoted by C-<i>key</i>, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, <i>meta</i>
       keys are denoted by M-<i>key</i>, so M-x means Meta-X.  (On keyboards
       without a <i>meta</i> key, M-<i>x</i> means ESC <i>x</i>, i.e., press the Escape key then
       the <i>x</i> key.  This makes ESC the <i>meta prefix</i>.  The combination M-C-<i>x</i>
       means ESC-Control-<i>x</i>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control
       key while pressing the <i>x</i> key.)

       Readline commands may be given numeric <i>arguments</i>, which normally act
       as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the
       argument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument to a
       command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) causes
       that command to act in a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior
       with arguments deviates from this are noted below.

       When a command is described as <i>killing</i> text, the text deleted is
       saved for possible future retrieval (<i>yanking</i>).  The killed text is
       saved in a <i>kill ring</i>.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be
       accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands
       which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

<h2><a id="INITIALIZATION_FILE" href="#INITIALIZATION_FILE"></a>INITIALIZATION FILE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file
       (the <i>inputrc</i> file).  The name of this file is taken from the value of
       the <b>INPUTRC </b>environment variable.  If that variable is unset, the
       default is <i>~/.inputrc</i>.  If that file  does not exist or cannot be
       read, the ultimate default is <i>/etc/inputrc</i>.  When a program which
       uses the readline library starts up, the init file is read, and the
       key bindings and variables are set.  There are only a few basic
       constructs allowed in the readline init file.  Blank lines are
       ignored.  Lines beginning with a <b># </b>are comments.  Lines beginning
       with a <b>$ </b>indicate conditional constructs.  Other lines denote key
       bindings and variable settings.  Each program using this library may
       add its own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into the <i>inputrc</i> would make M-C-u execute the readline command
       <i>universal-argument</i>.

       The following symbolic character names are recognized while
       processing key bindings: <i>DEL</i>, <i>ESC</i>, <i>ESCAPE</i>, <i>LFD</i>, <i>NEWLINE</i>, <i>RET</i>, <i>RETURN</i>,
       <i>RUBOUT</i>, <i>SPACE</i>, <i>SPC</i>, and <i>TAB</i>.

       In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a
       string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <i>macro</i>).

   <b>Key Bindings</b>
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <i>inputrc</i> file is
       simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text
       of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The name
       may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly
       with <i>Meta-</i> or <i>Control-</i> prefixes, or as a key sequence.  The name and
       key sequence are separated by a colon.  There can be no whitespace
       between the name and the colon.

       When using the form <b>keyname</b>:<i>function-name</i> or <i>macro</i>, <i>keyname</i> is the
       name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "&gt; output"

       In the above example, <i>C-u</i> is bound to the function
       <b>universal-argument</b>, <i>M-DEL</i> is bound to the function
       <b>backward-kill-word</b>, and <i>C-o</i> is bound to run the macro expressed on
       the right hand side (that is, to insert the text ``&gt; output'' into
       the line).

       In the second form, <b>"keyseq"</b>:<i>function-name</i> or <i>macro</i>, <b>keyseq </b>differs
       from <b>keyname </b>above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence
       may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some
       GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example,
       but the symbolic character names are not recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, <i>C-u</i> is again bound to the function
       <b>universal-argument</b>.  <i>C-x C-r</i> is bound to the function
       <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <i>ESC [ 1 1 ~</i> is bound to insert the text
       ``Function Key 1''.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when
       specifying key sequences is
              <b>\C-    </b>control prefix
              <b>\M-    </b>meta prefix
              <b>\e     </b>an escape character
              <b>\\     </b>backslash
              <b>\"     </b>literal ", a double quote
              <b>\'     </b>literal ', a single quote

       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of
       backslash escapes is available:
              <b>\a     </b>alert (bell)
              <b>\b     </b>backspace
              <b>\d     </b>delete
              <b>\f     </b>form feed
              <b>\n     </b>newline
              <b>\r     </b>carriage return
              <b>\t     </b>horizontal tab
              <b>\v     </b>vertical tab
              <b>\</b><i>nnn</i>   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value
                     <i>nnn</i> (one to three digits)
              <b>\x</b><i>HH</i>   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal
                     value <i>HH</i> (one or two hex digits)

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes should be
       used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be
       a function name.  In the macro body, the backslash escapes described
       above are expanded.  Backslash will quote any other character in the
       macro text, including " and '.

       <b>Bash </b>allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or
       modified with the <b>bind </b>builtin command.  The editing mode may be
       switched during interactive use by using the <b>-o </b>option to the <b>set</b>
       builtin command.  Other programs using this library provide similar
       mechanisms.  The <i>inputrc</i> file may be edited and re-read if a program
       does not provide any other means to incorporate new bindings.

   <b>Variables</b>
       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its
       behavior.  A variable may be set in the <i>inputrc</i> file with a statement
       of the form

              <b>set </b><i>variable-name value</i>

       Except where noted, readline variables can take the values <b>On </b>or <b>Off</b>
       (without regard to case).  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.
       When a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-
       insensitive), and "1" are equivalent to <b>On</b>.  All other values are
       equivalent to <b>Off</b>.  The variables and their default values are:

       <b>bell-style (audible)</b>
              Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal
              bell.  If set to <b>none</b>, readline never rings the bell.  If set
              to <b>visible</b>, readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
              If set to <b>audible</b>, readline attempts to ring the terminal's
              bell.
       <b>bind-tty-special-chars (On)</b>
              If set to <b>On </b>(the default), readline attempts to bind the
              control characters   treated specially by the kernel's
              terminal driver to their readline equivalents.
       <b>blink-matching-paren (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to
              an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
       <b>colored-completion-prefix (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, when listing completions, readline displays the
              common prefix of the set of possible completions using a
              different color.  The color definitions are taken from the
              value of the <b>LS_COLORS </b>environment variable.
       <b>colored-stats (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline displays possible completions using
              different colors to indicate their file type.  The color
              definitions are taken from the value of the <b>LS_COLORS</b>
              environment variable.
       <b>comment-begin (``#'')</b>
              The string that is inserted in <b>vi </b>mode when the <b>insert-comment</b>
              command is executed.  This command is bound to <b>M-# </b>in emacs
              mode and to <b># </b>in vi command mode.
       <b>completion-display-width (-1)</b>
              The number of screen columns used to display possible matches
              when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is
              less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A
              value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.
              The default value is -1.
       <b>completion-ignore-case (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline performs filename matching and
              completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
       <b>completion-map-case (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, and <b>completion-ignore-case </b>is enabled, readline
              treats hyphens (<i>-</i>) and underscores (<i>_</i>) as equivalent when
              performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       <b>completion-prefix-display-length</b>(0)
              The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of
              possible completions that is displayed without modification.
              When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer
              than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying
              possible completions.
       <b>completion-query-items (100)</b>
              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the
              number of possible completions generated by the
              <b>possible-completions </b>command.  It may be set to any integer
              value greater than or equal to zero.  If the number of
              possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of
              this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to
              view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal.
              A negative value causes readline to never ask.
       <b>convert-meta (On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will convert characters with the eighth
              bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit
              and prefixing it with an escape character (in effect, using
              escape as the <i>meta prefix</i>).  The default is <i>On</i>, but readline
              will set it to <i>Off</i> if the locale contains eight-bit
              characters.
       <b>disable-completion (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will inhibit word completion.
              Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if
              they had been mapped to <b>self-insert</b>.
       <b>echo-control-characters (On)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, on operating systems that indicate they
              support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a
              signal generated from the keyboard.
       <b>editing-mode (emacs)</b>
              Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings
              similar to <i>Emacs</i> or <i>vi</i>.  <b>editing-mode </b>can be set to either
              <b>emacs </b>or <b>vi</b>.
       <b>enable-bracketed-paste (Off)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, readline will configure the terminal in a way
              that will enable it to insert each paste into the editing
              buffer as a single string of characters, instead of treating
              each character as if it had been read from the keyboard.  This
              can prevent pasted characters from being interpreted as
              editing commands.
       <b>enable-keypad (Off)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, readline will try to enable the application
              keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable
              the arrow keys.
       <b>enable-meta-key (On)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, readline will try to enable any meta modifier
              key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many
              terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
       <b>expand-tilde (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, tilde expansion is performed when readline
              attempts word completion.
       <b>history-preserve-point (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, the history code attempts to place point at the
              same location on each history line retrieved with <b>previous-</b>
              <b>history </b>or <b>next-history</b>.
       <b>history-size (unset)</b>
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history
              list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries are
              deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less
              than zero, the number of history entries is not limited.  By
              default, the number of history entries is not limited.  If an
              attempt is made to set <i>history-size</i> to a non-numeric value,
              the maximum number of history entries will be set to 500.
       <b>horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, makes readline use a single line for display,
              scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when
              it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping
              to a new line.
       <b>input-meta (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is,
              it will not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),
              regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
              name <b>meta-flag </b>is a synonym for this variable.  The default is
              <i>Off</i>, but readline will set it to <i>On</i> if the locale contains
              eight-bit characters.
       <b>isearch-terminators (``C-[ C-J'')</b>
              The string of characters that should terminate an incremental
              search without subsequently executing the character as a
              command.  If this variable has not been given a value, the
              characters <i>ESC</i> and <i>C-J</i> will terminate an incremental search.
       <b>keymap (emacs)</b>
              Set the current readline keymap.  The set of legal keymap
              names is <i>emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,</i>
              <i>vi-move, vi-command</i>, and <i>vi-insert</i>.  <i>vi</i> is equivalent to <i>vi-</i>
              <i>command</i>; <i>emacs</i> is equivalent to <i>emacs-standard</i>.  The default
              value is <i>emacs</i>.  The value of <b>editing-mode </b>also affects the
              default keymap.
       <b>emacs-mode-string (@)</b>
              This string is displayed immediately before the last line of
              the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The
              value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of
              meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is
              available.  Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end
              sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to
              embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       <b>keyseq-timeout (500)</b>
              Specifies the duration <i>readline</i> will wait for a character when
              reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a
              complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take
              additional input to complete a longer key sequence).  If no
              input is received within the timeout, <i>readline</i> will use the
              shorter but complete key sequence.  The value is specified in
              milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that <i>readline</i> will wait
              one second for additional input.  If this variable is set to a
              value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value,
              <i>readline</i> will wait until another key is pressed to decide
              which key sequence to complete.
       <b>mark-directories (On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       <b>mark-modified-lines (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, history lines that have been modified are
              displayed with a preceding asterisk (<b>*</b>).
       <b>mark-symlinked-directories (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, completed names which are symbolic links to
              directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of
              <b>mark-directories</b>).
       <b>match-hidden-files (On)</b>
              This variable, when set to <b>On</b>, causes readline to match files
              whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing
              filename completion.  If set to <b>Off</b>, the leading `.' must be
              supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.
       <b>menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, menu completion displays the common prefix of
              the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before
              cycling through the list.
       <b>output-meta (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will display characters with the eighth
              bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
              sequence.  The default is <i>Off</i>, but readline will set it to <i>On</i>
              if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
       <b>page-completions (On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline uses an internal <i>more</i>-like pager to
              display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
       <b>print-completions-horizontally (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will display completions with matches
              sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down
              the screen.
       <b>revert-all-at-newline (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, readline will undo all changes to history lines
              before returning when <b>accept-line </b>is executed.  By default,
              history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists
              across calls to <b>readline</b>.
       <b>show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)</b>
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.
              If set to <b>On</b>, words which have more than one possible
              completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead
              of ringing the bell.
       <b>show-all-if-unmodified (Off)</b>
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions
              in a fashion similar to <b>show-all-if-ambiguous</b>.  If set to <b>On</b>,
              words which have more than one possible completion without any
              possible partial completion (the possible completions don't
              share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed
              immediately instead of ringing the bell.
       <b>show-mode-in-prompt (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, add a character to the beginning of the prompt
              indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi
              insertion.  The mode strings are user-settable.
       <b>skip-completed-text (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, this alters the default completion behavior when
              inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when
              performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled,
              readline does not insert characters from the completion that
              match characters after point in the word being completed, so
              portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
       <b>vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))</b>
              This string is displayed immediately before the last line of
              the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in
              command mode.  The value is expanded like a key binding, so
              the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash
              escape sequences is available.  Use the \1 and \2 escapes to
              begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can
              be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode
              string.
       <b>vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))</b>
              This string is displayed immediately before the last line of
              the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in
              insertion mode.  The value is expanded like a key binding, so
              the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash
              escape sequences is available.  Use the \1 and \2 escapes to
              begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can
              be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode
              string.
       <b>visible-stats (Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, a character denoting a file's type as reported
              by <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> is appended to the filename when listing possible
              completions.

   <b>Conditional Constructs</b>
       Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
       compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings
       and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests.  There
       are four parser directives used.

       <b>$if    </b>The <b>$if </b>construct allows bindings to be made based on the
              editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application
              using readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of
              the line; no characters are required to isolate it.

              <b>mode   </b>The <b>mode= </b>form of the <b>$if </b>directive is used to test
                     whether readline is in emacs or vi mode.  This may be
                     used in conjunction with the <b>set keymap </b>command, for
                     instance, to set bindings in the <i>emacs-standard</i> and
                     <i>emacs-ctlx</i> keymaps only if readline is starting out in
                     emacs mode.

              <b>term   </b>The <b>term= </b>form may be used to include terminal-specific
                     key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output
                     by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right
                     side of the <b>= </b>is tested against the full name of the
                     terminal and the portion of the terminal name before
                     the first <b>-</b>.  This allows <i>sun</i> to match both <i>sun</i> and
                     <i>sun-cmd</i>, for instance.

              <b>application</b>
                     The <b>application </b>construct is used to include
                     application-specific settings.  Each program using the
                     readline library sets the <i>application name</i>, and an
                     initialization file can test for a particular value.
                     This could be used to bind key sequences to functions
                     useful for a specific program.  For instance, the
                     following command adds a key sequence that quotes the
                     current or previous word in <b>bash</b>:

                     <b>$if </b>Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     <b>$endif</b>

       <b>$endif </b>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an
              <b>$if </b>command.

       <b>$else  </b>Commands in this branch of the <b>$if </b>directive are executed if
              the test fails.

       <b>$include</b>
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and
              reads commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the
              following directive would read <i>/etc/inputrc</i>:

              <b>$include  </b><i>/etc/inputrc</i>
</pre>
<h2><a id="SEARCHING" href="#SEARCHING"></a>SEARCHING  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
       for lines containing a specified string.  There are two search modes:
       <i>incremental</i> and <i>non-incremental</i>.

       Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
       search string.  As each character of the search string is typed,
       readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string
       typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters
       as needed to find the desired history entry.  To search backward in
       the history for a particular string, type <b>C-r</b>.  Typing <b>C-s </b>searches
       forward through the history.  The characters present in the value of
       the <b>isearch-terminators </b>variable are used to terminate an incremental
       search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the <i>Escape</i>
       and <b>C-J </b>characters will terminate an incremental search.  <b>C-G </b>will
       abort an incremental search and restore the original line.  When the
       search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string
       becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history list, type <b>C-s </b>or <b>C-r</b>
       as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the history
       for the next line matching the search string typed so far.  Any other
       key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search
       and execute that command.  For instance, a newline will terminate the
       search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the
       history list.  A movement command will terminate the search, make the
       last line found the current line, and begin editing.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before
       starting to search for matching history lines.  The search string may
       be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

<h2><a id="EDITING_COMMANDS" href="#EDITING_COMMANDS"></a>EDITING COMMANDS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default
       key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an
       accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.

       In the following descriptions, <i>point</i> refers to the current cursor
       position, and <i>mark</i> refers to a cursor position saved by the <b>set-mark</b>
       command.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as the
       <i>region</i>.

   <b>Commands for Moving</b>
       <b>beginning-of-line (C-a)</b>
              Move to the start of the current line.
       <b>end-of-line (C-e)</b>
              Move to the end of the line.
       <b>forward-char (C-f)</b>
              Move forward a character.
       <b>backward-char (C-b)</b>
              Move back a character.
       <b>forward-word (M-f)</b>
              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed
              of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
       <b>backward-word (M-b)</b>
              Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words
              are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
       <b>clear-screen (C-l)</b>
              Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the
              screen.  With an argument, refresh the current line without
              clearing the screen.
       <b>redraw-current-line</b>
              Refresh the current line.

   <b>Commands for Manipulating the History</b>
       <b>accept-line (Newline, Return)</b>
              Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this
              line is non-empty, it may be added to the history list for
              future recall with <b>add_history()</b>.  If the line is a modified
              history line, the history line is restored to its original
              state.
       <b>previous-history (C-p)</b>
              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back
              in the list.
       <b>next-history (C-n)</b>
              Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward
              in the list.
       <b>beginning-of-history (M-&lt;)</b>
              Move to the first line in the history.
       <b>end-of-history (M-&gt;)</b>
              Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently
              being entered.
       <b>reverse-search-history (C-r)</b>
              Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up'
              through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental
              search.
       <b>forward-search-history (C-s)</b>
              Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down'
              through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental
              search.
       <b>non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)</b>
              Search backward through the history starting at the current
              line using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by
              the user.
       <b>non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)</b>
              Search forward through the history using a non-incremental
              search for a string supplied by the user.
       <b>history-search-backward</b>
              Search backward through the history for the string of
              characters between the start of the current line and the
              current cursor position (the <i>point</i>).  The search string must
              match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a non-
              incremental search.
       <b>history-search-forward</b>
              Search forward through the history for the string of
              characters between the start of the current line and the
              point.  The search string must match at the beginning of a
              history line.  This is a non-incremental search.
       <b>history-substring-search-backward</b>
              Search backward through the history for the string of
              characters between the start of the current line and the
              current cursor position (the <i>point</i>).  The search string may
              match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-incremental
              search.
       <b>history-substring-search-forward</b>
              Search forward through the history for the string of
              characters between the start of the current line and the
              point.  The search string may match anywhere in a history
              line.  This is a non-incremental search.
       <b>yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)</b>
              Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the
              second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument
              <i>n</i>, insert the <i>n</i>th word from the previous command (the words in
              the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument
              inserts the <i>n</i>th word from the end of the previous command.
              Once the argument <i>n</i> is computed, the argument is extracted as
              if the "!<i>n</i>" history expansion had been specified.
       <b>yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)</b>
              Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last
              word of the previous history entry).  With a numeric argument,
              behave exactly like <b>yank-nth-arg</b>.  Successive calls to
              <b>yank-last-arg </b>move back through the history list, inserting
              the last word (or the word specified by the argument to the
              first call) of each line in turn.  Any numeric argument
              supplied to these successive calls determines the direction to
              move through the history.  A negative argument switches the
              direction through the history (back or forward).  The history
              expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument, as
              if the "!$" history expansion had been specified.

   <b>Commands for Changing Text</b>
       <i>end-of-file</i> <b>(usually C-d)</b>
              The character indicating end-of-file as set, for example, by
              ``stty''.  If this character is read when there are no
              characters on the line, and point is at the beginning of the
              line, Readline interprets it as the end of input and returns
              <b>EOF</b>.
       <b>delete-char (C-d)</b>
              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to
              the same character as the tty <b>EOF </b>character, as <b>C-d </b>commonly
              is, see above for the effects.
       <b>backward-delete-char (Rubout)</b>
              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric
              argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
       <b>forward-backward-delete-char</b>
              Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at
              the end of the line, in which case the character behind the
              cursor is deleted.
       <b>quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)</b>
              Add the next character that you type to the line verbatim.
              This is how to insert characters like <b>C-q</b>, for example.
       <b>tab-insert (M-TAB)</b>
              Insert a tab character.
       <b>self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)</b>
              Insert the character typed.
       <b>transpose-chars (C-t)</b>
              Drag the character before point forward over the character at
              point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end
              of the line, then this transposes the two characters before
              point.  Negative arguments have no effect.
       <b>transpose-words (M-t)</b>
              Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving
              point over that word as well.  If point is at the end of the
              line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       <b>upcase-word (M-u)</b>
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
              argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       <b>downcase-word (M-l)</b>
              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
              argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       <b>capitalize-word (M-c)</b>
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative
              argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       <b>overwrite-mode</b>
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric
              argument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-
              positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This
              command affects only <b>emacs </b>mode; <b>vi </b>mode does overwrite
              differently.  Each call to <i>readline()</i> starts in insert mode.
              In overwrite mode, characters bound to <b>self-insert </b>replace the
              text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.
              Characters bound to <b>backward-delete-char </b>replace the character
              before point with a space.  By default, this command is
              unbound.

   <b>Killing and Yanking</b>
       <b>kill-line (C-k)</b>
              Kill the text from point to the end of the line.
       <b>backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)</b>
              Kill backward to the beginning of the line.
       <b>unix-line-discard (C-u)</b>
              Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.  The
              killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       <b>kill-whole-line</b>
              Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point
              is.
       <b>kill-word (M-d)</b>
              Kill from point the end of the current word, or if between
              words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the
              same as those used by <b>forward-word</b>.
       <b>backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)</b>
              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as
              those used by <b>backward-word</b>.
       <b>unix-word-rubout (C-w)</b>
              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word
              boundary.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       <b>unix-filename-rubout</b>
              Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash
              character as the word boundaries.  The killed text is saved on
              the kill-ring.
       <b>delete-horizontal-space (M-\)</b>
              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       <b>kill-region</b>
              Kill the text between the point and <i>mark</i> (saved cursor
              position).  This text is referred to as the <i>region</i>.
       <b>copy-region-as-kill</b>
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer.
       <b>copy-backward-word</b>
              Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word
              boundaries are the same as <b>backward-word</b>.
       <b>copy-forward-word</b>
              Copy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word
              boundaries are the same as <b>forward-word</b>.
       <b>yank (C-y)</b>
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       <b>yank-pop (M-y)</b>
              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works
              following <b>yank </b>or <b>yank-pop</b>.

   <b>Numeric Arguments</b>
       <b>digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)</b>
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start
              a new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       <b>universal-argument</b>
              This is another way to specify an argument.  If this command
              is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading
              minus sign, those digits define the argument.  If the command
              is followed by digits, executing <b>universal-argument </b>again ends
              the numeric argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special
              case, if this command is immediately followed by a character
              that is neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count for
              the next command is multiplied by four.  The argument count is
              initially one, so executing this function the first time makes
              the argument count four, a second time makes the argument
              count sixteen, and so on.

   <b>Completing</b>
       <b>complete (TAB)</b>
              Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  The
              actual completion performed is application-specific.  <b>Bash</b>,
              for instance, attempts completion treating the text as a
              variable (if the text begins with <b>$</b>), username (if the text
              begins with <b>~</b>), hostname (if the text begins with <b>@</b>), or
              command (including aliases and functions) in turn.  If none of
              these produces a match, filename completion is attempted.
              <b>Gdb</b>, on the other hand, allows completion of program functions
              and variables, and only attempts filename completion under
              certain circumstances.
       <b>possible-completions (M-?)</b>
              List the possible completions of the text before point.  When
              displaying completions, readline sets the number of columns
              used for display to the value of <b>completion-display-width</b>, the
              value of the environment variable <b>COLUMNS</b>, or the screen
              width, in that order.
       <b>insert-completions (M-*)</b>
              Insert all completions of the text before point that would
              have been generated by <b>possible-completions</b>.
       <b>menu-complete</b>
              Similar to <b>complete</b>, but replaces the word to be completed
              with a single match from the list of possible completions.
              Repeated execution of <b>menu-complete </b>steps through the list of
              possible completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the
              end of the list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to
              the setting of <b>bell-style</b>) and the original text is restored.
              An argument of <i>n</i> moves <i>n</i> positions forward in the list of
              matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward
              through the list.  This command is intended to be bound to
              <b>TAB</b>, but is unbound by default.
       <b>menu-complete-backward</b>
              Identical to <b>menu-complete</b>, but moves backward through the
              list of possible completions, as if <b>menu-complete </b>had been
              given a negative argument.  This command is unbound by
              default.
       <b>delete-char-or-list</b>
              Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning
              or end of the line (like <b>delete-char</b>).  If at the end of the
              line, behaves identically to <b>possible-completions</b>.

   <b>Keyboard Macros</b>
       <b>start-kbd-macro (C-x ()</b>
              Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard
              macro.
       <b>end-kbd-macro (C-x ))</b>
              Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard
              macro and store the definition.
       <b>call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)</b>
              Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the
              characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.
              <b>print-last-kbd-macro () </b>Print the last keyboard macro defined
              in a format suitable for the <i>inputrc</i> file.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)</b>
              Read in the contents of the <i>inputrc</i> file, and incorporate any
              bindings or variable assignments found there.
       <b>abort (C-g)</b>
              Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal's bell
              (subject to the setting of <b>bell-style</b>).
       <b>do-uppercase-version (M-a, M-b, M-</b><i>x</i><b>, ...)</b>
              If the metafied character <i>x</i> is lowercase, run the command that
              is bound to the corresponding uppercase character.
       <b>prefix-meta (ESC)</b>
              Metafy the next character typed.  <b>ESC f </b>is equivalent to
              <b>Meta-f</b>.
       <b>undo (C-_, C-x C-u)</b>
              Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
       <b>revert-line (M-r)</b>
              Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing
              the <b>undo </b>command enough times to return the line to its
              initial state.
       <b>tilde-expand (M-&amp;)</b>
              Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
       <b>set-mark (C-@, M-&lt;space&gt;)</b>
              Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
              the mark is set to that position.
       <b>exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)</b>
              Swap the point with the mark.  The current cursor position is
              set to the saved position, and the old cursor position is
              saved as the mark.
       <b>character-search (C-])</b>
              A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence
              of that character.  A negative count searches for previous
              occurrences.
       <b>character-search-backward (M-C-])</b>
              A character is read and point is moved to the previous
              occurrence of that character.  A negative count searches for
              subsequent occurrences.
       <b>skip-csi-sequence</b>
              Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as
              those defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences
              begin with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.
              If this sequence is bound to "\[", keys producing such
              sequences will have no effect unless explicitly bound to a
              readline command, instead of inserting stray characters into
              the editing buffer.  This is unbound by default, but usually
              bound to ESC-[.
       <b>insert-comment (M-#)</b>
              Without a numeric argument, the value of the readline
              <b>comment-begin </b>variable is inserted at the beginning of the
              current line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command
              acts as a toggle: if the characters at the beginning of the
              line do not match the value of <b>comment-begin</b>, the value is
              inserted, otherwise the characters in <b>comment-begin </b>are
              deleted from the beginning of the line.  In either case, the
              line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.  The default
              value of <b>comment-begin </b>makes the current line a shell comment.
              If a numeric argument causes the comment character to be
              removed, the line will be executed by the shell.
       <b>dump-functions</b>
              Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the
              readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
              the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
              of an <i>inputrc</i> file.
       <b>dump-variables</b>
              Print all of the settable variables and their values to the
              readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
              the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
              of an <i>inputrc</i> file.
       <b>dump-macros</b>
              Print all of the readline key sequences bound to macros and
              the strings they output.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
              the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part
              of an <i>inputrc</i> file.
       <b>emacs-editing-mode (C-e)</b>
              When in <b>vi </b>command mode, this causes a switch to <b>emacs </b>editing
              mode.
       <b>vi-editing-mode (M-C-j)</b>
              When in <b>emacs </b>editing mode, this causes a switch to <b>vi </b>editing
              mode.

       The following is a list of the default emacs and vi bindings.
       Characters with the eighth bit set are written as M-&lt;character&gt;, and
       are referred to as <i>metafied</i> characters.  The printable ASCII
       characters not mentioned in the list of emacs standard bindings are
       bound to the <b>self-insert </b>function, which just inserts the given
       character into the input line.  In vi insertion mode, all characters
       not specifically mentioned are bound to <b>self-insert</b>.  Characters
       assigned to signal generation by <a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</a> or the terminal driver, such
       as C-Z or C-C, retain that function.  Upper and lower case metafied
       characters are bound to the same function in the emacs mode meta
       keymap.  The remaining characters are unbound, which causes readline
       to ring the bell (subject to the setting of the <b>bell-style </b>variable).

       If you find a bug in <b>readline, </b>you should report it.  But first, you
       should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the
       latest version of the <b>readline </b>library that you have.

       Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a bug
       report to <i>bug-readline</i>@<i>gnu.org</i>.  If you have a fix, you are welcome
       to mail that as well!  Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports
       may be mailed to <i>bug-readline</i>@<i>gnu.org</i> or posted to the Usenet
       newsgroup <b>gnu.bash.bug</b>.

       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be
       directed to <i>chet.ramey@case.edu</i>.
