           siginfo_t *restrict <i>info</i>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <i>timeout</i>);

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       except that if none of the signals specified by <i>set</i> are pending,
       <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall wait for the time interval specified in the
       <b>timespec </b>structure referenced by <i>timeout</i>.  If the <b>timespec </b>structure
       pointed to by <i>timeout</i> is zero-valued and if none of the signals
       specified by <i>set</i> are pending, then <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall return
       immediately with an error. If <i>timeout</i> is the null pointer, the
       behavior is unspecified.  If the Monotonic Clock option is supported,
       the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock shall be used to measure the time interval
       specified by the <i>timeout</i> argument.

       The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function selects the pending signal from the set
       specified by <i>set</i>.  Should any of multiple pending signals in the
       range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the lowest
       numbered one. The selection order between realtime and non-realtime
       signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is
       unspecified. If no signal in <i>set</i> is pending at the time of the call,
       the calling thread shall be suspended until one or more signals in
       <i>set</i> become pending or until it is interrupted by an unblocked, caught
       signal.

       The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>sigwait</i>()
       function if the <i>info</i> argument is NULL. If the <i>info</i> argument is non-
       NULL, the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>sigwait</i>(),
       except that the selected signal number shall be stored in the
       <i>si_signo</i> member, and the cause of the signal shall be stored in the
       <i>si_code</i> member. If any value is queued to the selected signal, the
       first such queued value shall be dequeued and, if the <i>info</i> argument
       is non-NULL, the value shall be stored in the <i>si_value</i> member of
       <i>info</i>.  The system resource used to queue the signal shall be released
       and returned to the system for other use. If no value is queued, the
       content of the <i>si_value</i> member is undefined. If no further signals
       are queued for the selected signal, the pending indication for that
       signal shall be reset.

<h2><a id="RETURN_VALUE" href="#RETURN_VALUE"></a>RETURN VALUE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Upon successful completion (that is, one of the signals specified by
       <i>set</i> is pending or is generated) <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() and <i>sigtimedwait</i>()
       shall return the selected signal number. Otherwise, the function
       shall return a value of −1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre>
<h2><a id="ERRORS" href="#ERRORS"></a>ERRORS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>No signal specified by <i>set</i> was generated within the specified
              timeout period.

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal. It
              shall be documented in system documentation whether this error
              causes these functions to fail.

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function may also fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>timeout</i> argument specified a <i>tv_nsec</i> value less than zero
              or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       An implementation should only check for this error if no signal is
       pending in <i>set</i> and it is necessary to wait.

</pre>
<h2><a id="APPLICATION_USAGE" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE"></a>APPLICATION USAGE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function times out and returns an <b>[EAGAIN] </b>error.
       Application developers should note that this is inconsistent with
       other functions such as <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() that return
       <b>[ETIMEDOUT]</b>.

       Note that in order to ensure that generated signals are queued and
       signal values passed to <i>sigqueue</i>() are available in <i>si_value</i>,
       applications which use <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() or <i>sigtimedwait</i>() need to set
       the SA_SIGINFO flag for each signal in the set (see <i>Section 2.4</i>,
       <i>Signal Concepts</i>).  This means setting each signal to be handled by a
       three-argument signal-catching function, even if the handler will
       never be called.  It is not possible (portably) to set a signal
       handler to SIG_DFL while setting the SA_SIGINFO flag, because
       assigning to the <i>sa_handler</i> member of <b>struct sigaction </b>instead of the
       <i>sa_sigaction</i> member would result in undefined behavior, and SIG_DFL
       need not be assignment-compatible with <i>sa_sigaction</i>.  Even if an
       assignment of SIG_DFL to <i>sa_sigaction</i> is accepted by the compiler,
       the implementation need not treat this value as special—it could just
       be taken as the address of a signal-catching function.
</pre>
<h2><a id="RATIONALE" href="#RATIONALE"></a>RATIONALE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Existing programming practice on realtime systems uses the ability to
       pause waiting for a selected set of events and handle the first event
       that occurs in-line instead of in a signal-handling function. This
       allows applications to be written in an event-directed style similar
       to a state machine. This style of programming is useful for
       largescale transaction processing in which the overall throughput of
       an application and the ability to clearly track states are more
       important than the ability to minimize the response time of
       individual event handling.

       It is possible to construct a signal-waiting macro function out of
       the realtime signal function mechanism defined in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008. However, such a macro has to include the definition of
       a generalized handler for all signals to be waited on. A significant
       portion of the overhead of handler processing can be avoided if the
       signal-waiting function is provided by the kernel. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 therefore provides two signal-waiting functions—one that
       waits indefinitely and one with a timeout—as part of the overall
       realtime signal function specification.

       The specification of a function with a timeout allows an application
       to be written that can be broken out of a wait after a set period of
       time if no event has occurred. It was argued that setting a timer
       event before the wait and recognizing the timer event in the wait
       would also implement the same functionality, but at a lower
       performance level. Because of the performance degradation associated
       with the user-level specification of a timer event and the subsequent
       cancellation of that timer event after the wait completes for a valid
       event, and the complexity associated with handling potential race
       conditions associated with the user-level method, the separate
       function has been included.

       Note that the semantics of the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function are nearly
       identical to that of the <i>sigwait</i>() function defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008. The only difference is that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() returns the
       queued signal value in the <i>value</i> argument. The return of the queued
       value is required so that applications can differentiate between
       multiple events queued to the same signal number.

       The two distinct functions are being maintained because some
       implementations may choose to implement the POSIX Threads Extension
       functions and not implement the queued signals extensions. Note,
       though, that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() does not return the queued value if the
       <i>value</i> argument is NULL, so the POSIX Threads Extension <i>sigwait</i>()
       function can be implemented as a macro on <i>sigwaitinfo</i>().

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function was separated from the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       function to address concerns regarding the overloading of the <i>timeout</i>
       pointer to indicate indefinite wait (no timeout), timed wait, and
       immediate return, and concerns regarding consistency with other
       functions where the conditional and timed waits were separate
       functions from the pure blocking function. The semantics of
       <i>sigtimedwait</i>() are specified such that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() could be
       implemented as a macro with a null pointer for <i>timeout</i>.

       The <i>sigwait</i> functions provide a synchronous mechanism for threads to
       wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One important question was
       how many threads that are suspended in a call to a <i>sigwait</i>() function
       for a signal should return from the call when the signal is sent.
       Four choices were considered:

        1. Return an error for multiple simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i>
           functions for the same signal.

        2. One or more threads return.

        3. All waiting threads return.

        4. Exactly one thread returns.

       Prohibiting multiple calls to <i>sigwait</i>() for the same signal was felt
       to be overly restrictive. The ``one or more'' behavior made
       implementation of conforming packages easy at the expense of forcing
       POSIX threads clients to protect against multiple simultaneous calls
       to <i>sigwait</i>() in application code in order to achieve predictable
       behavior. There was concern that the ``all waiting threads'' behavior
       would result in ``signal broadcast storms'', consuming excessive CPU
       resources by replicating the signals in the general case.
       Furthermore, no convincing examples could be presented that delivery
       to all was either simpler or more powerful than delivery to one.

       Thus, the consensus was that exactly one thread that was suspended in
       a call to a <i>sigwait</i> function for a signal should return when that
       signal occurs. This is not an onerous restriction as:

        *  A multi-way signal wait can be built from the single-way wait.

        *  Signals should only be handled by application-level code, as
           library routines cannot guess what the application wants to do
           with signals generated for the entire process.

        *  Applications can thus arrange for a single thread to wait for any
           given signal and call any needed routines upon its arrival.

       In an application that is using signals for interprocess
       communication, signal processing is typically done in one place.
       Alternatively, if the signal is being caught so that process cleanup
       can be done, the signal handler thread can call separate process
       cleanup routines for each portion of the application. Since the
       application main line started each portion of the application, it is
       at the right abstraction level to tell each portion of the
       application to clean up.

       Certainly, there exist programming styles where it is logical to
       consider waiting for a single signal in multiple threads. A simple
       <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() routine can be constructed to achieve this goal. A
       possible implementation would be to have each <i>sigwait_multiple</i>()
       caller registered as having expressed interest in a set of signals.
       The caller then waits on a thread-specific condition variable. A
       single server thread calls a <i>sigwait</i>() function on the union of all
       registered signals. When the <i>sigwait</i>() function returns, the
       appropriate state is set and condition variables are broadcast. New
       <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() callers may cause the pending <i>sigwait</i>() call to be
       canceled and reissued in order to update the set of signals being
       waited for.
