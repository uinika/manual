<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>shm_open</i>() function shall establish a connection between a shared
       memory object and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file
       description that refers to the shared memory object and a file
       descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file
       descriptor is used by other functions to refer to that shared memory
       object. The <i>name</i> argument points to a string naming a shared memory
       object. It is unspecified whether the name appears in the file system
       and is visible to other functions that take pathnames as arguments.
       The <i>name</i> argument conforms to the construction rules for a pathname,
       except that the interpretation of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than the
       leading &lt;slash&gt; character in <i>name</i> is implementation-defined, and that
       the length limits for the <i>name</i> argument are implementation-defined
       and need not be the same as the pathname limits {PATH_MAX} and
       {NAME_MAX}.  If <i>name</i> begins with the &lt;slash&gt; character, then
       processes calling <i>shm_open</i>() with the same value of <i>name</i> refer to the
       same shared memory object, as long as that name has not been removed.
       If <i>name</i> does not begin with the &lt;slash&gt; character, the effect is
       implementation-defined.

       If successful, <i>shm_open</i>() shall return a file descriptor for the
       shared memory object that is the lowest numbered file descriptor not
       currently open for that process.  The open file description is new,
       and therefore the file descriptor does not share it with any other
       processes. It is unspecified whether the file offset is set. The
       FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file
       descriptor is set.

       The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
       description are according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.  The <i>oflag</i> argument
       is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags defined in the
       <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header. Applications specify exactly one of the first two
       values (access modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:

       O_RDONLY    Open for read access only.

       O_RDWR      Open for read or write access.

       Any combination of the remaining flags may be specified in the value
       of <i>oflag</i>:

       O_CREAT     If the shared memory object exists, this flag has no
                   effect, except as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise,
                   the shared memory object is created. The user ID of the
                   shared memory object shall be set to the effective user
                   ID of the process. The group ID of the shared memory
                   object shall be set to the effective group ID of the
                   process; however, if the <i>name</i> argument is visible in the
                   file system, the group ID may be set to the group ID of
                   the containing directory. The permission bits of the
                   shared memory object shall be set to the value of the
                   <i>mode</i> argument except those set in the file mode creation
                   mask of the process. When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the
                   file permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified.
                   The <i>mode</i> argument does not affect whether the shared
                   memory object is opened for reading, for writing, or for
                   both. The shared memory object has a size of zero.

       O_EXCL      If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <i>shm_open</i>() fails if the
                   shared memory object exists. The check for the existence
                   of the shared memory object and the creation of the
                   object if it does not exist is atomic with respect to
                   other processes executing <i>shm_open</i>() naming the same
                   shared memory object with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If
                   O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is
                   undefined.

       O_TRUNC     If the shared memory object exists, and it is
                   successfully opened O_RDWR, the object shall be truncated
                   to zero length and the mode and owner shall be unchanged
                   by this function call. The result of using O_TRUNC with
                   O_RDONLY is undefined.

       When a shared memory object is created, the state of the shared
       memory object, including all data associated with the shared memory
       object, persists until the shared memory object is unlinked and all
       other references are gone. It is unspecified whether the name and
       shared memory object state remain valid after a system reboot.

       When the Memory Mapped Files option is supported, the normal <i>open</i>()
       call is used to obtain a descriptor to a file to be mapped according
       to existing practice with <i>mmap</i>().  When the Shared Memory Objects
       option is supported, the <i>shm_open</i>() function shall obtain a
       descriptor to the shared memory object to be mapped.

       There is ample precedent for having a file descriptor represent
       several types of objects. In the POSIX.1‐1990 standard, a file
       descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a FIFO, a tty, or a
       directory. Many implementations simply have an operations vector,
       which is indexed by the file descriptor type and does very different
       operations. Note that in some cases the file descriptor passed to
       generic operations on file descriptors is returned by <i>open</i>() or
       <i>creat</i>() and in some cases returned by alternate functions, such as
       <i>pipe</i>().  The latter technique is used by <i>shm_open</i>().

       Note that such shared memory objects can actually be implemented as
       mapped files. In both cases, the size can be set after the open using
       <i>ftruncate</i>().  The <i>shm_open</i>() function itself does not create a shared
       object of a specified size because this would duplicate an extant
       function that set the size of an object referenced by a file
       descriptor.

       On implementations where memory objects are implemented using the
       existing file system, the <i>shm_open</i>() function may be implemented
       using a macro that invokes <i>open</i>(), and the <i>shm_unlink</i>() function may
       be implemented using a macro that invokes <i>unlink</i>().

       For implementations without a permanent file system, the definition
       of the name of the memory objects is allowed not to survive a system
       reboot. Note that this allows systems with a permanent file system to
       implement memory objects as data structures internal to the
       implementation as well.

       On implementations that choose to implement memory objects using
       memory directly, a <i>shm_open</i>() followed by an <i>ftruncate</i>() and <i>close</i>()
       can be used to preallocate a shared memory area and to set the size
       of that preallocation. This may be necessary for systems without
       virtual memory hardware support in order to ensure that the memory is
       contiguous.

       The set of valid open flags to <i>shm_open</i>() was restricted to O_RDONLY,
       O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these could be easily
       implemented on most memory mapping systems. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 is silent on the results if the implementation cannot
       supply the requested file access because of implementation-defined
       reasons, including hardware ones.

       The error conditions <b>[EACCES] </b>and <b>[ENOTSUP] </b>are provided to inform
       the application that the implementation cannot complete a request.

       <b>[EACCES] </b>indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
       hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
       requested mode because it conflicts with another requested mode. An
       example might be that an application desires to open a memory object
       two times, mapping different areas with different access modes. If
       the implementation cannot map a single area into a process space in
       two places, which would be required if different access modes were
       required for the two areas, then the implementation may inform the
       application at the time of the second open.

       <b>[ENOTSUP] </b>indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
       hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
       requested mode at all. An example would be that the hardware of the
       implementation cannot support write-only shared memory areas.

       On all implementations, it may be desirable to restrict the location
       of the memory objects to specific file systems for performance (such
       as a RAM disk) or implementation-defined reasons (shared memory
       supported directly only on certain file systems). The <i>shm_open</i>()
       function may be used to enforce these restrictions. There are a
       number of methods available to the application to determine an
       appropriate name of the file or the location of an appropriate
       directory. One way is from the environment via <i>getenv</i>().  Another
       would be from a configuration file.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 specifies that memory objects have
       initial contents of zero when created. This is consistent with
       current behavior for both files and newly allocated memory. For those
       implementations that use physical memory, it would be possible that
       such implementations could simply use available memory and give it to
       the process uninitialized.  This, however, is not consistent with
       standard behavior for the uninitialized data area, the stack, and of
       course, files. Finally, it is highly desirable to set the allocated
       memory to zero for security reasons. Thus, initializing memory
       objects to zero is required.
