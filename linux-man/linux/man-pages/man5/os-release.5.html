       The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files contain operating
       system identification data.

       The basic file format of os-release is a newline-separated list of
       environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is
       possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however,
       beyond mere variable assignments, no shell features are supported
       (this means variable expansion is explicitly not supported), allowing
       applications to read the file without implementing a shell compatible
       execution engine. Variable assignment values must be enclosed in
       double or single quotes if they include spaces, semicolons or other
       special characters outside of A–Z, a–z, 0–9. Shell special characters
       ("$", quotes, backslash, backtick) must be escaped with backslashes,
       following shell style. All strings should be in UTF-8 format, and
       non-printable characters should not be used. It is not supported to
       concatenate multiple individually quoted strings. Lines beginning
       with "#" shall be ignored as comments.

       The file /etc/os-release takes precedence over /usr/lib/os-release.
       Applications should check for the former, and exclusively use its
       data if it exists, and only fall back to /usr/lib/os-release if it is
       missing. Applications should not read data from both files at the
       same time.  /usr/lib/os-release is the recommended place to store OS
       release information as part of vendor trees.  /etc/os-release should
       be a relative symlink to /usr/lib/os-release, to provide
       compatibility with applications only looking at /etc. A relative
       symlink instead of an absolute symlink is necessary to avoid breaking
       the link in a chroot or initrd environment such as dracut.

       os-release contains data that is defined by the operating system
       vendor and should generally not be changed by the administrator.

       As this file only encodes names and identifiers it should not be
       localized.

       The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files might be symlinks
       to other files, but it is important that the file is available from
       earliest boot on, and hence must be located on the root file system.

       For a longer rationale for os-release please refer to the
       <b>Announcement of /etc/os-release</b><b></b>[1].

       The following OS identifications parameters may be set using
       os-release:

       <i>NAME=</i>
           A string identifying the operating system, without a version
           component, and suitable for presentation to the user. If not set,
           defaults to "NAME=Linux". Example: "NAME=Fedora" or "NAME="Debian
           GNU/Linux"".

       <i>VERSION=</i>
           A string identifying the operating system version, excluding any
           OS name information, possibly including a release code name, and
           suitable for presentation to the user. This field is optional.
           Example: "VERSION=17" or "VERSION="17 (Beefy Miracle)"".

       <i>ID=</i>
           A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of
           0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system,
           excluding any version information and suitable for processing by
           scripts or usage in generated filenames. If not set, defaults to
           "ID=linux". Example: "ID=fedora" or "ID=debian".

       <i>ID_LIKE=</i>
           A space-separated list of operating system identifiers in the
           same syntax as the <i>ID=</i> setting. It should list identifiers of
           operating systems that are closely related to the local operating
           system in regards to packaging and programming interfaces, for
           example listing one or more OS identifiers the local OS is a
           derivative from. An OS should generally only list other OS
           identifiers it itself is a derivative of, and not any OSes that
           are derived from it, though symmetric relationships are possible.
           Build scripts and similar should check this variable if they need
           to identify the local operating system and the value of <i>ID=</i> is
           not recognized. Operating systems should be listed in order of
           how closely the local operating system relates to the listed
           ones, starting with the closest. This field is optional. Example:
           for an operating system with "ID=centos", an assignment of
           "ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"" would be appropriate. For an operating
           system with "ID=ubuntu", an assignment of "ID_LIKE=debian" is
           appropriate.

       <i>VERSION_CODENAME=</i>
           A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of
           0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system
           release code name, excluding any OS name information or release
           version, and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in
           generated filenames. This field is optional and may not be
           implemented on all systems. Examples: "VERSION_CODENAME=buster",
           "VERSION_CODENAME=xenial"

       <i>VERSION_ID=</i>
           A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other
           characters outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the
           operating system version, excluding any OS name information or
           release code name, and suitable for processing by scripts or
           usage in generated filenames. This field is optional. Example:
           "VERSION_ID=17" or "VERSION_ID=11.04".

       <i>PRETTY_NAME=</i>
           A pretty operating system name in a format suitable for
           presentation to the user. May or may not contain a release code
           name or OS version of some kind, as suitable. If not set,
           defaults to "PRETTY_NAME="Linux"". Example: "PRETTY_NAME="Fedora
           17 (Beefy Miracle)"".

       <i>ANSI_COLOR=</i>
           A suggested presentation color when showing the OS name on the
           console. This should be specified as string suitable for
           inclusion in the ESC [ m ANSI/ECMA-48 escape code for setting
           graphical rendition. This field is optional. Example:
           "ANSI_COLOR="0;31"" for red, or "ANSI_COLOR="1;34"" for light
           blue.

       <i>CPE_NAME=</i>
           A CPE name for the operating system, in URI binding syntax,
           following the <b>Common Platform Enumeration Specification</b><b></b>[2] as
           proposed by the NIST. This field is optional. Example:
           "CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:fedoraproject:fedora:17""

       <i>HOME_URL=</i>, <i>SUPPORT_URL=</i>, <i>BUG_REPORT_URL=</i>, <i>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=</i>
           Links to resources on the Internet related the operating system.
           <i>HOME_URL=</i> should refer to the homepage of the operating system,
           or alternatively some homepage of the specific version of the
           operating system.  <i>SUPPORT_URL=</i> should refer to the main support
           page for the operating system, if there is any. This is primarily
           intended for operating systems which vendors provide support for.
           <i>BUG_REPORT_URL=</i> should refer to the main bug reporting page for
           the operating system, if there is any. This is primarily intended
           for operating systems that rely on community QA.
           <i>PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=</i> should refer to the main privacy policy page
           for the operation system, if there is any. These settings are
           optional, and providing only some of these settings is common.
           These URLs are intended to be exposed in "About this system" UIs
           behind links with captions such as "About this Operating System",
           "Obtain Support", "Report a Bug", or "Privacy Policy". The values
           should be in <b>RFC3986 format</b><b></b>[3], and should be "http:" or "https:"
           URLs, and possibly "mailto:" or "tel:". Only one URL shall be
           listed in each setting. If multiple resources need to be
           referenced, it is recommended to provide an online landing page
           linking all available resources. Examples:
           "HOME_URL="https://fedoraproject.org/"" and
           "BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/""

       <i>BUILD_ID=</i>
           A string uniquely identifying the system image used as the origin
           for a distribution (it is not updated with system updates). The
           field can be identical between different VERSION_IDs as BUILD_ID
           is an only a unique identifier to a specific version.
           Distributions that release each update as a new version would
           only need to use VERSION_ID as each build is already distinct
           based on the VERSION_ID. This field is optional. Example:
           "BUILD_ID="2013-03-20.3"" or "BUILD_ID=201303203".

       <i>VARIANT=</i>
           A string identifying a specific variant or edition of the
           operating system suitable for presentation to the user. This
           field may be used to inform the user that the configuration of
           this system is subject to a specific divergent set of rules or
           default configuration settings. This field is optional and may
           not be implemented on all systems. Examples: "VARIANT="Server
           Edition"", "VARIANT="Smart Refrigerator Edition"" Note: this
           field is for display purposes only. The <i>VARIANT_ID</i> field should
           be used for making programmatic decisions.

       <i>VARIANT_ID=</i>
           A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of
           0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and "-"), identifying a specific variant or
           edition of the operating system. This may be interpreted by other
           packages in order to determine a divergent default configuration.
           This field is optional and may not be implemented on all systems.
           Examples: "VARIANT_ID=server", "VARIANT_ID=embedded"

       If you are reading this file from C code or a shell script to
       determine the OS or a specific version of it, use the <i>ID</i> and
       <i>VERSION_ID</i> fields, possibly with <i>ID_LIKE</i> as fallback for <i>ID</i>. When
       looking for an OS identification string for presentation to the user
       use the <i>PRETTY_NAME</i> field.

       Note that operating system vendors may choose not to provide version
       information, for example to accommodate for rolling releases. In this
       case, <i>VERSION</i> and <i>VERSION_ID</i> may be unset. Applications should not
       rely on these fields to be set.

       Operating system vendors may extend the file format and introduce new
       fields. It is highly recommended to prefix new fields with an OS
       specific name in order to avoid name clashes. Applications reading
       this file must ignore unknown fields. Example:
       "DEBIAN_BTS="debbugs://bugs.debian.org/""
