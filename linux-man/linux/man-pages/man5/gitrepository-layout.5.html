       A Git repository comes in two different flavours:

       ·   a <b>.git </b>directory at the root of the working tree;

       ·   a <b>&lt;project&gt;.git </b>directory that is a <i>bare</i> repository (i.e. without
           its own working tree), that is typically used for exchanging
           histories with others by pushing into it and fetching from it.

       <b>Note</b>: Also you can have a plain text file <b>.git </b>at the root of your
       working tree, containing <b>gitdir: &lt;path&gt; </b>to point at the real
       directory that has the repository. This mechanism is often used for a
       working tree of a submodule checkout, to allow you in the containing
       superproject to <b>git checkout </b>a branch that does not have the
       submodule. The <b>checkout </b>has to remove the entire submodule working
       tree, without losing the submodule repository.

       These things may exist in a Git repository.

       objects
           Object store associated with this repository. Usually an object
           store is self sufficient (i.e. all the objects that are referred
           to by an object found in it are also found in it), but there are
           a few ways to violate it.

            1. You could have an incomplete but locally usable repository by
               creating a shallow clone. See <a href="../man1/git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>.

            2. You could be using the <b>objects/info/alternates </b>or
               <b>$GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES </b>mechanisms to <i>borrow</i>
               objects from other object stores. A repository with this kind
               of incomplete object store is not suitable to be published
               for use with dumb transports but otherwise is OK as long as
               <b>objects/info/alternates </b>points at the object stores it
               borrows from.

               This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
               "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/objects" will be used instead.

       objects/[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]
           A newly created object is stored in its own file. The objects are
           splayed over 256 subdirectories using the first two characters of
           the sha1 object name to keep the number of directory entries in
           <b>objects </b>itself to a manageable number. Objects found here are
           often called <i>unpacked</i> (or <i>loose</i>) objects.

       objects/pack
           Packs (files that store many object in compressed form, along
           with index files to allow them to be randomly accessed) are found
           in this directory.

       objects/info
           Additional information about the object store is recorded in this
           directory.

       objects/info/packs
           This file is to help dumb transports discover what packs are
           available in this object store. Whenever a pack is added or
           removed, <b>git update-server-info </b>should be run to keep this file
           up-to-date if the repository is published for dumb transports.
           <i>git repack</i> does this by default.

       objects/info/alternates
           This file records paths to alternate object stores that this
           object store borrows objects from, one pathname per line. Note
           that not only native Git tools use it locally, but the HTTP
           fetcher also tries to use it remotely; this will usually work if
           you have relative paths (relative to the object database, not to
           the repository!) in your alternates file, but it will not work if
           you use absolute paths unless the absolute path in filesystem and
           web URL is the same. See also <i>objects/info/http-alternates</i>.

       objects/info/http-alternates
           This file records URLs to alternate object stores that this
           object store borrows objects from, to be used when the repository
           is fetched over HTTP.

       refs
           References are stored in subdirectories of this directory. The
           <i>git prune</i> command knows to preserve objects reachable from refs
           found in this directory and its subdirectories. This directory is
           ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/refs" will
           be used instead.

       refs/heads/<b>name</b>
           records tip-of-the-tree commit objects of branch <b>name</b>

       refs/tags/<b>name</b>
           records any object name (not necessarily a commit object, or a
           tag object that points at a commit object).

       refs/remotes/<b>name</b>
           records tip-of-the-tree commit objects of branches copied from a
           remote repository.

       refs/replace/<b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b>
           records the SHA-1 of the object that replaces <b>&lt;obj-sha1&gt;</b>. This is
           similar to info/grafts and is internally used and maintained by
           <a href="../man1/git-replace.1.html">git-replace(1)</a>. Such refs can be exchanged between repositories
           while grafts are not.

       packed-refs
           records the same information as refs/heads/, refs/tags/, and
           friends record in a more efficient way. See <a href="../man1/git-pack-refs.1.html">git-pack-refs(1)</a>.
           This file is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and
           "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/packed-refs" will be used instead.

       HEAD
           A symref (see glossary) to the <b>refs/heads/ </b>namespace describing
           the currently active branch. It does not mean much if the
           repository is not associated with any working tree (i.e. a <i>bare</i>
           repository), but a valid Git repository <b>must </b>have the HEAD file;
           some porcelains may use it to guess the designated "default"
           branch of the repository (usually <i>master</i>). It is legal if the
           named branch <i>name</i> does not (yet) exist. In some legacy setups, it
           is a symbolic link instead of a symref that points at the current
           branch.

           HEAD can also record a specific commit directly, instead of being
           a symref to point at the current branch. Such a state is often
           called <i>detached HEAD.</i>  See <a href="../man1/git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a> for details.

       config
           Repository specific configuration file. This file is ignored if
           $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config" will be used
           instead.

       branches
           A slightly deprecated way to store shorthands to be used to
           specify a URL to <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i> and <i>git push</i>. A file can be
           stored as <b>branches/&lt;name&gt; </b>and then <i>name</i> can be given to these
           commands in place of <i>repository</i> argument. See the REMOTES section
           in <a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> for details. This mechanism is legacy and not
           likely to be found in modern repositories. This directory is
           ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/branches"
           will be used instead.

       hooks
           Hooks are customization scripts used by various Git commands. A
           handful of sample hooks are installed when <i>git init</i> is run, but
           all of them are disabled by default. To enable, the <b>.sample</b>
           suffix has to be removed from the filename by renaming. Read
           <a href="githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a> for more details about each hook. This directory is
           ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/hooks"
           will be used instead.

       index
           The current index file for the repository. It is usually not
           found in a bare repository.

       sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;
           The shared index part, to be referenced by $GIT_DIR/index and
           other temporary index files. Only valid in split index mode.

       info
           Additional information about the repository is recorded in this
           directory. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set
           and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info" will be used instead.

       info/refs
           This file helps dumb transports discover what refs are available
           in this repository. If the repository is published for dumb
           transports, this file should be regenerated by <i>git</i>
           <i>update-server-info</i> every time a tag or branch is created or
           modified. This is normally done from the <b>hooks/update </b>hook, which
           is run by the <i>git-receive-pack</i> command when you <i>git push</i> into the
           repository.

       info/grafts
           This file records fake commit ancestry information, to pretend
           the set of parents a commit has is different from how the commit
           was actually created. One record per line describes a commit and
           its fake parents by listing their 40-byte hexadecimal object
           names separated by a space and terminated by a newline.

           Note that the grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to
           problems transferring objects between repositories; see
           <a href="../man1/git-replace.1.html">git-replace(1)</a> for a more flexible and robust system to do the
           same thing.

       info/exclude
           This file, by convention among Porcelains, stores the exclude
           pattern list.  <b>.gitignore </b>is the per-directory ignore file.  <i>git</i>
           <i>status</i>, <i>git add</i>, <i>git rm</i> and <i>git clean</i> look at it but the core Git
           commands do not look at it. See also: <a href="gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>.

       info/sparse-checkout
           This file stores sparse checkout patterns. See also:
           <a href="../man1/git-read-tree.1.html">git-read-tree(1)</a>.

       remotes
           Stores shorthands for URL and default refnames for use when
           interacting with remote repositories via <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i> and
           <i>git push</i> commands. See the REMOTES section in <a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> for
           details. This mechanism is legacy and not likely to be found in
           modern repositories. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
           is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/remotes" will be used instead.

       logs
           Records of changes made to refs are stored in this directory. See
           <a href="../man1/git-update-ref.1.html">git-update-ref(1)</a> for more information. This directory is ignored
           if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/logs" will be used
           instead.

       logs/refs/heads/<b>name</b>
           Records all changes made to the branch tip named <b>name</b>.

       logs/refs/tags/<b>name</b>
           Records all changes made to the tag named <b>name</b>.

       shallow
           This is similar to <b>info/grafts </b>but is internally used and
           maintained by shallow clone mechanism. See <b>--depth </b>option to
           <a href="../man1/git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>. This file is ignored if
           $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/shallow" will be used
           instead.

       commondir
           If this file exists, $GIT_COMMON_DIR (see <a href="../man1/git.1.html">git(1)</a>) will be set to
           the path specified in this file if it is not explicitly set. If
           the specified path is relative, it is relative to $GIT_DIR. The
           repository with commondir is incomplete without the repository
           pointed by "commondir".

       modules
           Contains the git-repositories of the submodules.

       worktrees
           Contains administrative data for linked working trees. Each
           subdirectory contains the working tree-related part of a linked
           working tree. This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR is
           set, in which case "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees" will be used
           instead.

       worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/gitdir
           A text file containing the absolute path back to the .git file
           that points to here. This is used to check if the linked
           repository has been manually removed and there is no need to keep
           this directory any more. The mtime of this file should be updated
           every time the linked repository is accessed.

       worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/locked
           If this file exists, the linked working tree may be on a portable
           device and not available. The presence of this file prevents
           <b>worktrees/&lt;id&gt; </b>from being pruned either automatically or manually
           by <b>git worktree prune</b>. The file may contain a string explaining
           why the repository is locked.

       worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/link
           If this file exists, it is a hard link to the linked .git file.
           It is used to detect if the linked repository is manually
           removed.
