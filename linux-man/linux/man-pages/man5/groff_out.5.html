</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This manual page describes the <i>intermediate output</i> format of the GNU
       <a href="../man7/roff.7.html">roff(7)</a> text processing system <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>.  This output is produced by
       a run of the GNU <a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff(1)</a> program.  It contains already all device-
       specific information, but it is not yet fed into a device
       postprocessor program.

       As the GNU <i>roff</i> processor <a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> is a wrapper program around <b>troff</b>
       that automatically calls a postprocessor, this output does not show
       up normally.  This is why it is called <i>intermediate</i> within the <i>groff</i>
       <i>system</i>.  The <b>groff </b>program provides the option <b>-Z </b>to inhibit
       postprocessing, such that the produced <i>intermediate output</i> is sent to
       standard output just like calling <b>troff </b>manually.

       In this document, the term <i>troff output</i> describes what is output by
       the GNU <b>troff </b>program, while <i>intermediate output</i> refers to the
       language that is accepted by the parser that prepares this output for
       the postprocessors.  This parser is smarter on whitespace and
       implements obsolete elements for compatibility, otherwise both
       formats are the same.  Both formats can be viewed directly with
       <b>gxditview</b>(1).

       The main purpose of the <i>intermediate output</i> concept is to facilitate
       the development of postprocessors by providing a common programming
       interface for all devices.  It has a language of its own that is
       completely different from the <a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> language.  While the <i>groff</i>
       language is a high-level programming language for text processing,
       the <i>intermediate output</i> language is a kind of low-level assembler
       language by specifying all positions on the page for writing and
       drawing.

       The pre-<i>groff roff</i> versions are denoted as <i>classical troff</i>.  The
       <i>intermediate output</i> produced by <b>groff </b>is fairly readable, while
       <i>classical troff</i> output was hard to understand because of strange
       habits that are still supported, but not used any longer by <i>GNU</i>
       <i>troff</i>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="LANGUAGE_CONCEPTS" href="#LANGUAGE_CONCEPTS"></a>LANGUAGE CONCEPTS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       During the run of <b>troff</b>, the <i>roff</i> input is cracked down to the
       information on what has to be printed at what position on the
       intended device.  So the language of the <i>intermediate output</i> format
       can be quite small.  Its only elements are commands with or without
       arguments.  In this document, the term “command” always refers to the
       <i>intermediate output</i> language, never to the <i>roff</i> language used for
       document formatting.  There are commands for positioning and text
       writing, for drawing, and for device controlling.

   <b>Separation</b>
       <i>Classical troff output</i> had strange requirements on whitespace.  The
       <b>groff </b>output parser, however, is smart about whitespace by making it
       maximally optional.  The whitespace characters, i.e., the <i>tab</i>, <i>space</i>,
       and <i>newline</i> characters, always have a syntactical meaning.  They are
       never printable because spacing within the output is always done by
       positioning commands.

       Any sequence of <i>space</i> or <i>tab</i> characters is treated as a single
       <i>syntactical space</i>.  It separates commands and arguments, but is only
       required when there would occur a clashing between the command code
       and the arguments without the space.  Most often, this happens when
       variable length command names, arguments, argument lists, or command
       clusters meet.  Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length
       need not be separated by <i>syntactical space</i>.

       A line break is a syntactical element, too.  Every command argument
       can be followed by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character.
       Thus a <i>syntactical line break</i> is defined to consist of optional
       <i>syntactical space</i> that is optionally followed by a comment, and a
       newline character.

       The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a
       single letter taking a fixed number of arguments.  For historical
       reasons, the parser allows to stack such commands on the same line,
       but fortunately, in <i>groff intermediate output</i>, every command with at
       least one argument is followed by a line break, thus providing
       excellent readability.

       The other commands — those for drawing and device controlling — have
       a more complicated structure; some recognize long command names, and
       some take a variable number of arguments.  So all <b>D </b>and <b>x </b>commands
       were designed to request a <i>syntactical line break</i> after their last
       argument.  Only one command, ‘<b>x X</b>’ has an argument that can stretch
       over several lines, all other commands must have all of their
       arguments on the same line as the command, i.e., the arguments may
       not be split by a line break.

       Empty lines, i.e., lines containing only space and/or a comment, can
       occur everywhere.  They are just ignored.

   <b>Argument Units</b>
       Some commands take integer arguments that are assumed to represent
       values in a measurement unit, but the letter for the corresponding
       <i>scale indicator</i> is not written with the output command arguments; see
       <a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> and the <i>groff info file</i> for more on this topic.  Most
       commands assume the scale indicator <b>u</b>, the basic unit of the device,
       some use <b>z</b>, the <i>scaled point unit</i> of the device, while others, such
       as the color commands expect plain integers.  Note that these scale
       indicators are relative to the chosen device.  They are defined by
       the parameters specified in the device's <i>DESC</i> file; see
       <a href="groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>.

       Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the
       names of fonts and special characters (this is, glyphs).  The names
       of glyphs and fonts can be of arbitrary length.  A glyph that is to
       be printed will always be in the current font.

       A string argument is always terminated by the next whitespace
       character (space, tab, or newline); an embedded <b># </b>character is
       regarded as part of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment
       command.  An integer argument is already terminated by the next non-
       digit character, which then is regarded as the first character of the
       next argument or command.

   <b>Document Parts</b>
       A correct <i>intermediate output</i> document consists of two parts, the
       <i>prologue</i> and the <i>body</i>.

       The task of the <i>prologue</i> is to set the general device parameters
       using three exactly specified commands.  The <i>groff prologue</i> is
       guaranteed to consist of the following three lines (in that order):

              <b>x T </b><i>device</i>
              <b>x res </b><i>n h v</i>
              <b>x init</b>

       with the arguments set as outlined in the section <b>Device Control</b>
       <b>Commands</b>.  However, the parser for the <i>intermediate output</i> format is
       able to swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.

       The <i>body</i> is the main section for processing the document data.
       Syntactically, it is a sequence of any commands different from the
       ones used in the <i>prologue</i>.  Processing is terminated as soon as the
       first <b>x stop </b>command is encountered; the last line of any <i>groff</i>
       <i>intermediate output</i> always contains such a command.

       Semantically, the <i>body</i> is page oriented.  A new page is started by a
       <b>p </b>command.  Positioning, writing, and drawing commands are always
       done within the current page, so they cannot occur before the first
       <b>p </b>command.  Absolute positioning (by the <b>H </b>and <b>V </b>commands) is done
       relative to the current page, all other positioning is done relative
       to the current location within this page.

<h2><a id="COMMAND_REFERENCE" href="#COMMAND_REFERENCE"></a>COMMAND REFERENCE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This section describes all <i>intermediate output</i> commands, the
       classical commands as well as the <i>groff</i> extensions.

   <b>Comment Command</b>
       <b>#</b><i>anything</i><b>⟨end-of-line⟩</b>
              A comment.  Ignore any characters from the <b># </b>character up to
              the next newline character.

       This command is the only possibility for commenting in the
       <i>intermediate output</i>.  Each comment can be preceded by arbitrary
       <i>syntactical space</i>; every command can be terminated by a comment.

   <b>Simple Commands</b>
       The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a
       single character, taking a fixed number of arguments.  Most of them
       are commands for positioning and text writing.  These commands are
       smart about whitespace.  Optionally, <i>syntactical space</i> can be
       inserted before, after, and between the command letter and its
       arguments.  All of these commands are stackable, i.e., they can be
       preceded by other simple commands or followed by arbitrary other
       commands on the same line.  A separating <i>syntactical space</i> is only
       necessary when two integer arguments would clash or if the preceding
       argument ends with a string argument.

       <b>C </b><i>xxx</i>⟨white-space⟩
              Print a glyph (special character) named <i>xxx</i>.  The trailing
              <i>syntactical space</i> or <i>line break</i> is necessary to allow glyph
              names of arbitrary length.  The glyph is printed at the
              current print position; the glyph's size is read from the font
              file.  The print position is not changed.

       <b>c </b><i>c</i>    Print glyph with single-letter name <i>c</i> at the current print
              position; the glyph's size is read from the font file.  The
              print position is not changed.

       <b>f </b><i>n</i>    Set font to font number <i>n</i> (a non-negative integer).

       <b>H </b><i>n</i>    Move right to the absolute vertical position <i>n</i> (a non-negative
              integer in basic units <b>u</b>) relative to left edge of current
              page.

       <b>h </b><i>n</i>    Move <i>n</i> (a non-negative integer) basic units <b>u </b>horizontally to
              the right.  <i>[CSTR #54]</i> allows negative values for <i>n</i> also, but
              <i>groff</i> doesn't use this.

       <b>m </b><i>color-scheme</i> [<i>component ...</i>]
              Set the color for text (glyphs), line drawing, and the outline
              of graphic objects using different color schemes; the
              analogous command for the filling color of graphic objects is
              <b>DF</b>.  The color components are specified as integer arguments
              between 0 and 65536.  The number of color components and their
              meaning vary for the different color schemes.  These commands
              are generated by the <i>groff</i> escape sequence <b>\m</b>.  No position
              changing.  These commands are a <i>groff</i> extension.

              <b>mc </b><i>cyan magenta yellow</i>
                     Set color using the CMY color scheme, having the
                     3 color components cyan, magenta, and yellow.

              <b>md     </b>Set color to the default color value (black in most
                     cases).  No component arguments.

              <b>mg </b><i>gray</i>
                     Set color to the shade of gray given by the argument,
                     an integer between 0 (black) and 65536 (white).

              <b>mk </b><i>cyan magenta yellow black</i>
                     Set color using the CMYK color scheme, having the
                     4 color components cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

              <b>mr </b><i>red green blue</i>
                     Set color using the RGB color scheme, having the
                     3 color components red, green, and blue.

       <b>N </b><i>n</i>    Print glyph with index <i>n</i> (an integer, normally non-negative)
              of the current font.  The print position is not changed.  If
              <b>-T html </b>or <b>-T xhtml </b>is used, negative values are emitted also
              to indicate an unbreakable space with given width.  For
              example, <b>N -193 </b>represents an unbreakable space which has a
              width of 193u.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>n </b><i>b a</i>  Inform the device about a line break, but no positioning is
              done by this command.  In <i>classical troff</i>, the integer
              arguments <i>b</i> and <i>a</i> informed about the space before and after
              the current line to make the <i>intermediate output</i> more human
              readable without performing any action.  In <i>groff</i>, they are
              just ignored, but they must be provided for compatibility
              reasons.

       <b>p </b><i>n</i>    Begin a new page in the outprint.  The page number is set
              to <i>n</i>.  This page is completely independent of pages formerly
              processed even if those have the same page number.  The
              vertical position on the outprint is automatically set to 0.
              All positioning, writing, and drawing is always done relative
              to a page, so a <b>p </b>command must be issued before any of these
              commands.

       <b>s </b><i>n</i>    Set point size to <i>n</i> scaled points (this is unit <b>z </b>in GNU
              <b>troff</b>).  <i>Classical troff</i> used the unit <i>points</i> (<b>p</b>) instead; see
              section <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>.

       <b>t </b><i>xyz...</i>⟨white-space⟩
       <b>t </b><i>xyz... dummy-arg</i>⟨white-space⟩
              Print a word, i.e., a sequence of glyphs with single-letter
              names <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, etc., terminated by a space character or a line
              break; an optional second integer argument is ignored (this
              allows the formatter to generate an even number of arguments).
              The first glyph should be printed at the current position, the
              current horizontal position should then be increased by the
              width of the first glyph, and so on for each glyph.  The
              widths of the glyph are read from the font file, scaled for
              the current point size, and rounded to a multiple of the
              horizontal resolution.  Special characters (glyphs with names
              longer than a single letter) cannot be printed using this
              command; use the <b>C </b>command for those glyphs.  This command is
              a <i>groff</i> extension; it is only used for devices whose <i>DESC</i> file
              contains the <b>tcommand </b>keyword; see <a href="groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>.

       <b>u </b><i>n xyz...</i>⟨white-space⟩
              Print word with track kerning.  This is the same as the <b>t</b>
              command except that after printing each glyph, the current
              horizontal position is increased by the sum of the width of
              that glyph and <i>n</i> (an integer in basic units <b>u</b>).  This command
              is a <i>groff</i> extension; it is only used for devices whose <i>DESC</i>
              file contains the <b>tcommand </b>keyword; see <a href="groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>.

       <b>V </b><i>n</i>    Move down to the absolute vertical position <i>n</i> (a non-negative
              integer in basic units <b>u</b>) relative to upper edge of current
              page.

       <b>v </b><i>n</i>    Move <i>n</i> basic units <b>u </b>down (<i>n</i> is a non-negative integer).
              <i>[CSTR #54]</i> allows negative values for <i>n</i> also, but <i>groff</i>
              doesn't use this.

       <b>w      </b>Informs about a paddable whitespace to increase readability.
              The spacing itself must be performed explicitly by a move
              command.

   <b>Graphics Commands</b>
       Each graphics or drawing command in the <i>intermediate output</i> starts
       with the letter <b>D </b>followed by one or two characters that specify a
       subcommand; this is followed by a fixed or variable number of integer
       arguments that are separated by a single space character.  A
       <b>D </b>command may not be followed by another command on the same line
       (apart from a comment), so each <b>D </b>command is terminated by a
       <i>syntactical line break</i>.

       <b>troff </b>output follows the classical spacing rules (no space between
       command and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single space
       character), but the parser allows optional space between the command
       letters and makes the space before the first argument optional.  As
       usual, each space can be any sequence of tab and space characters.

       Some graphics commands can take a variable number of arguments.  In
       this case, they are integers representing a size measured in basic
       units <b>u</b>.  The <i>h</i> arguments stand for horizontal distances where
       positive means right, negative left.  The <i>v</i> arguments stand for
       vertical distances where positive means down, negative up.  All these
       distances are offsets relative to the current location.

       Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly
       corresponds to a similar <i>groff</i> <b>\D </b>escape sequence; see <a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a>.

       Unknown <b>D </b>commands are assumed to be device-specific.  Its arguments
       are parsed as strings; the whole information is then sent to the
       postprocessor.

       In the following command reference, the syntax element <i>⟨line-break⟩</i>
       means a <i>syntactical line break</i> as defined in section <b>Separation</b>.

       <b>D~ </b><i>h1 v1 h2 v2</i> ... <i>hn vn</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw B-spline from current position to offset (<i>h1</i>, <i>v1</i>), then
              to offset (<i>h2</i>, <i>v2</i>) if given, etc., up to (<i>hn</i>, <i>vn</i>). This
              command takes a variable number of argument pairs; the current
              position is moved to the terminal point of the drawn curve.

       <b>Da </b><i>h1 v1 h2 v2</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw arc from current position to (<i>h1</i>, <i>v1</i>)+(<i>h2</i>, <i>v2</i>) with
              center at (<i>h1</i>, <i>v1</i>); then move the current position to the
              final point of the arc.

       <b>DC </b><i>d</i>⟨line-break⟩
       <b>DC </b><i>d dummy-arg</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw a solid circle using the current fill color with
              diameter <i>d</i> (integer in basic units <b>u</b>) with leftmost point at
              the current position; then move the current position to the
              rightmost point of the circle.  An optional second integer
              argument is ignored (this allows to the formatter to generate
              an even number of arguments).  This command is a <i>groff</i>
              extension.

       <b>Dc </b><i>d</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw circle line with diameter <i>d</i> (integer in basic units <b>u</b>)
              with leftmost point at the current position; then move the
              current position to the rightmost point of the circle.

       <b>DE </b><i>h v</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw a solid ellipse in the current fill color with a
              horizontal diameter of <i>h</i> and a vertical diameter of <i>v</i> (both
              integers in basic units <b>u</b>) with the leftmost point at the
              current position; then move to the rightmost point of the
              ellipse.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>De </b><i>h v</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw an outlined ellipse with a horizontal diameter of <i>h</i> and a
              vertical diameter of <i>v</i> (both integers in basic units <b>u</b>) with
              the leftmost point at current position; then move to the
              rightmost point of the ellipse.

       <b>DF </b><i>color-scheme</i> [<i>component ...</i>]⟨line-break⟩
              Set fill color for solid drawing objects using different color
              schemes; the analogous command for setting the color of text,
              line graphics, and the outline of graphic objects is <b>m</b>.  The
              color components are specified as integer arguments between 0
              and 65536.  The number of color components and their meaning
              vary for the different color schemes.  These commands are
              generated by the <i>groff</i> escape sequences <b>\D'F </b>...<b>'  </b>and <b>\M</b>
              (with no other corresponding graphics commands).  No position
              changing.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

              <b>DFc </b><i>cyan magenta yellow</i>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the CMY
                     color scheme, having the 3 color components cyan,
                     magenta, and yellow.

              <b>DFd </b>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects to the default
                     fill color value (black in most cases).  No component
                     arguments.

              <b>DFg </b><i>gray</i>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects to the shade
                     of gray given by the argument, an integer between 0
                     (black) and 65536 (white).

              <b>DFk </b><i>cyan magenta yellow black</i>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the CMYK
                     color scheme, having the 4 color components cyan,
                     magenta, yellow, and black.

              <b>DFr </b><i>red green blue</i>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the RGB
                     color scheme, having the 3 color components red, green,
                     and blue.

       <b>Df </b><i>n</i>⟨line-break⟩
              The argument <i>n</i> must be an integer in the range -32767 to
              32767.

              0≤<i>n</i>≤1000
                     Set the color for filling solid drawing objects to a
                     shade of gray, where 0 corresponds to solid white, 1000
                     (the default) to solid black, and values in between to
                     intermediate shades of gray; this is obsoleted by
                     command <b>DFg</b>.

              <i>n</i>&lt;0 or <i>n</i>&gt;1000
                     Set the filling color to the color that is currently
                     being used for the text and the outline, see command <b>m</b>.
                     For example, the command sequence

                            mg 0 0 65536
                            Df -1

                     sets all colors to blue.

              No position changing.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>Dl </b><i>h v</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw line from current position to offset (<i>h</i>, <i>v</i>) (integers in
              basic units <b>u</b>); then set current position to the end of the
              drawn line.

       <b>Dp </b><i>h1 v1 h2 v2</i> ... <i>hn vn</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw a polygon line from current position to offset (<i>h1</i>, <i>v1</i>),
              from there to offset (<i>h2</i>, <i>v2</i>), etc., up to offset (<i>hn</i>, <i>vn</i>),
              and from there back to the starting position.  For historical
              reasons, the position is changed by adding the sum of all
              arguments with odd index to the actual horizontal position and
              the even ones to the vertical position.  Although this doesn't
              make sense it is kept for compatibility.  This command is a
              <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>DP </b><i>h1 v1 h2 v2</i> ... <i>hn vn</i>⟨line-break⟩
              The same macro as the corresponding <b>Dp </b>command with the same
              arguments, but draws a solid polygon in the current fill color
              rather than an outlined polygon.  The position is changed in
              the same way as with <b>Dp</b>.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>Dt </b><i>n</i>⟨line-break⟩
              Set the current line thickness to <i>n</i> (an integer in basic
              units <b>u</b>) if <i>n</i>&gt;0; if <i>n</i>=0 select the smallest available line
              thickness; if <i>n</i>&lt;0 set the line thickness proportional to the
              point size (this is the default before the first <b>Dt </b>command
              was specified).  For historical reasons, the horizontal posi‐
              tion is changed by adding the argument to the actual horizon‐
              tal position, while the vertical position is not changed.
              Although this doesn't make sense it is kept for compatibility.
              This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

   <b>Device Control Commands</b>
       Each device control command starts with the letter <b>x </b>followed by a
       space character (optional or arbitrary space/tab in <i>groff</i>) and a sub‐
       command letter or word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a
       <i>syntactical space</i>.  All <b>x </b>commands are terminated by a <i>syntactical</i>
       <i>line break</i>; no device control command can be followed by another com‐
       mand on the same line (except a comment).

       The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase read‐
       ability, it can be written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of
       characters terminated by the next tab, space, or newline character.
       All characters of the subcommand word but the first are simply
       ignored.  For example, <b>troff </b>outputs the initialization command <b>x i</b>
       as <b>x init </b>and the resolution command <b>x r </b>as <b>x res</b>.  But writings like
       <b>x i_like_groff </b>and <b>x roff_is_groff </b>are accepted as well to mean the
       same commands.

       In the following, the syntax element <i>⟨line-break⟩</i> means a <i>syntactical</i>
       <i>line break</i> as defined in section <b>Separation</b>.

       <b>xF </b><i>name</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>Filename</i> control command)
              Use <i>name</i> as the intended name for the current file in error
              reports.  This is useful for remembering the original file
              name when <b>groff </b>uses an internal piping mechanism.  The input
              file is not changed by this command.  This command is a <i>groff</i>
              extension.

       <b>xf </b><i>n s</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>font</i> control command)
              Mount font position <i>n</i> (a non-negative integer) with font
              named <i>s</i> (a text word), cf.  <a href="groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>.

       <b>xH </b><i>n</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>Height</i> control command)
              Set character height to <i>n</i> (a positive integer in scaled
              points <b>z</b>).  <i>Classical troff</i> used the unit points (<b>p</b>) instead;
              see section <b>COMPATIBILITY</b>.

       <b>xi </b>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>init</i> control command)
              Initialize device.  This is the third command of the <i>prologue</i>.

       <b>xp </b>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>pause</i> control command)
              Parsed but ignored.  The classical documentation reads <i>pause</i>
              <i>device, can be restarted</i>.

       <b>xr </b><i>n h v</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>resolution</i> control command)
              Resolution is <i>n</i>, while <i>h</i> is the minimal horizontal motion, and
              <i>v</i> the minimal vertical motion possible with this device; all
              arguments are positive integers in basic units <b>u </b>per inch.
              This is the second command of the <i>prologue</i>.

       <b>xS </b><i>n</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>Slant</i> control command)
              Set slant to <i>n</i> degrees (an integer in basic units <b>u</b>).

       <b>xs </b>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>stop</i> control command)
              Terminates the processing of the current file; issued as the
              last command of any <i>intermediate troff output</i>.

       <b>xt </b>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>trailer</i> control command)
              Generate trailer information, if any.  In <b>groff</b>, this is actu‐
              ally just ignored.

       <b>xT </b><i>xxx</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>Typesetter</i> control command)
              Set name of device to word <i>xxx</i>, a sequence of characters ended
              by the next whitespace character.  The possible device names
              coincide with those from the groff <b>-T </b>option.  This is the
              first command of the <i>prologue</i>.

       <b>xu </b><i>n</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>underline</i> control command)
              Configure underlining of spaces.  If <i>n</i> is 1, start underlining
              of spaces; if <i>n</i> is 0, stop underlining of spaces.  This is
              needed for the <b>cu </b>request in <b>nroff </b>mode and is ignored other‐
              wise.  This command is a <i>groff</i> extension.

       <b>xX </b><i>anything</i>⟨line-break⟩
              (<i>X-escape</i> control command)
              Send string <i>anything</i> uninterpreted to the device.  If the line
              following this command starts with a <b>+ </b>character this line is
              interpreted as a continuation line in the following sense.
              The <b>+ </b>is ignored, but a newline character is sent instead to
              the device, the rest of the line is sent uninterpreted.  The
              same applies to all following lines until the first character
              of a line is not a <b>+ </b>character.  This command is generated by
              the <i>groff</i> escape sequence <b>\X</b>.  The line-continuing feature is
              a <i>groff</i> extension.

   <b>Obsolete Command</b>
       In <i>classical troff</i> output, emitting a single glyph was mostly done by
       a very strange command that combined a horizontal move and the print‐
       ing of a glyph.  It didn't have a command code, but is represented by
       a 3-character argument consisting of exactly 2 digits and a charac‐
       ter.

       <i>ddc</i>    Move right <i>dd</i> (exactly two decimal digits) basic units <b>u</b>, then
              print glyph with single-letter name <i>c</i>.

              In <i>groff</i>, arbitrary <i>syntactical space</i> around and within this
              command is allowed to be added.  Only when a preceding command
              on the same line ends with an argument of variable length a
              separating space is obligatory.  In <i>classical troff</i>, large
              clusters of these and other commands were used, mostly without
              spaces; this made such output almost unreadable.

       For modern high-resolution devices, this command does not make sense
       because the width of the glyphs can become much larger than two deci‐
       mal digits.  In <b>groff</b>, this is only used for the devices <b>X75</b>, <b>X75-12</b>,
       <b>X100</b>, and <b>X100-12</b>.  For other devices, the commands <b>t </b>and <b>u </b>provide a
       better functionality.

       The <i>roff</i> postprocessors are programs that have the task to translate
       the <i>intermediate output</i> into actions that are sent to a device.  A
       device can be some piece of hardware such as a printer, or a software
       file format suitable for graphical or text processing.  The <i>groff</i>
       system provides powerful means that make the programming of such
       postprocessors an easy task.

       There is a library function that parses the <i>intermediate output</i> and
       sends the information obtained to the device via methods of a class
       with a common interface for each device.  So a <i>groff</i> postprocessor
       must only redefine the methods of this class.  For details, see the
       reference in section <b>FILES</b>.

       · Low-resolution device <i>latin1</i>

         This is similar to the high-resolution device except that the posi‐
         tioning is done at a minor scale.  Some comments (lines starting
         with <i>#</i>) were added for clarification; they were not generated by
         the formatter.

       · Classical style output

         As a computer monitor has a very low resolution compared to modern
         printers the <i>intermediate output</i> for the X devices can use the
         jump-and-write command with its 2-digit displacements.

         <b>shell&gt; </b>"hell world" | groff -Z -T X100

       This output can be fed into the postprocessor <b>xditview</b>(1x) or
       <b>gxditview</b>(1) for displaying in X.

       Due to the obsolete jump-and-write command, the text clusters in the
       classical output are almost unreadable.

<h2><a id="COMPATIBILITY" href="#COMPATIBILITY"></a>COMPATIBILITY  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <i>intermediate output</i> language of the <i>classical troff</i> was first
       documented in <i>[CSTR #97]</i>.  The <i>groff intermediate output</i> format is
       compatible with this specification except for the following features.

       · The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.

       · The old hardware was very different from what we use today.  So the
         <i>groff</i> devices are also fundamentally different from the ones in
         <i>classical troff</i>.  For example, the classical PostScript device was
         called <i>post</i> and had a resolution of 720 units per inch, while
         <i>groff</i>'s <i>ps</i> device has a resolution of 72000 units per inch.  Maybe,
         by implementing some rescaling mechanism similar to the classical
         quasi device independence, these could be integrated into modern
         <i>groff</i>.

       · The B-spline command <b>D~ </b>is correctly handled by the <i>intermediate</i>
         <i>output</i> parser, but the drawing routines aren't implemented in some
         of the postprocessor programs.

       · The argument of the commands <b>s </b>and <b>x H </b>has the implicit unit scaled
         point <b>z </b>in <i>groff</i>, while <i>classical troff</i> had point (<b>p</b>).  This isn't
         an incompatibility, but a compatible extension, for both units
         coincide for all devices without a <i>sizescale</i> parameter, including
         all classical and the <i>groff</i> text devices.  The few <i>groff</i> devices
         with a sizescale parameter either did not exist, had a different
         name, or seem to have had a different resolution.  So conflicts
         with classical devices are very unlikely.

       · The position changing after the commands <b>Dp</b>, <b>DP</b>, and <b>Dt </b>is
         illogical, but as old versions of groff used this feature it is
         kept for compatibility reasons.

       The differences between <i>groff</i> and <i>classical troff</i> are documented in
       <a href="../man7/groff_diff.7.html">groff_diff(7)</a>.
