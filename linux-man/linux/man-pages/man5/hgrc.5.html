</pre>
<h2><a id="SYNOPSIS" href="#SYNOPSIS"></a>SYNOPSIS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
       aspects of its behavior.

       The configuration files use a simple ini-file format. A configuration
       file consists of sections, led by a <b>[section] </b>header and followed by
       <b>name = value </b>entries:

       [ui]
       username = Firstname Lastname &lt;firstname.lastname@example.net&gt;
       verbose = True

       The above entries will be referred to as <b>ui.username </b>and <b>ui.verbose</b>,
       respectively. See the Syntax section below.
</pre>
<h2><a id="FILES" href="#FILES"></a>FILES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
       These files do not exist by default and you will have to create the
       appropriate configuration files yourself: global configuration like
       the username setting is typically put into
       <b>%USERPROFILE%\mercurial.ini </b>or <b>$HOME/.hgrc </b>and local configuration is
       put into the per-repository <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc </b>file.

       The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is
       installed. <b>*.rc </b>files from a single directory are read in
       alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones. Where
       multiple paths are given below, settings from earlier paths override
       later ones.

       (All) <b>&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc</b>

          Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
          particular repository. This file is not version-controlled, and
          will not get transferred during a "clone" operation. Options in
          this file override options in all other configuration files. On
          Plan 9 and Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn't
          belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group. See the
          documentation for the <b>[trusted] </b>section below for more details.

       (Plan 9) <b>$home/lib/hgrc</b>
       (Unix) <b>$HOME/.hgrc</b>
       (Windows) <b>%USERPROFILE%\.hgrc</b>
       (Windows) <b>%USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini</b>
       (Windows) <b>%HOME%\.hgrc</b>
       (Windows) <b>%HOME%\Mercurial.ini</b>

          Per-user configuration file(s), for the user running Mercurial. On
          Windows 9x, <b>%HOME% </b>is replaced by <b>%APPDATA%</b>. Options in these
          files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by this user in any
          directory. Options in these files override per-system and
          per-installation options.

       (Plan 9) <b>/lib/mercurial/hgrc</b>
       (Plan 9) <b>/lib/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</b>
       (Unix) <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>
       (Unix) <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</b>

          Per-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial
          is running. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands
          executed by any user in any directory. Options in these files
          override per-installation options.

       (Plan 9) <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/lib/mercurial/hgrc</b>
       (Plan 9) <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/lib/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</b>
       (Unix) <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>
       (Unix) <b>&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</b>

          Per-installation configuration files, searched for in the
          directory where Mercurial is installed. <b>&lt;install-root&gt; </b>is the
          parent directory of the <b>hg </b>executable (or symlink) being run. For
          example, if installed in <b>/shared/tools/bin/hg</b>, Mercurial will look
          in <b>/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>. Options in these files apply
          to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.

       (Windows) <b>&lt;install-dir&gt;\Mercurial.ini or</b>
       (Windows) <b>&lt;install-dir&gt;\hgrc.d\*.rc or</b>
       (Windows) <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mercurial</b>

          Per-installation/system configuration files, for the system on
          which Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
          Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory. Registry
          keys contain PATH-like strings, every part of which must reference
          a <b>Mercurial.ini </b>file or be a directory where <b>*.rc </b>files will be
          read.  Mercurial checks each of these locations in the specified
          order until one or more configuration files are detected.

       Note   The registry key
              <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Mercurial </b>is used when
              running 32-bit Python on 64-bit Windows.
</pre>
<h2><a id="SYNTAX" href="#SYNTAX"></a>SYNTAX  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       A configuration file consists of sections, led by a <b>[section] </b>header
       and followed by <b>name = value </b>entries (sometimes called <b>configuration</b>
       <b>keys</b>):

       [spam]
       eggs=ham
       green=
          eggs

       Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow are indented,
       they are treated as continuations of that entry. Leading whitespace
       is removed from values. Empty lines are skipped. Lines beginning with
       <b># </b>or <b>; </b>are ignored and may be used to provide comments.

       Configuration keys can be set multiple times, in which case Mercurial
       will use the value that was configured last. As an example:

       [spam]
       eggs=large
       ham=serrano
       eggs=small

       This would set the configuration key named <b>eggs </b>to <b>small</b>.

       It is also possible to define a section multiple times. A section can
       be redefined on the same and/or on different configuration files. For
       example:

       [foo]
       eggs=large
       ham=serrano
       eggs=small

       [bar]
       eggs=ham
       green=
          eggs

       [foo]
       ham=prosciutto
       eggs=medium
       bread=toasted

       This would set the <b>eggs</b>, <b>ham</b>, and <b>bread </b>configuration keys of the <b>foo</b>
       section to <b>medium</b>, <b>prosciutto</b>, and <b>toasted</b>, respectively. As you can
       see there only thing that matters is the last value that was set for
       each of the configuration keys.

       If a configuration key is set multiple times in different
       configuration files the final value will depend on the order in which
       the different configuration files are read, with settings from
       earlier paths overriding later ones as described on the <b>Files </b>section
       above.

       A line of the form <b>%include file </b>will include <b>file </b>into the current
       configuration file. The inclusion is recursive, which means that
       included files can include other files. Filenames are relative to the
       configuration file in which the <b>%include </b>directive is found.
       Environment variables and <b>~user </b>constructs are expanded in <b>file</b>. This
       lets you do something like:

       %include ~/.hgrc.d/$HOST.rc

       to include a different configuration file on each computer you use.

       A line with <b>%unset name </b>will remove <b>name </b>from the current section, if
       it has been set previously.

       The values are either free-form text strings, lists of text strings,
       or Boolean values. Boolean values can be set to true using any of
       "1", "yes", "true", or "on" and to false using "0", "no", "false", or
       "off" (all case insensitive).

       List values are separated by whitespace or comma, except when values
       are placed in double quotation marks:

       allow_read = "John Doe, PhD", brian, betty

       Quotation marks can be escaped by prefixing them with a backslash.
       Only quotation marks at the beginning of a word is counted as a
       quotation (e.g., <b>foo"bar baz </b>is the list of <b>foo"bar </b>and <b>baz</b>).

<h2><a id="SECTIONS" href="#SECTIONS"></a>SECTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
       Mercurial configuration file, the purpose of each section, its
       possible keys, and their possible values.

   <b>alias</b>
       Defines command aliases.  Aliases allow you to define your own
       commands in terms of other commands (or aliases), optionally
       including arguments. Positional arguments in the form of <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, etc
       in the alias definition are expanded by Mercurial before execution.
       Positional arguments not already used by <b>$N </b>in the definition are put
       at the end of the command to be executed.

       Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:

       &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument&gt;]...

       For example, this definition:

       latest = log --limit 5

       creates a new command <b>latest </b>that shows only the five most recent
       changesets. You can define subsequent aliases using earlier ones:

       stable5 = latest -b stable

       Note   It is possible to create aliases with the same names as
              existing commands, which will then override the original
              definitions. This is almost always a bad idea!

       An alias can start with an exclamation point (<b>!</b>) to make it a shell
       alias. A shell alias is executed with the shell and will let you run
       arbitrary commands. As an example,

       echo = !echo $@

       will let you do <b>hg echo foo </b>to have <b>foo </b>printed in your terminal. A
       better example might be:

       purge = !$HG status --no-status --unknown -0 | xargs -0 rm

       which will make <b>hg purge </b>delete all unknown files in the repository
       in the same manner as the purge extension.

       Positional arguments like <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, etc. in the alias definition expand
       to the command arguments. Unmatched arguments are removed. <b>$0 </b>expands
       to the alias name and <b>$@ </b>expands to all arguments separated by a
       space. These expansions happen before the command is passed to the
       shell.

       Shell aliases are executed in an environment where <b>$HG </b>expands to the
       path of the Mercurial that was used to execute the alias. This is
       useful when you want to call further Mercurial commands in a shell
       alias, as was done above for the purge alias. In addition, <b>$HG_ARGS</b>
       expands to the arguments given to Mercurial. In the <b>hg echo foo </b>call
       above, <b>$HG_ARGS </b>would expand to <b>echo foo</b>.

       Note   Some global configuration options such as <b>-R </b>are processed
              before shell aliases and will thus not be passed to aliases.

   <b>annotate</b>
       Settings used when displaying file annotations. All values are
       Booleans and default to False. See <b>diff </b>section for related options
       for the diff command.

       <b>ignorews</b>

              Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>ignorewsamount</b>

              Ignore changes in the amount of white space.

       <b>ignoreblanklines</b>

              Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

   <b>auth</b>
       Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication. This section
       allows you to store usernames and passwords for use when logging <i>into</i>
       HTTP servers. See the <b>[web] </b>configuration section if you want to
       configure <i>who</i> can login to your HTTP server.

       Each line has the following format:

       &lt;name&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;

       where <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>is used to group arguments into authentication entries.
       Example:

       foo.prefix = hg.intevation.org/mercurial
       foo.username = foo
       foo.password = bar
       foo.schemes = http https

       bar.prefix = secure.example.org
       bar.key = path/to/file.key
       bar.cert = path/to/file.cert
       bar.schemes = https

       Supported arguments:

       <b>prefix</b>

              Either <b>* </b>or a URI prefix with or without the scheme part.  The
              authentication entry with the longest matching prefix is used
              (where <b>* </b>matches everything and counts as a match of length
              1). If the prefix doesn't include a scheme, the match is
              performed against the URI with its scheme stripped as well,
              and the schemes argument, q.v., is then subsequently
              consulted.

       <b>username</b>

              Optional. Username to authenticate with. If not given, and the
              remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user
              will be prompted for it. Environment variables are expanded in
              the username letting you do <b>foo.username = $USER</b>. If the URI
              includes a username, only <b>[auth] </b>entries with a matching
              username or without a username will be considered.

       <b>password</b>

              Optional. Password to authenticate with. If not given, and the
              remote site requires basic or digest authentication, the user
              will be prompted for it.

       <b>key</b>

              Optional. PEM encoded client certificate key file. Environment
              variables are expanded in the filename.

       <b>cert</b>

              Optional. PEM encoded client certificate chain file.
              Environment variables are expanded in the filename.

       <b>schemes</b>

              Optional. Space separated list of URI schemes to use this
              authentication entry with. Only used if the prefix doesn't
              include a scheme. Supported schemes are http and https. They
              will match static-http and static-https respectively, as well.
              Default: https.

       If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user is prompted
       for credentials as usual if required by the remote.

   <b>decode/encode</b>
       Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
       typically be used for newline processing or other
       localization/canonicalization of files.

       Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
       Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository root.
       For example, to match any file ending in <b>.txt </b>in the root directory
       only, use the pattern <b>*.txt</b>. To match any file ending in <b>.c </b>anywhere
       in the repository, use the pattern <b>**.c</b>.  For each file only the
       first matching filter applies.

       The filter command can start with a specifier, either <b>pipe: </b>or
       <b>tempfile:</b>. If no specifier is given, <b>pipe: </b>is used by default.

       A <b>pipe: </b>command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed
       data on stdout.

       Pipe example:

       [encode]
       # uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
       # note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
       *.gz = pipe: gunzip

       [decode]
       # recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
       # can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
       *.gz = gzip

       A <b>tempfile: </b>command is a template. The string <b>INFILE </b>is replaced with
       the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be filtered by
       the command. The string <b>OUTFILE </b>is replaced with the name of an empty
       temporary file, where the filtered data must be written by the
       command.

       Note   The tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
              where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
              strange effects and may corrupt the contents of your files.

       This filter mechanism is used internally by the <b>eol </b>extension to
       translate line ending characters between Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF)
       format. We suggest you use the <b>eol </b>extension for convenience.

   <b>defaults</b>
       (defaults are deprecated. Don't use them. Use aliases instead)

       Use the <b>[defaults] </b>section to define command defaults, i.e. the
       default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands.

       The following example makes <b>hg log </b>run in verbose mode, and <b>hg status</b>
       show only the modified files, by default:

       [defaults]
       log = -v
       status = -m

       The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when
       defining command defaults. The command defaults will also be applied
       to the aliases of the commands defined.

   <b>diff</b>
       Settings used when displaying diffs. Everything except for <b>unified </b>is
       a Boolean and defaults to False. See <b>annotate </b>section for related
       options for the annotate command.

       <b>git</b>

              Use git extended diff format.

       <b>nodates</b>

              Don't include dates in diff headers.

       <b>showfunc</b>

              Show which function each change is in.

       <b>ignorews</b>

              Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>ignorewsamount</b>

              Ignore changes in the amount of white space.

       <b>ignoreblanklines</b>

              Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

       <b>unified</b>

              Number of lines of context to show.

   <b>email</b>
       Settings for extensions that send email messages.

       <b>from</b>

              Optional. Email address to use in "From" header and SMTP
              envelope of outgoing messages.

       <b>to</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of recipients' email addresses.

       <b>cc</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of carbon copy recipients'
              email addresses.

       <b>bcc</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of blind carbon copy
              recipients' email addresses.

       <b>method</b>

              Optional. Method to use to send email messages. If value is
              <b>smtp </b>(default), use SMTP (see the <b>[smtp] </b>section for
              configuration).  Otherwise, use as name of program to run that
              acts like sendmail (takes <b>-f </b>option for sender, list of
              recipients on command line, message on stdin). Normally,
              setting this to <b>sendmail </b>or <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail </b>is enough to
              use sendmail to send messages.

       <b>charsets</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of character sets considered
              convenient for recipients. Addresses, headers, and parts not
              containing patches of outgoing messages will be encoded in the
              first character set to which conversion from local encoding
              (<b>$HGENCODING</b>, <b>ui.fallbackencoding</b>) succeeds. If correct
              conversion fails, the text in question is sent as is. Defaults
              to empty (explicit) list.

              Order of outgoing email character sets:

              1. <b>us-ascii</b>: always first, regardless of settings

              2. <b>email.charsets</b>: in order given by user

              3. <b>ui.fallbackencoding</b>: if not in email.charsets

              4. <b>$HGENCODING</b>: if not in email.charsets

              5. <b>utf-8</b>: always last, regardless of settings

       Email example:

       [email]
       from = Joseph User &lt;joe.user@example.com&gt;
       method = /usr/sbin/sendmail
       # charsets for western Europeans
       # us-ascii, utf-8 omitted, as they are tried first and last
       charsets = iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252

   <b>extensions</b>
       Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features. To
       enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section.

       If you know that the extension is already in Python's search path,
       you can give the name of the module, followed by <b>=</b>, with nothing
       after the <b>=</b>.

       Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by <b>=</b>, followed by
       the path to the <b>.py </b>file (including the file name extension) that
       defines the extension.

       To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of
       broader scope, prepend its path with <b>!</b>, as in <b>foo = !/ext/path </b>or <b>foo</b>
       <b>= ! </b>when path is not supplied.

       Example for <b>~/.hgrc</b>:

       [extensions]
       # (the mq extension will get loaded from Mercurial's path)
       mq =
       # (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

   <b>format</b>
       <b>usestore</b>

              Enable or disable the "store" repository format which improves
              compatibility with systems that fold case or otherwise mangle
              filenames. Enabled by default. Disabling this option will
              allow you to store longer filenames in some situations at the
              expense of compatibility and ensures that the on-disk format
              of newly created repositories will be compatible with
              Mercurial before version 0.9.4.

       <b>usefncache</b>

              Enable or disable the "fncache" repository format which
              enhances the "store" repository format (which has to be
              enabled to use fncache) to allow longer filenames and avoids
              using Windows reserved names, e.g. "nul". Enabled by default.
              Disabling this option ensures that the on-disk format of newly
              created repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before
              version 1.1.

       <b>dotencode</b>

              Enable or disable the "dotencode" repository format which
              enhances the "fncache" repository format (which has to be
              enabled to use dotencode) to avoid issues with filenames
              starting with ._ on Mac OS X and spaces on Windows. Enabled by
              default. Disabling this option ensures that the on-disk format
              of newly created repositories will be compatible with
              Mercurial before version 1.7.

   <b>graph</b>
       Web graph view configuration. This section let you change graph
       elements display properties by branches, for instance to make the
       <b>default </b>branch stand out.

       Each line has the following format:

       &lt;branch&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;

       where <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>is the name of the branch being customized. Example:

       [graph]
       # 2px width
       default.width = 2
       # red color
       default.color = FF0000

       Supported arguments:

       <b>width</b>

              Set branch edges width in pixels.

       <b>color</b>

              Set branch edges color in hexadecimal RGB notation.

   <b>hooks</b>
       Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by
       various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple
       hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the
       action. Overriding a site-wide hook can be done by changing its value
       or setting it to an empty string.  Hooks can be prioritized by adding
       a prefix of <b>priority </b>to the hook name on a new line and setting the
       priority.  The default priority is 0 if not specified.

       Example <b>.hg/hgrc</b>:

       [hooks]
       # update working directory after adding changesets
       changegroup.update = hg update
       # do not use the site-wide hook
       incoming =
       incoming.email = /my/email/hook
       incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook
       # force autobuild hook to run before other incoming hooks
       priority.incoming.autobuild = 1

       Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give useful
       additional information. For each hook below, the environment
       variables it is passed are listed with names of the form <b>$HG_foo</b>.

       <b>changegroup</b>

              Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
              unbundle.  ID of the first new changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. URL
              from which changes came is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>commit</b>

              Run after a changeset has been created in the local
              repository. ID of the newly created changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>.
              Parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1 </b>and <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>incoming</b>

              Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or unbundled
              into the local repository. The ID of the newly arrived
              changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. URL that was source of changes came
              is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>outgoing</b>

              Run after sending changes from local repository to another. ID
              of first changeset sent is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. Source of operation is
              in <b>$HG_SOURCE</b>; see "preoutgoing" hook for description.

       <b>post-&lt;command&gt;</b>

              Run after successful invocations of the associated command.
              The contents of the command line are passed as <b>$HG_ARGS </b>and
              the result code in <b>$HG_RESULT</b>. Parsed command line arguments
              are passed as <b>$HG_PATS </b>and <b>$HG_OPTS</b>. These contain string
              representations of the python data internally passed to
              &lt;command&gt;. <b>$HG_OPTS </b>is a dictionary of options (with
              unspecified options set to their defaults).  <b>$HG_PATS </b>is a
              list of arguments. Hook failure is ignored.

       <b>pre-&lt;command&gt;</b>

              Run before executing the associated command. The contents of
              the command line are passed as <b>$HG_ARGS</b>. Parsed command line
              arguments are passed as <b>$HG_PATS </b>and <b>$HG_OPTS</b>. These contain
              string representations of the data internally passed to
              &lt;command&gt;. <b>$HG_OPTS </b>is a  dictionary of options (with
              unspecified options set to their defaults). <b>$HG_PATS </b>is a list
              of arguments. If the hook returns failure, the command doesn't
              execute and Mercurial returns the failure code.

       <b>prechangegroup</b>

              Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or unbundle.
              Exit status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed. Non-zero
              status will cause the push, pull or unbundle to fail. URL from
              which changes will come is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>precommit</b>

              Run before starting a local commit. Exit status 0 allows the
              commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the commit to
              fail.  Parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1 </b>and
              <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>prelistkeys</b>

              Run before listing pushkeys (like bookmarks) in the
              repository. Non-zero status will cause failure. The key
              namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>.

       <b>preoutgoing</b>

              Run before collecting changes to send from the local
              repository to another. Non-zero status will cause failure.
              This lets you prevent pull over HTTP or SSH. Also prevents
              against local pull, push (outbound) or bundle commands, but
              not effective, since you can just copy files instead then.
              Source of operation is in <b>$HG_SOURCE</b>. If "serve", operation is
              happening on behalf of remote SSH or HTTP repository. If
              "push", "pull" or "bundle", operation is happening on behalf
              of repository on same system.

       <b>prepushkey</b>

              Run before a pushkey (like a bookmark) is added to the
              repository. Non-zero status will cause the key to be rejected.
              The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>, the key is in <b>$HG_KEY</b>,
              the old value (if any) is in <b>$HG_OLD</b>, and the new value is in
              <b>$HG_NEW</b>.

       <b>pretag</b>

              Run before creating a tag. Exit status 0 allows the tag to be
              created. Non-zero status will cause the tag to fail. ID of
              changeset to tag is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. Name of tag is in <b>$HG_TAG</b>.
              Tag is local if <b>$HG_LOCAL=1</b>, in repository if <b>$HG_LOCAL=0</b>.

       <b>pretxnchangegroup</b>

              Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
              unbundle, but before the transaction has been committed.
              Changegroup is visible to hook program. This lets you validate
              incoming changes before accepting them. Passed the ID of the
              first new changeset in <b>$HG_NODE</b>. Exit status 0 allows the
              transaction to commit. Non-zero status will cause the
              transaction to be rolled back and the push, pull or unbundle
              will fail. URL that was source of changes is in <b>$HG_URL</b>.

       <b>pretxncommit</b>

              Run after a changeset has been created but the transaction not
              yet committed. Changeset is visible to hook program. This lets
              you validate commit message and changes. Exit status 0 allows
              the commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the
              transaction to be rolled back. ID of changeset is in <b>$HG_NODE</b>.
              Parent changeset IDs are in <b>$HG_PARENT1 </b>and <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>preupdate</b>

              Run before updating the working directory. Exit status 0
              allows the update to proceed. Non-zero status will prevent the
              update.  Changeset ID of first new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT1</b>.
              If merge, ID of second new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>.

       <b>listkeys</b>

              Run after listing pushkeys (like bookmarks) in the repository.
              The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>. <b>$HG_VALUES </b>is a
              dictionary containing the keys and values.

       <b>pushkey</b>

              Run after a pushkey (like a bookmark) is added to the
              repository. The key namespace is in <b>$HG_NAMESPACE</b>, the key is
              in <b>$HG_KEY</b>, the old value (if any) is in <b>$HG_OLD</b>, and the new
              value is in <b>$HG_NEW</b>.

       <b>tag</b>

              Run after a tag is created. ID of tagged changeset is in
              <b>$HG_NODE</b>.  Name of tag is in <b>$HG_TAG</b>. Tag is local if
              <b>$HG_LOCAL=1</b>, in repository if <b>$HG_LOCAL=0</b>.

       <b>update</b>

              Run after updating the working directory. Changeset ID of
              first new parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT1</b>. If merge, ID of second new
              parent is in <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>. If the update succeeded,
              <b>$HG_ERROR=0</b>. If the update failed (e.g. because conflicts not
              resolved), <b>$HG_ERROR=1</b>.

       Note   It is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the
              generic pre- and post- command hooks as they are guaranteed to
              be called in the appropriate contexts for influencing
              transactions.  Also, hooks like "commit" will be called in all
              contexts that generate a commit (e.g. tag) and not just the
              commit command.

       Note   Environment variables with empty values may not be passed to
              hooks on platforms such as Windows. As an example, <b>$HG_PARENT2</b>
              will have an empty value under Unix-like platforms for
              non-merge changesets, while it will not be available at all
              under Windows.

       The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:

       hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable
       hookname = python:/path/to/python/module.py:callable

       Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each hook is
       called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword
       <b>ui</b>), a repository object (keyword <b>repo</b>), and a <b>hooktype </b>keyword that
       tells what kind of hook is used. Arguments listed as environment
       variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no <b>HG_ </b>prefix,
       and names in lower case.

       If a Python hook returns a "true" value or raises an exception, this
       is treated as a failure.

   <b>hostfingerprints</b>
       Fingerprints of the certificates of known HTTPS servers.  A HTTPS
       connection to a server with a fingerprint configured here will only
       succeed if the servers certificate matches the fingerprint.  This is
       very similar to how ssh known hosts works.  The fingerprint is the
       SHA-1 hash value of the DER encoded certificate.  The CA chain and
       web.cacerts is not used for servers with a fingerprint.

       For example:

       [hostfingerprints]
       hg.intevation.org = 44:ed:af:1f:97:11:b6:01:7a:48:45:fc:10:3c:b7:f9:d4:89:2a:9d

       This feature is only supported when using Python 2.6 or later.

   <b>http_proxy</b>
       Used to access web-based Mercurial repositories through a HTTP proxy.

       <b>host</b>

              Host name and (optional) port of the proxy server, for example
              "myproxy:8000".

       <b>no</b>

              Optional. Comma-separated list of host names that should
              bypass the proxy.

       <b>passwd</b>

              Optional. Password to authenticate with at the proxy server.

       <b>user</b>

              Optional. User name to authenticate with at the proxy server.

       <b>always</b>

              Optional. Always use the proxy, even for localhost and any
              entries in <b>http_proxy.no</b>. True or False. Default: False.

   <b>merge-patterns</b>
       This section specifies merge tools to associate with particular file
       patterns. Tools matched here will take precedence over the default
       merge tool. Patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
       root.

       Example:

       [merge-patterns]
       **.c = kdiff3
       **.jpg = myimgmerge

   <b>merge-tools</b>
       This section configures external merge tools to use for file-level
       merges.

       Example <b>~/.hgrc</b>:

       [merge-tools]
       # Override stock tool location
       kdiff3.executable = ~/bin/kdiff3
       # Specify command line
       kdiff3.args = $base $local $other -o $output
       # Give higher priority
       kdiff3.priority = 1

       # Define new tool
       myHtmlTool.args = -m $local $other $base $output
       myHtmlTool.regkey = Software\FooSoftware\HtmlMerge
       myHtmlTool.priority = 1

       Supported arguments:

       <b>priority</b>

              The priority in which to evaluate this tool.  Default: 0.

       <b>executable</b>

              Either just the name of the executable or its pathname.  On
              Windows, the path can use environment variables with
              ${ProgramFiles} syntax.  Default: the tool name.

       <b>args</b>

              The arguments to pass to the tool executable. You can refer to
              the files being merged as well as the output file through
              these variables: <b>$base</b>, <b>$local</b>, <b>$other</b>, <b>$output</b>.  Default:
              <b>$local $base $other</b>

       <b>premerge</b>

              Attempt to run internal non-interactive 3-way merge tool
              before launching external tool.  Options are <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, or
              <b>keep </b>to leave markers in the file if the premerge fails.
              Default: True

       <b>binary</b>

              This tool can merge binary files. Defaults to False, unless
              tool was selected by file pattern match.

       <b>symlink</b>

              This tool can merge symlinks. Defaults to False, even if tool
              was selected by file pattern match.

       <b>check</b>

              A list of merge success-checking options:

              <b>changed</b>

                     Ask whether merge was successful when the merged file
                     shows no changes.

              <b>conflicts</b>

                     Check whether there are conflicts even though the tool
                     reported success.

              <b>prompt</b>

                     Always prompt for merge success, regardless of success
                     reported by tool.

       <b>fixeol</b>

              Attempt to fix up EOL changes caused by the merge tool.
              Default: False

       <b>gui</b>

              This tool requires a graphical interface to run. Default:
              False

       <b>regkey</b>

              Windows registry key which describes install location of this
              tool. Mercurial will search for this key first under
              <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER </b>and then under <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>.  Default:
              None

       <b>regkeyalt</b>

              An alternate Windows registry key to try if the first key is
              not found.  The alternate key uses the same <b>regname </b>and
              <b>regappend </b>semantics of the primary key.  The most common use
              for this key is to search for 32bit applications on 64bit
              operating systems.  Default: None

       <b>regname</b>

              Name of value to read from specified registry key. Defaults to
              the unnamed (default) value.

       <b>regappend</b>

              String to append to the value read from the registry,
              typically the executable name of the tool.  Default: None

   <b>patch</b>
       Settings used when applying patches, for instance through the
       'import' command or with Mercurial Queues extension.

       <b>eol</b>

              When set to 'strict' patch content and patched files end of
              lines are preserved. When set to <b>lf </b>or <b>crlf</b>, both files end of
              lines are ignored when patching and the result line endings
              are normalized to either LF (Unix) or CRLF (Windows). When set
              to <b>auto</b>, end of lines are again ignored while patching but
              line endings in patched files are normalized to their original
              setting on a per-file basis. If target file does not exist or
              has no end of line, patch line endings are preserved.
              Default: strict.

   <b>paths</b>
       Assigns symbolic names to repositories. The left side is the symbolic
       name, and the right gives the directory or URL that is the location
       of the repository. Default paths can be declared by setting the
       following entries.

       <b>default</b>

              Directory or URL to use when pulling if no source is
              specified.  Default is set to repository from which the
              current repository was cloned.

       <b>default-push</b>

              Optional. Directory or URL to use when pushing if no
              destination is specified.

       Custom paths can be defined by assigning the path to a name that
       later can be used from the command line. Example:

       [paths]
       my_path = <a href="http://example.com/path">http://example.com/path</a>

       To push to the path defined in <b>my_path </b>run the command:

       hg push my_path

   <b>phases</b>
       Specifies default handling of phases. See <b>hg help phases </b>for more
       information about working with phases.

       <b>publish</b>

              Controls draft phase behavior when working as a server. When
              true, pushed changesets are set to public in both client and
              server and pulled or cloned changesets are set to public in
              the client.  Default: True

       <b>new-commit</b>

              Phase of newly-created commits.  Default: draft

   <b>profiling</b>
       Specifies profiling type, format, and file output. Two profilers are
       supported: an instrumenting profiler (named <b>ls</b>), and a sampling
       profiler (named <b>stat</b>).

       In this section description, 'profiling data' stands for the raw data
       collected during profiling, while 'profiling report' stands for a
       statistical text report generated from the profiling data. The
       profiling is done using lsprof.

       <b>type</b>

              The type of profiler to use.  Default: ls.

              <b>ls</b>

                     Use Python's built-in instrumenting profiler. This
                     profiler works on all platforms, but each line number
                     it reports is the first line of a function. This
                     restriction makes it difficult to identify the
                     expensive parts of a non-trivial function.

              <b>stat</b>

                     Use a third-party statistical profiler, statprof. This
                     profiler currently runs only on Unix systems, and is
                     most useful for profiling commands that run for longer
                     than about 0.1 seconds.

       <b>format</b>

              Profiling format.  Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting profiler.
              Default: text.

              <b>text</b>

                     Generate a profiling report. When saving to a file, it
                     should be noted that only the report is saved, and the
                     profiling data is not kept.

              <b>kcachegrind</b>

                     Format profiling data for kcachegrind use: when saving
                     to a file, the generated file can directly be loaded
                     into kcachegrind.

       <b>frequency</b>

              Sampling frequency.  Specific to the <b>stat </b>sampling profiler.
              Default: 1000.

       <b>output</b>

              File path where profiling data or report should be saved. If
              the file exists, it is replaced. Default: None, data is
              printed on stderr

       <b>sort</b>

              Sort field.  Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting profiler.  One
              of <b>callcount</b>, <b>reccallcount</b>, <b>totaltime </b>and <b>inlinetime</b>.
              Default: inlinetime.

       <b>limit</b>

              Number of lines to show. Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting
              profiler.  Default: 30.

       <b>nested</b>

              Show at most this number of lines of drill-down info after
              each main entry.  This can help explain the difference between
              Total and Inline.  Specific to the <b>ls </b>instrumenting profiler.
              Default: 5.

   <b>revsetalias</b>
       Alias definitions for revsets. See <b>hg help revsets </b>for details.

   <b>server</b>
       Controls generic server settings.

       <b>uncompressed</b>

              Whether to allow clients to clone a repository using the
              uncompressed streaming protocol. This transfers about 40% more
              data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU on
              both server and client. Over a LAN (100 Mbps or better) or a
              very fast WAN, an uncompressed streaming clone is a lot faster
              (~10x) than a regular clone. Over most WAN connections
              (anything slower than about 6 Mbps), uncompressed streaming is
              slower, because of the extra data transfer overhead. This mode
              will also temporarily hold the write lock while determining
              what data to transfer.  Default is True.

       <b>preferuncompressed</b>

              When set, clients will try to use the uncompressed streaming
              protocol. Default is False.

       <b>validate</b>

              Whether to validate the completeness of pushed changesets by
              checking that all new file revisions specified in manifests
              are present. Default is False.

   <b>smtp</b>
       Configuration for extensions that need to send email messages.

       <b>host</b>

              Host name of mail server, e.g. "mail.example.com".

       <b>port</b>

              Optional. Port to connect to on mail server. Default: 465 (if
              <b>tls </b>is smtps) or 25 (otherwise).

       <b>tls</b>

              Optional. Method to enable TLS when connecting to mail server:
              starttls, smtps or none. Default: none.

       <b>verifycert</b>

              Optional. Verification for the certificate of mail server,
              when <b>tls </b>is starttls or smtps. "strict", "loose" or False. For
              "strict" or "loose", the certificate is verified as same as
              the verification for HTTPS connections (see <b>[hostfingerprints]</b>
              and <b>[web] cacerts </b>also). For "strict", sending email is also
              aborted, if there is no configuration for mail server in
              <b>[hostfingerprints] </b>and <b>[web] cacerts</b>.  --insecure for <b>hg email</b>
              overwrites this as "loose". Default: "strict".

       <b>username</b>

              Optional. User name for authenticating with the SMTP server.
              Default: none.

       <b>password</b>

              Optional. Password for authenticating with the SMTP server. If
              not specified, interactive sessions will prompt the user for a
              password; non-interactive sessions will fail. Default: none.

       <b>local_hostname</b>

              Optional. It's the hostname that the sender can use to
              identify itself to the MTA.

   <b>subpaths</b>
       Subrepository source URLs can go stale if a remote server changes
       name or becomes temporarily unavailable. This section lets you define
       rewrite rules of the form:

       &lt;pattern&gt; = &lt;replacement&gt;

       where <b>pattern </b>is a regular expression matching a subrepository source
       URL and <b>replacement </b>is the replacement string used to rewrite it.
       Groups can be matched in <b>pattern </b>and referenced in <b>replacements</b>. For
       instance:

       <a href="http://server/(.*)-hg/">http://server/(.*)-hg/</a> = <a href="http://hg.server//1/">http://hg.server/\1/</a>

       rewrites <b>http://server/foo-hg/ </b>into <b><a href="http://hg.server/foo/">http://hg.server/foo/</a> </b>.

       Relative subrepository paths are first made absolute, and the rewrite
       rules are then applied on the full (absolute) path. The rules are
       applied in definition order.

   <b>trusted</b>
       Mercurial will not use the settings in the <b>.hg/hgrc </b>file from a
       repository if it doesn't belong to a trusted user or to a trusted
       group, as various hgrc features allow arbitrary commands to be run.
       This issue is often encountered when configuring hooks or extensions
       for shared repositories or servers. However, the web interface will
       use some safe settings from the <b>[web] </b>section.

       This section specifies what users and groups are trusted. The current
       user is always trusted. To trust everybody, list a user or a group
       with name <b>*</b>. These settings must be placed in an <i>already-trusted file</i>
       to take effect, such as <b>$HOME/.hgrc </b>of the user or service running
       Mercurial.

       <b>users</b>

              Comma-separated list of trusted users.

       <b>groups</b>

              Comma-separated list of trusted groups.

   <b>ui</b>
       User interface controls.

       <b>archivemeta</b>

              Whether to include the .hg_archival.txt file containing meta
              data (hashes for the repository base and for tip) in archives
              created by the <b>hg archive </b>command or downloaded via hgweb.
              Default is True.

       <b>askusername</b>

              Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If True, and
              neither <b>$HGUSER </b>nor <b>$EMAIL </b>has been specified, then the user
              will be prompted to enter a username. If no username is
              entered, the default <b>USER@HOST </b>is used instead.  Default is
              False.

       <b>commitsubrepos</b>

              Whether to commit modified subrepositories when committing the
              parent repository. If False and one subrepository has
              uncommitted changes, abort the commit.  Default is False.

       <b>debug</b>

              Print debugging information. True or False. Default is False.

       <b>editor</b>

              The editor to use during a commit. Default is <b>$EDITOR </b>or <b>vi</b>.

       <b>fallbackencoding</b>

              Encoding to try if it's not possible to decode the changelog
              using UTF-8. Default is ISO-8859-1.

       <b>ignore</b>

              A file to read per-user ignore patterns from. This file should
              be in the same format as a repository-wide .hgignore file.
              This option supports hook syntax, so if you want to specify
              multiple ignore files, you can do so by setting something like
              <b>ignore.other = ~/.hgignore2</b>. For details of the ignore file
              format, see the <a href="hgignore.5.html">hgignore(5)</a> man page.

       <b>interactive</b>

              Allow to prompt the user. True or False. Default is True.

       <b>logtemplate</b>

              Template string for commands that print changesets.

       <b>merge</b>

              The conflict resolution program to use during a manual merge.
              For more information on merge tools see <b>hg help merge-tools</b>.
              For configuring merge tools see the <b>[merge-tools] </b>section.

       <b>portablefilenames</b>

              Check for portable filenames. Can be <b>warn</b>, <b>ignore </b>or <b>abort</b>.
              Default is <b>warn</b>.  If set to <b>warn </b>(or <b>true</b>), a warning message
              is printed on POSIX platforms, if a file with a non-portable
              filename is added (e.g. a file with a name that can't be
              created on Windows because it contains reserved parts like
              <b>AUX</b>, reserved characters like <b>:</b>, or would cause a case
              collision with an existing file).  If set to <b>ignore </b>(or
              <b>false</b>), no warning is printed.  If set to <b>abort</b>, the command
              is aborted.  On Windows, this configuration option is ignored
              and the command aborted.

       <b>quiet</b>

              Reduce the amount of output printed. True or False. Default is
              False.

       <b>remotecmd</b>

              remote command to use for clone/push/pull operations. Default
              is <b>hg</b>.

       <b>reportoldssl</b>

              Warn if an SSL certificate is unable to be due to using Python
              2.5 or earlier. True or False. Default is True.

       <b>report_untrusted</b>

              Warn if a <b>.hg/hgrc </b>file is ignored due to not being owned by a
              trusted user or group. True or False. Default is True.

       <b>slash</b>

              Display paths using a slash (<b>/</b>) as the path separator. This
              only makes a difference on systems where the default path
              separator is not the slash character (e.g. Windows uses the
              backslash character (<b>\</b>)).  Default is False.

       <b>ssh</b>

              command to use for SSH connections. Default is <b>ssh</b>.

       <b>strict</b>

              Require exact command names, instead of allowing unambiguous
              abbreviations. True or False. Default is False.

       <b>style</b>

              Name of style to use for command output.

       <b>timeout</b>

              The timeout used when a lock is held (in seconds), a negative
              value means no timeout. Default is 600.

       <b>traceback</b>

              Mercurial always prints a traceback when an unknown exception
              occurs. Setting this to True will make Mercurial print a
              traceback on all exceptions, even those recognized by
              Mercurial (such as IOError or MemoryError). Default is False.

       <b>username</b>

              The committer of a changeset created when running "commit".
              Typically a person's name and email address, e.g. <b>Fred Widget</b>
              <b>&lt;fred@example.com&gt;</b>. Default is <b>$EMAIL </b>or <b>username@hostname</b>. If
              the username in hgrc is empty, it has to be specified manually
              or in a different hgrc file (e.g. <b>$HOME/.hgrc</b>, if the admin
              set <b>username =  </b>in the system hgrc). Environment variables in
              the username are expanded.

       <b>verbose</b>

              Increase the amount of output printed. True or False. Default
              is False.

   <b>web</b>
       Web interface configuration. The settings in this section apply to
       both the builtin webserver (started by <b>hg serve</b>) and the script you
       run through a webserver (<b>hgweb.cgi </b>and the derivatives for FastCGI
       and WSGI).

       The Mercurial webserver does no authentication (it does not prompt
       for usernames and passwords to validate <i>who</i> users are), but it does
       do authorization (it grants or denies access for <i>authenticated users</i>
       based on settings in this section). You must either configure your
       webserver to do authentication for you, or disable the authorization
       checks.

       For a quick setup in a trusted environment, e.g., a private LAN,
       where you want it to accept pushes from anybody, you can use the
       following command line:

       $ hg --config web.allow_push=* --config web.push_ssl=False serve

       Note that this will allow anybody to push anything to the server and
       that this should not be used for public servers.

       The full set of options is:

       <b>accesslog</b>

              Where to output the access log. Default is stdout.

       <b>address</b>

              Interface address to bind to. Default is all.

       <b>allow_archive</b>

              List of archive format (bz2, gz, zip) allowed for downloading.
              Default is empty.

       <b>allowbz2</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of
              repository revisions.  Default is False.

       <b>allowgz</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of
              repository revisions.  Default is False.

       <b>allowpull</b>

              Whether to allow pulling from the repository. Default is True.

       <b>allow_push</b>

              Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or not
              set, push is not allowed. If the special value <b>*</b>, any remote
              user can push, including unauthenticated users. Otherwise, the
              remote user must have been authenticated, and the
              authenticated user name must be present in this list. The
              contents of the allow_push list are examined after the
              deny_push list.

       <b>allow_read</b>

              If the user has not already been denied repository access due
              to the contents of deny_read, this list determines whether to
              grant repository access to the user. If this list is not
              empty, and the user is unauthenticated or not present in the
              list, then access is denied for the user. If the list is empty
              or not set, then access is permitted to all users by default.
              Setting allow_read to the special value <b>* </b>is equivalent to it
              not being set (i.e. access is permitted to all users). The
              contents of the allow_read list are examined after the
              deny_read list.

       <b>allowzip</b>

              (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of repository
              revisions. Default is False. This feature creates temporary
              files.

       <b>archivesubrepos</b>

              Whether to recurse into subrepositories when archiving.
              Default is False.

       <b>baseurl</b>

              Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations, so
              third-party tools like email notification hooks can construct
              URLs. Example: <b><a href="http://hgserver/repos/">http://hgserver/repos/</a> </b>.

       <b>cacerts</b>

              Path to file containing a list of PEM encoded certificate
              authority certificates. Environment variables and <b>~user</b>
              constructs are expanded in the filename. If specified on the
              client, then it will verify the identity of remote HTTPS
              servers with these certificates.

              This feature is only supported when using Python 2.6 or later.
              If you wish to use it with earlier versions of Python, install
              the backported version of the ssl library that is available
              from <b><a href="http://pypi.python.org/">http://pypi.python.org</a> </b>.

              To disable SSL verification temporarily, specify <b>--insecure</b>
              from command line.

              You can use OpenSSL's CA certificate file if your platform has
              one. On most Linux systems this will be
              <b>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</b>. Otherwise you will have to
              generate this file manually. The form must be as follows:

              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----

       <b>cache</b>

              Whether to support caching in hgweb. Defaults to True.

       <b>collapse</b>

              With <b>descend </b>enabled, repositories in subdirectories are shown
              at a single level alongside repositories in the current path.
              With <b>collapse </b>also enabled, repositories residing at a deeper
              level than the current path are grouped behind navigable
              directory entries that lead to the locations of these
              repositories. In effect, this setting collapses each
              collection of repositories found within a subdirectory into a
              single entry for that subdirectory. Default is False.

       <b>comparisoncontext</b>

              Number of lines of context to show in side-by-side file
              comparison. If negative or the value <b>full</b>, whole files are
              shown. Default is 5.  This setting can be overridden by a
              <b>context </b>request parameter to the <b>comparison </b>command, taking
              the same values.

       <b>contact</b>

              Name or email address of the person in charge of the
              repository.  Defaults to ui.username or <b>$EMAIL </b>or "unknown" if
              unset or empty.

       <b>deny_push</b>

              Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or not
              set, push is not denied. If the special value <b>*</b>, all remote
              users are denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated users are
              all denied, and any authenticated user name present in this
              list is also denied. The contents of the deny_push list are
              examined before the allow_push list.

       <b>deny_read</b>

              Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository. If this
              list is not empty, unauthenticated users are all denied, and
              any authenticated user name present in this list is also
              denied access to the repository. If set to the special value
              <b>*</b>, all remote users are denied access (rarely needed ;). If
              deny_read is empty or not set, the determination of repository
              access depends on the presence and content of the allow_read
              list (see description). If both deny_read and allow_read are
              empty or not set, then access is permitted to all users by
              default. If the repository is being served via hgwebdir,
              denied users will not be able to see it in the list of
              repositories. The contents of the deny_read list have priority
              over (are examined before) the contents of the allow_read
              list.

       <b>descend</b>

              hgwebdir indexes will not descend into subdirectories. Only
              repositories directly in the current path will be shown (other
              repositories are still available from the index corresponding
              to their containing path).

       <b>description</b>

              Textual description of the repository's purpose or contents.
              Default is "unknown".

       <b>encoding</b>

              Character encoding name. Default is the current locale
              charset.  Example: "UTF-8"

       <b>errorlog</b>

              Where to output the error log. Default is stderr.

       <b>guessmime</b>

              Control MIME types for raw download of file content.  Set to
              True to let hgweb guess the content type from the file
              extension. This will serve HTML files as <b>text/html </b>and might
              allow cross-site scripting attacks when serving untrusted
              repositories. Default is False.

       <b>hidden</b>

              Whether to hide the repository in the hgwebdir index.  Default
              is False.

       <b>ipv6</b>

              Whether to use IPv6. Default is False.

       <b>logoimg</b>

              File name of the logo image that some templates display on
              each page.  The file name is relative to <b>staticurl</b>. That is,
              the full path to the logo image is "staticurl/logoimg".  If
              unset, <b>hglogo.png </b>will be used.

       <b>logourl</b>

              Base URL to use for logos. If unset,
              <b>http://mercurial.selenic.com/ </b>will be used.

       <b>maxchanges</b>

              Maximum number of changes to list on the changelog. Default is
              10.

       <b>maxfiles</b>

              Maximum number of files to list per changeset. Default is 10.

       <b>maxshortchanges</b>

              Maximum number of changes to list on the shortlog, graph or
              filelog pages. Default is 60.

       <b>name</b>

              Repository name to use in the web interface. Default is
              current working directory.

       <b>port</b>

              Port to listen on. Default is 8000.

       <b>prefix</b>

              Prefix path to serve from. Default is '' (server root).

       <b>push_ssl</b>

              Whether to require that inbound pushes be transported over SSL
              to prevent password sniffing. Default is True.

       <b>staticurl</b>

              Base URL to use for static files. If unset, static files (e.g.
              the hgicon.png favicon) will be served by the CGI script
              itself. Use this setting to serve them directly with the HTTP
              server.  Example: <b><a href="http://hgserver/static/">http://hgserver/static/</a> </b>.

       <b>stripes</b>

              How many lines a "zebra stripe" should span in multi-line
              output.  Default is 1; set to 0 to disable.

       <b>style</b>

              Which template map style to use.

       <b>templates</b>

              Where to find the HTML templates. Default is install path.

   <b>websub</b>
       Web substitution filter definition. You can use this section to
       define a set of regular expression substitution patterns which let
       you automatically modify the hgweb server output.

       The default hgweb templates only apply these substitution patterns on
       the revision description fields. You can apply them anywhere you want
       when you create your own templates by adding calls to the "websub"
       filter (usually after calling the "escape" filter).

       This can be used, for example, to convert issue references to links
       to your issue tracker, or to convert "markdown-like" syntax into HTML
       (see the examples below).

       Each entry in this section names a substitution filter.  The value of
       each entry defines the substitution expression itself.  The websub
       expressions follow the old interhg extension syntax, which in turn
       imitates the Unix sed replacement syntax:

       patternname = s/SEARCH_REGEX/REPLACE_EXPRESSION/[i]

       You can use any separator other than "/". The final "i" is optional
       and indicates that the search must be case insensitive.

       Examples:

       [websub]
       issues = s|issue(\d+)|&lt;a href="http://bts.example.org/issue\1"&gt;issue\1&lt;/a&gt;|i
       italic = s/\b_(\S+)_\b/&lt;i&gt;\1&lt;\/i&gt;/
       bold = s/\*\b(\S+)\b\*/&lt;b&gt;\1&lt;\/b&gt;/

   <b>worker</b>
       Parallel master/worker configuration. We currently perform working
       directory updates in parallel on Unix-like systems, which greatly
       helps performance.

       <b>numcpus</b>

              Number of CPUs to use for parallel operations. Default is 4 or
              the number of CPUs on the system, whichever is larger. A zero
              or negative value is treated as <b>use the default</b>.
