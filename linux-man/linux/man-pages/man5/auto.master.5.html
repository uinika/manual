       auto.master - Master Map for automounter
</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>auto.master </b>map is consulted to set up automount managed mount
       points when the <a href="../man8/autofs.8.html">autofs(8)</a> script is invoked or the <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a> pro‐
       gram is run. Each line describes a mount point and refers to an aut‐
       ofs map describing file systems to be mounted under the mount point.

       The default location of the master map is <b>@mapdir@/auto.master </b>but an
       alternate name may be given on the command line when running the au‐
       tomounter and the default master map may changed by setting the
       <b>MASTER_MAP_NAME </b>configuration variable in <b>@confdir@/autofs.  </b>If the
       master map name has no path then the system Name Service Switch con‐
       figuration will be consulted and each of the sources searched in line
       with the rules given in the Name Service Switch configuration.

       Access to mounts in maps is governed by a key.

       For direct maps the mount point is always specified as:

       <b>/-</b>

       and the key used within the direct map is the full path to the mount
       point. The direct map may have multiple entries in the master map.

       For indirect maps access is by using the path scheme:

       <b>/mount-point/key</b>

       where <i>mount-point</i> is one of the entries listed in the master map. The
       <i>key</i> is a single directory component and is matched against entries in
       the map given in the entry (See <a href="autofs.5.html">autofs(5)</a>).

       Additionally, a map may be included from its source as if it were it‐
       self present in the master map by including a line of the form:

       <b>+</b>[<b>maptype</b>[,<b>format</b>]:]<b>map </b>[<b>options</b>]

       and <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a> will process the map according to the specification
       described below for map entries. Indirect map entries must be unique
       in the master map so second and subsequent entries for an indirect
       mount point are ignored by <a href="../man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a>.
</pre>
<h2><a id="FORMAT" href="#FORMAT"></a>FORMAT  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       Master map entries have three fields separated by an arbitrary number
       of spaces or tabs. Lines beginning with # are comments. The first
       field is the mount point described above and the second field is the
       name of the map to be consulted for the mount point followed by the
       third field which contains options to be applied to all entries in
       the map.

       The format of a master map entry is:

       <b>mount-point </b>[<b>map-type</b>[,<b>format</b>]:]<b>map </b>[<b>options</b>]

       <b>mount-point</b>
              Base location for the <b>autofs </b>filesystem to be mounted.  For
              indirect maps this directory will be created (as with <b>mkdir</b>
              <b>-p</b>) and is removed when the <b>autofs </b>filesystem is umounted.

       <b>map-type</b>
              Type of map used for this mount point.  The following are
              valid map types:

              <b>file   </b>The map is a regular text file.

              <b>program</b>
                     The map is an executable program, which is passed a key
                     on the command line and returns an entry (everything
                     besides the key) on stdout if successful.  Optinally,
                     the keyword exec may be used as a synonym for program
                     to avoid confusion with amd formated maps mount type
                     program.

              <b>yp     </b>The map is a NIS (YP) database.

              <b>nisplus</b>
                     The map is a NIS+ database.

              <b>hesiod </b>The map is a hesiod database whose <b>filsys </b>entries are
                     used for maps.

              <b>ldap </b>or <b>ldaps</b>
                     The map is stored in an LDAP directory. If <b>ldaps </b>is
                     used the appropriate certificate must be configured in
                     the LDAP client.

              <b>multi  </b>This map type allows the specification of multiple maps
                     separated by "--". These maps are searched in order to
                     resolve key lookups.

              <b>dir    </b>This map type can be used at <b>+ </b>master map including
                     notation. The contents of files under given directory
                     are included to the master map. The name of file to be
                     included must be ended with ".autofs". A file will be
                     ignored if its name is not ended with the suffix. In
                     addition a dot file, a file which name is started with
                     "." is also ignored.

       <b>format</b>
              Format of the map data; currently the formats recognized are
              <b>sun</b>, which is a subset of the Sun automounter map format,
              <b>hesiod</b>, for hesiod filesys entries and <b>amd </b>for amd formated
              map entries.  If the format is left unspecified, it defaults
              to <b>sun </b>for all map types except <b>hesiod </b>unless it is a top
              level <b>amd </b>mount that has a configuration entry for the mount
              point path, in which case the format used is <b>amd</b>.

       <b>map</b>
              Name of the map to use.  This is an absolute UNIX pathname for
              maps of types <b>file</b>, <b>dir</b>, or <b>program</b>, and the name of a
              database in the case for maps of type <b>yp</b>, <b>nisplus</b>, or <b>hesiod</b>
              or the <b>dn </b>of an LDAP entry for maps of type <b>ldap</b>.

       <b>options</b>
              Any remaining command line arguments without leading dashes
              (-) are taken as options (<i>-o</i>) to <b>mount</b>.  Arguments with
              leading dashes are considered options for the maps and are
              passed to automount (8).

              The <b>sun </b>format supports the following options:

              <i>-Dvariable=value</i>
                     Replace <i>variable</i> with <i>value</i> in map substitutions.

              <i>-strict</i>
                     Treat errors when mounting file systems as fatal. This
                     is important when multiple file systems should be
                     mounted (`multimounts'). If this option is given, no
                     file system is mounted at all if at least one file
                     system can't be mounted.

              <i>[no]browse</i>
                     This is an autofs specific option that is a pseudo
                     mount option and so is given without a leading dash.
                     Use of the browse option pre-creates mount point
                     directories for indirect mount maps so the map keys can
                     be seen in a directory listing without being mounted.
                     Use of this option can cause performance problem if the
                     indirect map is large so it should be used with
                     caution. The internal program default is to enable
                     browse mode for indirect mounts but the default
                     installed configuration overrides this by setting
                     BROWSE_MODE to "no" because of the potential
                     performance problem.

              <i>nobind</i> This is an autofs specific option that is a pseudo
                     mount option and so is given without a leading dash. It
                     may be used either in the master map entry (so it
                     effects all the map entries) or with individual map
                     entries to prevent bind mounting of local NFS
                     filesystems. For direct mount maps the option is only
                     effective if specified on the first direct map entry
                     and is applied to all direct mount maps in the master
                     map. It is ignored if given on subsequent direct map
                     entries. It may be used on individual map entries of
                     both types. Bind mounting of NFS file systems can also
                     be prevented for specific map entrys by adding the
                     "port=" mount option to the entries.

              <i>symlink</i>
                     This option makes bind mounting use a symlink instead
                     of an actual bind mount. It is an autofs specific
                     option that is a pseudo mount option and so is given
                     without a leading dash. It may be used with indirect
                     map entries only, either in the master map (so it
                     effects all map entries) or with individual map
                     entries. The option is ignored for direct mounts and
                     non-root offest mount entries.

              <i>-r, --random-multimount-selection</i>
                     Enables the use of ramdom selection when choosing a
                     host from a list of replicated servers. This option is
                     applied to this mount only, overriding the global
                     setting that may be specified on the command line.

              <i>-w, --use-weight-only</i>
                     Use only specified weights for server selection where
                     more than one server is specified in the map entry. If
                     no server weights are given then each available server
                     will be tried in the order listed, within proximity.

              <i>-t, --timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
                     Set the expire timeout for map entries. This option can
                     be used to override the global default given either on
                     the command line or in the configuration.

              <i>-n, --negative-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</i>
                     Set the timeout for caching failed key lookups. This
                     option can be used to override the global default given
                     either on the command line or in the configuration.

              <i>--mode &lt;octal_mode&gt;</i>
                     Set the directory mode for the base location of the
                     <b>autofs </b>mount point.  If this option is given, <b>autofs</b>
                     will chmod that directory with this mode.
</pre>
<h2><a id="BUILTIN_MAP_-hosts" href="#BUILTIN_MAP_-hosts"></a>BUILTIN MAP -hosts  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If "-hosts" is given as the map then accessing a key under the mount
       point which corresponds to a hostname will allow access to the
       exports of that host. The hosts map cannot be dynamically updated and
       requires a HUP signal to be sent to the daemon for it to check hosts
       for an update. Due to possible hierarchic dependencies within a mount
       tree, it might not be completely updated during the HUP signal
       processing.

       For example, with an entry in the master map of <b>/net -hosts </b>accessing
       /net/myserver will mount exports from myserver on directories below
       /net/myserver.

       NOTE: mounts done from a hosts map will be mounted with the "no‐
       suid,nodev,intr" options unless overridden by explicily specifying
       the "suid", "dev" or "nointr" options in the master map entry.

<h2><a id="LDAP_MAPS" href="#LDAP_MAPS"></a>LDAP MAPS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       If the map type <b>ldap </b>is specified the mapname is of the form
       <b>[//servername/]dn</b>, where the optional <b>servername </b>is the name of the
       LDAP server to query, and <b>dn </b>is the Distinguished Name of a subtree
       to search for map entries.  The old style <b>ldap:servername:mapname </b>is
       also understood. Alternatively, the type can be obtained from the
       Name Service Switch configuration, in which case the map name alone
       must be given.

       If no schema is set in the autofs configuration then autofs will
       check each of the commonly used schema for a valid entry and if one
       is found it will used for subsequent lookups.

       There are three common schemas in use:

       <i>nisMap</i>
              Entries in the <b>nisMap </b>schema are <b>nisObject </b>objects in the
              specified subtree, where the <b>cn </b>attribute is the key (the
              wildcard key is "/"), and the <b>nisMapEntry </b>attribute contains
              the information used by the automounter.

       <i>automountMap</i>
              The <b>automountMap </b>schema has two variations that differ in the
              attribute used for the map key. Entries in the automountMap
              schema are <b>automount </b>objects in the specified subtree, where
              the <b>cn </b>or <b>automountKey </b>attribute (depending on local usage) is
              the key (the wildcard key is "/"), and the <b>automountInforma‐</b>
              <b>tion </b>attribute contains the information used by the auto‐
              mounter. Note that the <b>cn </b>attribute is case insensitive.

       The object classes and attributes used for accessing automount maps
       in LDAP can be changed by setting entries in the autofs configuration
       located in <b>@confdir@/autofs.conf</b>.

       <b>NOTE:  </b>If a schema is given in the configuration then all the schema
              configuration values must be set, any partial schema specifi‐
              cation will be ignored.

       For <b>amd </b>format maps a different schema is used:

       <i>amdMap</i>
              The <b>amdmap </b>schema contains attributes <b>amdmapName</b>, <b>amdmapKey</b>
              and <b>amdmapValue </b>where <b>amdmapName </b>contains the name of the con‐
              taining map, <b>amdmapKey </b>contains the map key and <b>amdmapValue</b>
              contains the map entry.

<h2><a id="LDAP_AUTHENTICATION,_ENCRYPTED_AND_CERTIFIED_CONNECTIONS" href="#LDAP_AUTHENTICATION,_ENCRYPTED_AND_CERTIFIED_CONNECTIONS"></a>LDAP AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTED AND CERTIFIED CONNECTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and certification
       may be used by setting appropriate values in the autofs
       authentication configuration file and configuring the LDAP client
       with appropriate settings.  The default location of this file is
       <b>@mapdir@/autofs_ldap_auth.conf</b>.

       If this file exists it will be used to establish whether TLS or au‐
       thentication should be used.

       An example of this file is:

         &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
         &lt;autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
                 usetls="yes"
                 tlsrequired="no"
                 authrequired="no"
                 authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
                 user="xyz"
                 secret="abc"
         /&gt;

       If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate Au‐
       thority certificate must be set within the LDAP client configuration
       in order to validate the server certificate. If, in addition, a cer‐
       tified connection is to be used then the client certificate and pri‐
       vate key file locations must also be configured within the LDAP
       client.

       In OpenLDAP these may be configured in the <b>ldap.conf </b>file or in the
       per-user configuration. For example it may be sensible to use the
       system wide configuration for the location of the Certificate Author‐
       ity certificate and set the location of the client certificate and
       private key in the per-user configuration. The location of these
       files and the configuration entry requirements is system dependent so
       the documentation for your installation will need to be consulted to
       get further information.

       See <a href="autofs_ldap_auth.conf.5.html">autofs_ldap_auth.conf(5)</a> for more information.
