       The <b>ppolicy </b>overlay is an implementation of the most recent IETF
       Password Policy proposal for LDAP.   When instantiated, it
       intercepts, decodes and applies specific password policy controls to
       overall use of a backend database, changes to user password fields,
       etc.

       The overlay provides a variety of password control mechanisms.  They
       include password aging -- both minimum and maximum ages, password
       reuse and duplication control, account time-outs, mandatory password
       resets, acceptable password content, and even grace logins.
       Different groups of users may be associated with different password
       policies, and there is no limit to the number of password policies
       that may be created.

       Note that some of the policies do not take effect when the operation
       is performed with the <b>rootdn </b>identity; all the operations, when
       performed with any other identity, may be subjected to constraints,
       like access control.  This overlay requires a rootdn to be configured
       on the database.

       Note that the IETF Password Policy proposal for LDAP makes sense when
       considering a single-valued password attribute, while the
       userPassword attribute allows multiple values.  This implementation
       enforces a single value for the userPassword attribute, despite its
       specification.
</pre>
<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION" href="#CONFIGURATION"></a>CONFIGURATION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf </b>configuration options apply to the ppolicy overlay.
       They should appear after the <b>overlay </b>directive.

       <b>ppolicy_default &lt;policyDN&gt;</b>
              Specify the DN of the pwdPolicy object to use when no specific
              policy is set on a given user's entry. If there is no specific
              policy for an entry and no default is given, then no policies
              will be enforced.

       <b>ppolicy_forward_updates</b>
              Specify that policy state changes that result from Bind
              operations (such as recording failures, lockout, etc.) on a
              consumer should be forwarded to a master instead of being
              written directly into the consumer's local database. This
              setting is only useful on a replication consumer, and also
              requires the <b>updateref </b>setting and <b>chain </b>overlay to be
              appropriately configured.

       <b>ppolicy_hash_cleartext</b>
              Specify that cleartext passwords present in Add and Modify
              requests should be hashed before being stored in the database.
              This violates the X.500/LDAP information model, but may be
              needed to compensate for LDAP clients that don't use the
              Password Modify extended operation to manage passwords.  It is
              recommended that when this option is used that compare,
              search, and read access be denied to all directory users.

       <b>ppolicy_use_lockout</b>
              A client will always receive an LDAP <b>InvalidCredentials</b>
              response when Binding to a locked account. By default, when a
              Password Policy control was provided on the Bind request, a
              Password Policy response will be included with no special
              error code set. This option changes the Password Policy
              response to include the <b>AccountLocked </b>error code. Note that
              sending the <b>AccountLocked </b>error code provides useful
              information to an attacker; sites that are sensitive to
              security issues should not enable this option.

<h2><a id="OBJECT_CLASS" href="#OBJECT_CLASS"></a>OBJECT CLASS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The <b>ppolicy </b>overlay depends on the <b>pwdPolicy </b>object class.  The
       definition of that class is as follows:

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.2.1
               NAME 'pwdPolicy'
               AUXILIARY
               SUP top
               MUST ( pwdAttribute )
               MAY (
                   pwdMinAge $ pwdMaxAge $ pwdInHistory $
                   pwdCheckQuality $ pwdMinLength $
                   pwdExpireWarning $ pwdGraceAuthnLimit $
                   pwdLockout $ pwdLockoutDuration $
                   pwdMaxFailure $ pwdFailureCountInterval $
                   pwdMustChange $ pwdAllowUserChange $
                   pwdSafeModify $ pwdMaxRecordedFailure ) )

       This implementation also provides an additional <b>pwdPolicyChecker</b>
       objectclass, used for password quality checking (see below).

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4754.2.99.1
               NAME 'pwdPolicyChecker'
               AUXILIARY
               SUP top
               MAY ( pwdCheckModule ) )

       Every account that should be subject to password policy control
       should have a <b>pwdPolicySubentry </b>attribute containing the DN of a
       valid <b>pwdPolicy </b>entry, or they can simply use the configured default.
       In this way different users may be managed according to different
       policies.

       Each one of the sections below details the meaning and use of a
       particular attribute of this <b>pwdPolicy </b>object class.

       <b>pwdAttribute</b>

       This attribute contains the name of the attribute to which the
       password policy is applied. For example, the password policy may be
       applied to the <b>userPassword </b>attribute.

       Note: in this implementation, the only value accepted for
       <b>pwdAttribute </b>is  <i>userPassword</i> .

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.1
              NAME 'pwdAttribute'

              SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 )

       <b>pwdMinAge</b>

       This attribute contains the number of seconds that must elapse
       between modifications allowed to the password. If this attribute is
       not present, zero seconds is assumed (i.e. the password may be
       modified whenever and however often is desired).

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.2
              NAME 'pwdMinAge'

              SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
              SINGLE-VALUE )

       <b>pwdMaxAge</b>

       This attribute contains the number of seconds after which a modified
       password will expire.  If this attribute is not present, or if its
       value is zero (0), then passwords will not expire.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.3
              NAME 'pwdMaxAge'

              SINGLE-VALUE )

       <b>pwdInHistory</b>

       This attribute is used to specify the maximum number of used
       passwords that will be stored in the <b>pwdHistory </b>attribute.  If the
       <b>pwdInHistory </b>attribute is not present, or if its value is zero (0),
       used passwords will not be stored in <b>pwdHistory </b>and thus any
       previously-used password may be reused.  No history checking occurs
       if the password is being modified by the <b>rootdn</b>, although the
       password is saved in the history.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.4
              NAME 'pwdInHistory'

              SINGLE-VALUE )

       <b>pwdCheckQuality</b>

       This attribute indicates if and how password syntax will be checked
       while a password is being modified or added. If this attribute is not
       present, or its value is zero (0), no syntax checking will be done.
       If its value is one (1), the server will check the syntax, and if the
       server is unable to check the syntax, whether due to a client-side
       hashed password or some other reason, it will be accepted. If its
       value is two (2), the server will check the syntax, and if the server
       is unable to check the syntax it will return an error refusing the
       password.

           (  1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.5

              SINGLE-VALUE )

       <b>pwdMinLength</b>

       When syntax checking is enabled (see also the <b>pwdCheckQuality</b>
       attribute), this attribute contains the minimum number of characters
       that will be accepted in a password. If this attribute is not
       present, minimum password length is not enforced. If the server is
       unable to check the length of the password, whether due to a client-
       side hashed password or some other reason, the server will, depending
       on the value of <b>pwdCheckQuality</b>, either accept the password without
       checking it (if <b>pwdCheckQuality </b>is zero (0) or one (1)) or refuse it
       (if <b>pwdCheckQuality </b>is two (2)).

              SINGLE-VALUE )

       <b>pwdExpireWarning</b>

       This attribute contains the maximum number of seconds before a
       password is due to expire that expiration warning messages will be
       returned to a user who is authenticating to the directory.  If this
       attribute is not present, or if the value is zero (0), no warnings
       will be sent.

       <b>pwdGraceAuthnLimit</b>

       This attribute contains the number of times that an expired password
       may be used to authenticate a user to the directory. If this
       attribute is not present or if its value is zero (0), users with
       expired passwords will not be allowed to authenticate to the
       directory.

       <b>pwdLockout</b>

       This attribute specifies the action that should be taken by the
       directory when a user has made a number of failed attempts to
       authenticate to the directory.  If <b>pwdLockout </b>is set (its value is
       "TRUE"), the user will not be allowed to attempt to authenticate to
       the directory after there have been a specified number of consecutive
       failed bind attempts.  The maximum number of consecutive failed bind
       attempts allowed is specified by the <b>pwdMaxFailure </b>attribute.  If
       <b>pwdLockout </b>is not present, or if its value is "FALSE", the password
       may be used to authenticate no matter how many consecutive failed
       bind attempts have been made.

       <b>pwdLockoutDuration</b>

       This attribute contains the number of seconds during which the
       password cannot be used to authenticate the user to the directory due
       to too many consecutive failed bind attempts.  (See also <b>pwdLockout</b>
       and <b>pwdMaxFailure</b>.)  If <b>pwdLockoutDuration </b>is not present, or if its
       value is zero (0), the password cannot be used to authenticate the
       user to the directory again until it is reset by an administrator.

       <b>pwdMaxFailure</b>

       This attribute contains the number of consecutive failed bind
       attempts after which the password may not be used to authenticate a
       user to the directory.  If <b>pwdMaxFailure </b>is not present, or its value
       is zero (0), then a user will be allowed to continue to attempt to
       authenticate to the directory, no matter how many consecutive failed
       bind attempts have occurred with that user's DN.  (See also
       <b>pwdLockout </b>and <b>pwdLockoutDuration</b>.)

       <b>pwdMaxRecordedFailure</b>

       This attribute contains the maximum number of failed bind attempts to
       store in a user's entry.  If <b>pwdMaxRecordedFailure </b>is not present, or
       its value is zero (0), then it defaults to the value of
       <b>pwdMaxFailure</b>.  If that value is also 0, the default is 5.

       This attribute contains the number of seconds after which old
       consecutive failed bind attempts are purged from the failure counter,
       even though no successful authentication has occurred.  If
       <b>pwdFailureCountInterval </b>is not present, or its value is zero (0), the
       failure counter will only be reset by a successful authentication.

       <b>pwdMustChange</b>

       This attribute specifies whether users must change their passwords
       when they first bind to the directory after a password is set or
       reset by the administrator, or not.  If <b>pwdMustChange </b>has a value of
       "TRUE", users must change their passwords when they first bind to the
       directory after a password is set or reset by the administrator.  If
       <b>pwdMustChange </b>is not present, or its value is "FALSE", users are not
       required to change their password upon binding after the
       administrator sets or resets the password.

       <b>pwdAllowUserChange</b>

       This attribute specifies whether users are allowed to change their
       own passwords or not.  If <b>pwdAllowUserChange </b>is set to "TRUE", or if
       the attribute is not present, users will be allowed to change their
       own passwords.  If its value is "FALSE", users will not be allowed to
       change their own passwords.

       Note: this implies that when <b>pwdAllowUserChange </b>is set to "TRUE",
       users will still be able to change the password of another user,
       subjected to access control.  This restriction only applies to
       modifications of ones's own password.  It should also be noted that
       <b>pwdAllowUserChange </b>was defined in the specification to provide rough
       access control to the password attribute in implementations that do
       not allow fine-grain access control.  Since OpenLDAP provides fine-
       grain access control, the use of this attribute is discouraged; ACLs
       should be used instead (see <a href="slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access(5)</a> for details).

       sent along with their new password when changing a password.  If
       <b>pwdSafeModify </b>is set to "TRUE", the existing password must be sent
       along with the new password.  If the attribute is not present, or its
       value is "FALSE", the existing password need not be sent along with
       the new password.

       <b>pwdCheckModule</b>

       This attribute names a user-defined loadable module that must
       instantiate the check_password() function.  This function will be
       called to further check a new password if <b>pwdCheckQuality </b>is set to
       one (1) or two (2), after all of the built-in password compliance
       checks have been passed.  This function will be called according to
       this function prototype:
           int <i>check_password</i> (char *pPasswd, char **ppErrStr, Entry
           *pEntry);
       The <b>pPasswd </b>parameter contains the clear-text user password, the
       <b>ppErrStr </b>parameter contains a double pointer that allows the function
       to return human-readable details about any error it encounters.  The
       optional <b>pEntry </b>parameter, if non-NULL, carries a pointer to the
       entry whose password is being checked.  If <b>ppErrStr </b>is NULL, then
       <i>funcName</i> must NOT attempt to use it/them.  A return value of
       LDAP_SUCCESS from the called function indicates that the password is
       ok, any other value indicates that the password is unacceptable.  If
       the password is unacceptable, the server will return an error to the
       client, and <b>ppErrStr </b>may be used to return a human-readable textual
       explanation of the error. The error string must be dynamically
       allocated as it will be free()'d by slapd.

<h2><a id="OPERATIONAL_ATTRIBUTES" href="#OPERATIONAL_ATTRIBUTES"></a>OPERATIONAL ATTRIBUTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The operational attributes used by the <b>ppolicy </b>module are stored in
       the user's entry.  Most of these attributes are not intended to be
       changed directly by users; they are there to track user activity.
       They have been detailed here so that administrators and users can
       both understand the workings of the <b>ppolicy </b>module.

       Note that the current IETF Password Policy proposal does not define
       how these operational attributes are expected to behave in a
       replication environment. In general, authentication attempts on a
       slave server only affect the copy of the operational attributes on
       that slave and will not affect any attributes for a user's entry on
       the master server. Operational attribute changes resulting from
       authentication attempts on a master server will usually replicate to
       the slaves (and also overwrite any changes that originated on the
       slave).  These behaviors are not guaranteed and are subject to change
       when a formal specification emerges.

       <b>userPassword</b>

       The <b>userPassword </b>attribute is not strictly part of the <b>ppolicy</b>
       module.  It is, however, the attribute that is tracked and controlled
       by the module.  Please refer to the standard OpenLDAP schema for its
       definition.

       <b>pwdPolicySubentry</b>

       This attribute refers directly to the <b>pwdPolicy </b>subentry that is to
       be used for this particular directory user.  If <b>pwdPolicySubentry</b>
       exists, it must contain the DN of a valid <b>pwdPolicy </b>object.  If it
       does not exist, the <b>ppolicy </b>module will enforce the default password
       policy rules on the user associated with this authenticating DN. If
       there is no default, or the referenced subentry does not exist, then
       no policy rules will be enforced.

       <b>pwdChangedTime</b>

       This attribute denotes the last time that the entry's password was
       changed.  This value is used by the password expiration policy to
       determine whether the password is too old to be allowed to be used
       for user authentication.  If <b>pwdChangedTime </b>does not exist, the
       user's password will not expire.

       This attribute contains the time that the user's account was locked.
       If the account has been locked, the password may no longer be used to
       authenticate the user to the directory.  If <b>pwdAccountLockedTime </b>is
       set to 000001010000Z, the user's account has been permanently locked
       and may only be unlocked by an administrator. Note that account
       locking only takes effect when the <b>pwdLockout </b>password policy
       attribute is set to "TRUE".

       <b>pwdFailureTime</b>

       This attribute contains the timestamps of each of the consecutive
       authentication failures made upon attempted authentication to this DN
       (i.e. account).  If too many timestamps accumulate here (refer to the
       <b>pwdMaxFailure </b>password policy attribute for details), and the
       <b>pwdLockout </b>password policy attribute is set to "TRUE", the account
       may be locked.  (Please also refer to the <b>pwdLockout </b>password policy
       attribute.)  Excess timestamps beyond those allowed by <b>pwdMaxFailure</b>
       or <b>pwdMaxRecordedFailure </b>may also be purged.  If a successful
       authentication is made to this DN (i.e. to this user account), then
       <b>pwdFailureTime </b>will be cleansed of entries.

       This attribute contains the history of previously used passwords for
       this DN (i.e. for this user account).  The values of this attribute
       are stored in string format as follows:

           pwdHistory=
               time "#" syntaxOID "#" length "#" data

           time=
               GeneralizedTime as specified in section 3.3.13 of [RFC4517]

           syntaxOID = numericoid
               This is the string representation of the dotted-decimal OID
               that defines the syntax used to store the password.
               numericoid is described in section 1.4 of [RFC4512].

           length = NumericString
               The number of octets in the data.  NumericString is described
               in section 3.3.23 of [RFC4517].

           data =
               Octets representing the password in the format specified by
               syntaxOID.

       This format allows the server to store and transmit a history of
       passwords that have been used.  In order for equality matching on the
       values in this attribute to function properly, the time field is in
       GMT format.

       DN for authentication to the directory.  If <b>pwdReset </b>is set to
       "TRUE", then the password was reset and the user must change it upon
       first authentication.  If the attribute does not exist, or is set to

       with significant input from Neil Dunbar and Kartik Subbarao of
       Hewlett-Packard.

       This manual page borrows heavily and shamelessly from the
