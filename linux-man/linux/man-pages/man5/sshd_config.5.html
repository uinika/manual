     sshd(8) reads configuration data from <i>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</i> (or the file
     specified with <b>-f </b>on the command line).  The file contains keyword-
     argument pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines
     are interpreted as comments.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in
     double quotes (") in order to represent arguments containing spaces.

     The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that key‐
     words are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):

     <b>AcceptEnv</b>
             Specifies what environment variables sent by the client will be
             copied into the session's environ(7).  See <b>SendEnv </b>in
             ssh_config(5) for how to configure the client.  The TERM envi‐
             ronment variable is always sent whenever the client requests a
             pseudo-terminal as it is required by the protocol.  Variables
             are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard charac‐
             ters ‘*’ and ‘?’.  Multiple environment variables may be sepa‐
             rated by whitespace or spread across multiple <b>AcceptEnv </b>direc‐
             tives.  Be warned that some environment variables could be used
             to bypass restricted user environments.  For this reason, care
             should be taken in the use of this directive.  The default is
             not to accept any environment variables.

     <b>AddressFamily</b>
             Specifies which address family should be used by sshd(8).
             Valid arguments are <b>any </b>(the default), <b>inet </b>(use IPv4 only), or
             <b>inet6 </b>(use IPv6 only).

     <b>AllowAgentForwarding</b>
             Specifies whether ssh-agent(1) forwarding is permitted.  The
             default is <b>yes</b>.  Note that disabling agent forwarding does not
             improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as
             they can always install their own forwarders.

     <b>AllowGroups</b>
             This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns,
             separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only for
             users whose primary group or supplementary group list matches
             one of the patterns.  Only group names are valid; a numerical
             group ID is not recognized.  By default, login is allowed for
             all groups.  The allow/deny directives are processed in the
             following order: <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>, <b>DenyGroups</b>, and finally
             <b>AllowGroups</b>.

             See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

     <b>AllowStreamLocalForwarding</b>
             Specifies whether StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding
             is permitted.  The available options are <b>yes </b>(the default) or
             <b>all </b>to allow StreamLocal forwarding, <b>no </b>to prevent all Stream‐
             Local forwarding, <b>local </b>to allow local (from the perspective of
             ssh(1)) forwarding only or <b>remote </b>to allow remote forwarding
             only.  Note that disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not
             improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as
             they can always install their own forwarders.

     <b>AllowTcpForwarding</b>
             Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.  The available
             options are <b>yes </b>(the default) or <b>all </b>to allow TCP forwarding,
             <b>no </b>to prevent all TCP forwarding, <b>local </b>to allow local (from
             the perspective of ssh(1)) forwarding only or <b>remote </b>to allow
             remote forwarding only.  Note that disabling TCP forwarding
             does not improve security unless users are also denied shell
             access, as they can always install their own forwarders.

     <b>AllowUsers</b>
             This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns,
             separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only for
             user names that match one of the patterns.  Only user names are
             valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.  By default,
             login is allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the form
             USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately checked, restrict‐
             ing logins to particular users from particular hosts.  HOST
             criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
             address/masklen format.  The allow/deny directives are pro‐
             cessed in the following order: <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>,
             <b>DenyGroups</b>, and finally <b>AllowGroups</b>.

             See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

     <b>AuthenticationMethods</b>
             Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully
             completed for a user to be granted access.  This option must be
             followed by one or more comma-separated lists of authentication
             method names, or by the single string <b>any </b>to indicate the
             default behaviour of accepting any single authentication
             method.  If the default is overridden, then successful authen‐
             tication requires completion of every method in at least one of
             these lists.

             For example, "publickey,password
             publickey,keyboard-interactive" would require the user to com‐
             plete public key authentication, followed by either password or
             keyboard interactive authentication.  Only methods that are
             next in one or more lists are offered at each stage, so for
             this example it would not be possible to attempt password or
             keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.

             For keyboard interactive authentication it is also possible to
             restrict authentication to a specific device by appending a
             colon followed by the device identifier <b>bsdauth</b>, <b>pam</b>, or <b>skey</b>,
             depending on the server configuration.  For example,
             "keyboard-interactive:bsdauth" would restrict keyboard interac‐
             tive authentication to the <b>bsdauth </b>device.

             If the publickey method is listed more than once, sshd(8) veri‐
             fies that keys that have been used successfully are not reused
             for subsequent authentications.  For example,
             "publickey,publickey" requires successful authentication using
             two different public keys.

             Note that each authentication method listed should also be
             explicitly enabled in the configuration.

     <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand</b>
             Specifies a program to be used to look up the user's public
             keys.  The program must be owned by root, not writable by group
             or others and specified by an absolute path.  Arguments to
             <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand </b>accept the tokens described in the <i>TOKENS</i>
             section.  If no arguments are specified then the username of
             the target user is used.

             The program should produce on standard output zero or more
             lines of authorized_keys output (see <i>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</i> in
             sshd(8)).  If a key supplied by <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand </b>does not
             successfully authenticate and authorize the user then public
             key authentication continues using the usual <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
             files.  By default, no <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand </b>is run.

     <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</b>
             Specifies the user under whose account the
             <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand </b>is run.  It is recommended to use a dedi‐
             cated user that has no other role on the host than running
             authorized keys commands.  If <b>AuthorizedKeysCommand </b>is speci‐
             fied but <b>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser </b>is not, then sshd(8) will
             refuse to start.

     <b>AuthorizedKeysFile</b>
             Specifies the file that contains the public keys used for user
             authentication.  The format is described in the <i>AUTHORIZED_KEYS</i>
             <i>FILE FORMAT</i> section of sshd(8).  Arguments to
             <b>AuthorizedKeysFile </b>accept the tokens described in the <i>TOKENS</i>
             section.  After expansion, <b>AuthorizedKeysFile </b>is taken to be an
             absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory.
             Multiple files may be listed, separated by whitespace.  Alter‐
             nately this option may be set to <b>none </b>to skip checking for user
             keys in files.  The default is ".ssh/authorized_keys
             .ssh/authorized_keys2".

     <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>
             Specifies a program to be used to generate the list of allowed
             certificate principals as per <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>.  The
             program must be owned by root, not writable by group or others
             and specified by an absolute path.  Arguments to
             <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand </b>accept the tokens described in the
             <i>TOKENS</i> section.  If no arguments are specified then the user‐
             name of the target user is used.

             The program should produce on standard output zero or more
             lines of <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile </b>output.  If either
             <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand </b>or <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile </b>is
             specified, then certificates offered by the client for authen‐
             tication must contain a principal that is listed.  By default,
             no <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand </b>is run.

     <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</b>
             Specifies the user under whose account the
             <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand </b>is run.  It is recommended to use a
             dedicated user that has no other role on the host than running
             authorized principals commands.  If <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</b>
             is specified but <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser </b>is not, then
             sshd(8) will refuse to start.

     <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile</b>
             Specifies a file that lists principal names that are accepted
             for certificate authentication.  When using certificates signed
             by a key listed in <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>, this file lists names,
             one of which must appear in the certificate for it to be
             accepted for authentication.  Names are listed one per line
             preceded by key options (as described in <i>AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE</i>
             <i>FORMAT</i> in sshd(8)).  Empty lines and comments starting with ‘#’
             are ignored.

             Arguments to <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile </b>accept the tokens
             described in the <i>TOKENS</i> section.  After expansion,
             <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile </b>is taken to be an absolute path or one
             relative to the user's home directory.  The default is <b>none</b>,
             i.e. not to use a principals file – in this case, the username
             of the user must appear in a certificate's principals list for
             it to be accepted.

             Note that <b>AuthorizedPrincipalsFile </b>is only used when authenti‐
             cation proceeds using a CA listed in <b>TrustedUserCAKeys </b>and is
             not consulted for certification authorities trusted via
             <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>, though the <b>principals= </b>key option
             offers a similar facility (see sshd(8) for details).

     <b>Banner  </b>The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user
             before authentication is allowed.  If the argument is <b>none </b>then
             no banner is displayed.  By default, no banner is displayed.

     <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether challenge-response authentication is allowed
             (e.g. via PAM or through authentication styles supported in
             login.conf(5)) The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>ChrootDirectory</b>
             Specifies the pathname of a directory to chroot(2) to after
             authentication.  At session startup sshd(8) checks that all
             components of the pathname are root-owned directories which are
             not writable by any other user or group.  After the chroot,
             sshd(8) changes the working directory to the user's home direc‐
             tory.  Arguments to <b>ChrootDirectory </b>accept the tokens described
             in the <i>TOKENS</i> section.

             The <b>ChrootDirectory </b>must contain the necessary files and direc‐
             tories to support the user's session.  For an interactive ses‐
             sion this requires at least a shell, typically sh(1), and basic
             <i>/dev</i> nodes such as null(4), zero(4), stdin(4), stdout(4),
             stderr(4), and tty(4) devices.  For file transfer sessions
             using SFTP no additional configuration of the environment is
             necessary if the in-process sftp-server is used, though ses‐
             sions which use logging may require <i>/dev/log</i> inside the chroot
             directory on some operating systems (see sftp-server(8) for
             details).

             For safety, it is very important that the directory hierarchy
             be prevented from modification by other processes on the system
             (especially those outside the jail).  Misconfiguration can lead
             to unsafe environments which sshd(8) cannot detect.

             The default is <b>none</b>, indicating not to chroot(2).

     <b>Ciphers</b>
             Specifies the ciphers allowed.  Multiple ciphers must be comma-
             separated.  If the specified value begins with a ‘+’ character,
             then the specified ciphers will be appended to the default set
             instead of replacing them.  If the specified value begins with
             a ‘-’ character, then the specified ciphers (including wild‐
             cards) will be removed from the default set instead of replac‐
             ing them.

             The supported ciphers are:

                   3des-cbc
                   aes128-cbc
                   aes192-cbc
                   aes256-cbc
                   aes128-ctr
                   aes192-ctr
                   aes256-ctr
                   aes128-gcm@openssh.com
                   aes256-gcm@openssh.com
                   arcfour
                   arcfour128
                   arcfour256
                   blowfish-cbc
                   cast128-cbc
                   chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

             The default is:

                   chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,
                   aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,
                   aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com

             The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using "ssh
             -Q cipher".

     <b>ClientAliveCountMax</b>
             Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent
             without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client.
             If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are
             being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the
             session.  It is important to note that the use of client alive
             messages is very different from <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>.  The client alive
             messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore
             will not be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive option enabled by
             <b>TCPKeepAlive </b>is spoofable.  The client alive mechanism is valu‐
             able when the client or server depend on knowing when a connec‐
             tion has become inactive.

             The default value is 3.  If <b>ClientAliveInterval </b>is set to 15,
             and <b>ClientAliveCountMax </b>is left at the default, unresponsive
             SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 sec‐
             onds.

     <b>ClientAliveInterval</b>
             Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has
             been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message
             through the encrypted channel to request a response from the
             client.  The default is 0, indicating that these messages will
             not be sent to the client.

     <b>Compression</b>
             Specifies whether compression is enabled after the user has
             authenticated successfully.  The argument must be <b>yes</b>, <b>delayed</b>
             (a legacy synonym for <b>yes</b>) or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>DenyGroups</b>
             This keyword can be followed by a list of group name patterns,
             separated by spaces.  Login is disallowed for users whose pri‐
             mary group or supplementary group list matches one of the pat‐
             terns.  Only group names are valid; a numerical group ID is not
             recognized.  By default, login is allowed for all groups.  The
             allow/deny directives are processed in the following order:
             <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>, <b>DenyGroups</b>, and finally <b>AllowGroups</b>.

             See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

     <b>DenyUsers</b>
             This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns,
             separated by spaces.  Login is disallowed for user names that
             match one of the patterns.  Only user names are valid; a numer‐
             ical user ID is not recognized.  By default, login is allowed
             for all users.  If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then
             USER and HOST are separately checked, restricting logins to
             particular users from particular hosts.  HOST criteria may
             additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
             format.  The allow/deny directives are processed in the follow‐
             ing order: <b>DenyUsers</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>, <b>DenyGroups</b>, and finally
             <b>AllowGroups</b>.

             See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

     <b>DisableForwarding</b>
             Disables all forwarding features, including X11, ssh-agent(1),
             TCP and StreamLocal.  This option overrides all other forward‐
             ing-related options and may simplify restricted configurations.

     <b>FingerprintHash</b>
             Specifies the hash algorithm used when logging key finger‐
             prints.  Valid options are: <b>md5 </b>and <b>sha256</b>.  The default is
             <b>sha256</b>.

     <b>ForceCommand</b>
             Forces the execution of the command specified by <b>ForceCommand</b>,
             ignoring any command supplied by the client and <i>~/.ssh/rc</i> if
             present.  The command is invoked by using the user's login
             shell with the -c option.  This applies to shell, command, or
             subsystem execution.  It is most useful inside a <b>Match </b>block.
             The command originally supplied by the client is available in
             the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable.  Specifying a
             command of <b>internal-sftp </b>will force the use of an in-process
             SFTP server that requires no support files when used with
             <b>ChrootDirectory</b>.  The default is <b>none</b>.

     <b>GatewayPorts</b>
             Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports
             forwarded for the client.  By default, sshd(8) binds remote
             port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents other
             remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.  <b>GatewayPorts</b>
             can be used to specify that sshd should allow remote port for‐
             wardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other
             hosts to connect.  The argument may be <b>no </b>to force remote port
             forwardings to be available to the local host only, <b>yes </b>to
             force remote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard address,
             or <b>clientspecified </b>to allow the client to select the address to
             which the forwarding is bound.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>GSSAPIAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is
             allowed.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>GSSAPICleanupCredentials</b>
             Specifies whether to automatically destroy the user's creden‐
             tials cache on logout.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck</b>
             Determines whether to be strict about the identity of the GSS‐
             API acceptor a client authenticates against.  If set to <b>yes</b>
             then the client must authenticate against the host service on
             the current hostname.  If set to <b>no </b>then the client may authen‐
             ticate against any service key stored in the machine's default
             store.  This facility is provided to assist with operation on
             multi homed machines.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes</b>
             Specifies the key types that will be accepted for hostbased
             authentication as a comma-separated pattern list.  Alternately
             if the specified value begins with a ‘+’ character, then the
             specified key types will be appended to the default set instead
             of replacing them.  If the specified value begins with a ‘-’
             character, then the specified key types (including wildcards)
             will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.
             The default for this option is:

                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa

             The list of available key types may also be obtained using "ssh
             -Q key".

     <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv authentication
             together with successful public key client host authentication
             is allowed (host-based authentication).  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly</b>
             Specifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a
             reverse name lookup when matching the name in the <i>~/.shosts</i>,
             <i>~/.rhosts</i>, and <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> files during
             <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.  A setting of <b>yes </b>means that sshd(8)
             uses the name supplied by the client rather than attempting to
             resolve the name from the TCP connection itself.  The default
             is <b>no</b>.

     <b>HostCertificate</b>
             Specifies a file containing a public host certificate.  The
             certificate's public key must match a private host key already
             specified by <b>HostKey</b>.  The default behaviour of sshd(8) is not
             to load any certificates.

     <b>HostKey</b>
             Specifies a file containing a private host key used by SSH.
             The defaults are <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</i>,
             <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</i>, <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</i> and
             <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</i>.

             Note that sshd(8) will refuse to use a file if it is
             group/world-accessible and that the <b>HostKeyAlgorithms </b>option
             restricts which of the keys are actually used by sshd(8).

             It is possible to have multiple host key files.  It is also
             possible to specify public host key files instead.  In this
             case operations on the private key will be delegated to an
             ssh-agent(1).

     <b>HostKeyAgent</b>
             Identifies the UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with an
             agent that has access to the private host keys.  If the string
             "SSH_AUTH_SOCK" is specified, the location of the socket will
             be read from the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.

     <b>HostKeyAlgorithms</b>
             Specifies the host key algorithms that the server offers.  The
             default for this option is:

                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa

             The list of available key types may also be obtained using "ssh
             -Q key".

     <b>IgnoreRhosts</b>
             Specifies that <i>.rhosts</i> and <i>.shosts</i> files will not be used in
             <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.

             <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> and <i>/etc/shosts.equiv</i> are still used.  The
             default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>IgnoreUserKnownHosts</b>
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should ignore the user's
             <i>~/.ssh/known_hosts</i> during <b>HostbasedAuthentication</b>.  The default
             is <b>no</b>.

     <b>IPQoS   </b>Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for the con‐
             nection.  Accepted values are <b>af11</b>, <b>af12</b>, <b>af13</b>, <b>af21</b>, <b>af22</b>,
             <b>af23</b>, <b>af31</b>, <b>af32</b>, <b>af33</b>, <b>af41</b>, <b>af42</b>, <b>af43</b>, <b>cs0</b>, <b>cs1</b>, <b>cs2</b>, <b>cs3</b>,
             <b>cs4</b>, <b>cs5</b>, <b>cs6</b>, <b>cs7</b>, <b>ef</b>, <b>lowdelay</b>, <b>throughput</b>, <b>reliability</b>, or a
             numeric value.  This option may take one or two arguments, sep‐
             arated by whitespace.  If one argument is specified, it is used
             as the packet class unconditionally.  If two values are speci‐
             fied, the first is automatically selected for interactive ses‐
             sions and the second for non-interactive sessions.  The default
             is <b>lowdelay </b>for interactive sessions and <b>throughput </b>for non-
             interactive sessions.

     <b>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether to allow keyboard-interactive authentication.
             The argument to this keyword must be <b>yes </b>or <b>no</b>.  The default is
             to use whatever value <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication </b>is set to
             (by default <b>yes</b>).

     <b>KerberosAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether the password provided by the user for
             <b>PasswordAuthentication </b>will be validated through the Kerberos
             KDC.  To use this option, the server needs a Kerberos servtab
             which allows the verification of the KDC's identity.  The
             default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>KerberosGetAFSToken</b>
             If AFS is active and the user has a Kerberos 5 TGT, attempt to
             acquire an AFS token before accessing the user's home direc‐
             tory.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>KerberosOrLocalPasswd</b>
             If password authentication through Kerberos fails then the
             password will be validated via any additional local mechanism
             such as <i>/etc/passwd</i>.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>KerberosTicketCleanup</b>
             Specifies whether to automatically destroy the user's ticket
             cache file on logout.  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>KexAlgorithms</b>
             Specifies the available KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms.  Multi‐
             ple algorithms must be comma-separated.  Alternately if the
             specified value begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified
             methods will be appended to the default set instead of replac‐
             ing them.  If the specified value begins with a ‘-’ character,
             then the specified methods (including wildcards) will be
             removed from the default set instead of replacing them.  The
             supported algorithms are:

                   curve25519-sha256
                   curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
                   diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
                   diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
                   ecdh-sha2-nistp256
                   ecdh-sha2-nistp384
                   ecdh-sha2-nistp521

             The default is:

                   curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,
                   ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,
                   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,
                   diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

             The list of available key exchange algorithms may also be
             obtained using "ssh -Q kex".

     <b>ListenAddress</b>
             Specifies the local addresses sshd(8) should listen on.  The
             following forms may be used:

                   <b>ListenAddress </b><i>host</i>|<i>IPv4_addr</i>|<i>IPv6_addr</i>
                   <b>ListenAddress </b><i>host</i>|<i>IPv4_addr</i>:<i>port</i>
                   <b>ListenAddress </b>[<i>host</i>|<i>IPv6_addr</i>]:<i>port</i>

             If <i>port</i> is not specified, sshd will listen on the address and
             all <b>Port </b>options specified.  The default is to listen on all
             local addresses.  Multiple <b>ListenAddress </b>options are permitted.

     <b>LoginGraceTime</b>
             The server disconnects after this time if the user has not suc‐
             cessfully logged in.  If the value is 0, there is no time
             limit.  The default is 120 seconds.

     <b>LogLevel</b>
             Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages
             from sshd(8).  The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR,
             INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default
             is INFO.  DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3
             each specify higher levels of debugging output.  Logging with a
             DEBUG level violates the privacy of users and is not recom‐
             mended.

     <b>MACs    </b>Specifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algo‐
             rithms.  The MAC algorithm is used for data integrity protec‐
             tion.  Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.  If the
             specified value begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified
             algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of
             replacing them.  If the specified value begins with a ‘-’ char‐
             acter, then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will
             be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.

             The algorithms that contain "-etm" calculate the MAC after
             encryption (encrypt-then-mac).  These are considered safer and
             their use recommended.  The supported MACs are:

                   hmac-md5
                   hmac-md5-96
                   hmac-ripemd160
                   hmac-sha1
                   hmac-sha1-96
                   hmac-sha2-256
                   hmac-sha2-512
                   umac-64@openssh.com
                   umac-128@openssh.com
                   hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-md5-96-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-sha1-96-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
                   hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
                   umac-64-etm@openssh.com
                   umac-128-etm@openssh.com

             The default is:

                   umac-64-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,
                   hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,
                   hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,
                   umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,
                   hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha1

             The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using
             "ssh -Q mac".

     <b>Match   </b>Introduces a conditional block.  If all of the criteria on the
             <b>Match </b>line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines
             override those set in the global section of the config file,
             until either another <b>Match </b>line or the end of the file.  If a
             keyword appears in multiple <b>Match </b>blocks that are satisfied,
             only the first instance of the keyword is applied.

             The arguments to <b>Match </b>are one or more criteria-pattern pairs
             or the single token <b>All </b>which matches all criteria.  The avail‐
             able criteria are <b>User</b>, <b>Group</b>, <b>Host</b>, <b>LocalAddress</b>, <b>LocalPort</b>,
             and <b>Address</b>.  The match patterns may consist of single entries
             or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation
             operators described in the <i>PATTERNS</i> section of ssh_config(5).

             The patterns in an <b>Address </b>criteria may additionally contain
             addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as
             192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32.  Note that the mask length pro‐
             vided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to
             specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one
             with bits set in this host portion of the address.  For exam‐
             ple, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.

             Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a
             <b>Match </b>keyword.  Available keywords are <b>AcceptEnv</b>,
             <b>AllowAgentForwarding</b>, <b>AllowGroups</b>, <b>AllowStreamLocalForwarding</b>,
             <b>AllowTcpForwarding</b>, <b>AllowUsers</b>, <b>AuthenticationMethods</b>,

     <b>MaxAuthTries</b>
             Specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permit‐
             ted per connection.  Once the number of failures reaches half
             this value, additional failures are logged.  The default is 6.

     <b>MaxSessions</b>
             Specifies the maximum number of open shell, login or subsystem
             (e.g. sftp) sessions permitted per network connection.  Multi‐
             ple sessions may be established by clients that support connec‐
             tion multiplexing.  Setting <b>MaxSessions </b>to 1 will effectively
             disable session multiplexing, whereas setting it to 0 will pre‐
             vent all shell, login and subsystem sessions while still per‐
             mitting forwarding.  The default is 10.

     <b>MaxStartups</b>
             Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated con‐
             nections to the SSH daemon.  Additional connections will be
             dropped until authentication succeeds or the <b>LoginGraceTime</b>
             expires for a connection.  The default is 10:30:100.

             Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying
             the three colon separated values start:rate:full (e.g.
             "10:30:60").  sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with a
             probability of rate/100 (30%) if there are currently start (10)
             unauthenticated connections.  The probability increases lin‐
             early and all connection attempts are refused if the number of
             unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).

     <b>PasswordAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether password authentication is allowed.  The
             default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>PermitEmptyPasswords</b>
             When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether
             the server allows login to accounts with empty password
             strings.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>PermitOpen</b>
             Specifies the destinations to which TCP port forwarding is per‐
             mitted.  The forwarding specification must be one of the fol‐
             lowing forms:

                   <b>PermitOpen </b><i>host</i>:<i>port</i>
                   <b>PermitOpen </b><i>IPv4_addr</i>:<i>port</i>
                   <b>PermitOpen </b><i>[IPv6_addr]</i>:<i>port</i>

             Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with
             whitespace.  An argument of <b>any </b>can be used to remove all
             restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.  An argument
             of <b>none </b>can be used to prohibit all forwarding requests.  The
             wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or
             ports, respectively.  By default all port forwarding requests
             are permitted.

     <b>PermitRootLogin</b>
             Specifies whether root can log in using ssh(1).  The argument
             must be <b>yes</b>, <b>prohibit-password</b>, <b>without-password</b>,
             <b>forced-commands-only</b>, or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>prohibit-password</b>.

             If this option is set to <b>prohibit-password </b>or <b>without-password</b>,
             password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled
             for root.

             If this option is set to <b>forced-commands-only</b>, root login with
             public key authentication will be allowed, but only if the
             <i>command</i> option has been specified (which may be useful for tak‐
             ing remote backups even if root login is normally not allowed).
             All other authentication methods are disabled for root.

             If this option is set to <b>no</b>, root is not allowed to log in.

     <b>PermitTTY</b>
             Specifies whether pty(4) allocation is permitted.  The default
             is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>PermitTunnel</b>
             Specifies whether tun(4) device forwarding is allowed.  The
             argument must be <b>yes</b>, <b>point-to-point </b>(layer 3), <b>ethernet </b>(layer
             2), or <b>no</b>.  Specifying <b>yes </b>permits both <b>point-to-point </b>and
             <b>ethernet</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

             Independent of this setting, the permissions of the selected
             tun(4) device must allow access to the user.

     <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b>
             Specifies whether <i>~/.ssh/environment</i> and <b>environment= </b>options
             in <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> are processed by sshd(8).  The
             default is <b>no</b>.  Enabling environment processing may enable
             users to bypass access restrictions in some configurations
             using mechanisms such as LD_PRELOAD.

     <b>PermitUserRC</b>
             Specifies whether any <i>~/.ssh/rc</i> file is executed.  The default
             is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>PidFile</b>
             Specifies the file that contains the process ID of the SSH dae‐
             mon, or <b>none </b>to not write one.  The default is
             <i>/var/run/sshd.pid</i>.

     <b>Port    </b>Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on.  The default
             is 22.  Multiple options of this type are permitted.  See also
             <b>ListenAddress</b>.

     <b>PrintLastLog</b>
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should print the date and time of the
             last user login when a user logs in interactively.  The default
             is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>PrintMotd</b>
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should print <i>/etc/motd</i> when a user
             logs in interactively.  (On some systems it is also printed by
             the shell, <i>/etc/profile</i>, or equivalent.)  The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes</b>
             Specifies the key types that will be accepted for public key
             authentication as a comma-separated pattern list.  Alternately
             if the specified value begins with a ‘+’ character, then the
             specified key types will be appended to the default set instead
             of replacing them.  If the specified value begins with a ‘-’
             character, then the specified key types (including wildcards)
             will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.
             The default for this option is:

                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,
                ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
                ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa

             The list of available key types may also be obtained using "ssh
             -Q key".

     <b>PubkeyAuthentication</b>
             Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed.  The
             default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>RekeyLimit</b>
             Specifies the maximum amount of data that may be transmitted
             before the session key is renegotiated, optionally followed a
             maximum amount of time that may pass before the session key is
             renegotiated.  The first argument is specified in bytes and may
             have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate Kilobytes,
             Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is between
             ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher.  The optional second
             value is specified in seconds and may use any of the units doc‐
             umented in the <i>TIME FORMATS</i> section.  The default value for
             <b>RekeyLimit </b>is <b>default none</b>, which means that rekeying is per‐
             formed after the cipher's default amount of data has been sent
             or received and no time based rekeying is done.

     <b>RevokedKeys</b>
             Specifies revoked public keys file, or <b>none </b>to not use one.
             Keys listed in this file will be refused for public key authen‐
             tication.  Note that if this file is not readable, then public
             key authentication will be refused for all users.  Keys may be
             specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or
             as an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by
             ssh-keygen(1).  For more information on KRLs, see the KEY REVO‐
             CATION LISTS section in ssh-keygen(1).

     <b>StreamLocalBindMask</b>
             Sets the octal file creation mode mask (umask) used when creat‐
             ing a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote port forward‐
             ing.  This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-
             domain socket file.

             The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket
             file that is readable and writable only by the owner.  Note
             that not all operating systems honor the file mode on Unix-
             domain socket files.

     <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink</b>
             Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file
             for local or remote port forwarding before creating a new one.
             If the socket file already exists and <b>StreamLocalBindUnlink </b>is
             not enabled, <b>sshd </b>will be unable to forward the port to the
             Unix-domain socket file.  This option is only used for port
             forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

             The argument must be <b>yes </b>or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>StrictModes</b>
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should check file modes and ownership
             of the user's files and home directory before accepting login.
             This is normally desirable because novices sometimes acciden‐
             tally leave their directory or files world-writable.  The
             default is <b>yes</b>.  Note that this does not apply to
             <b>ChrootDirectory</b>, whose permissions and ownership are checked
             unconditionally.

     <b>Subsystem</b>
             Configures an external subsystem (e.g. file transfer daemon).
             Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command (with
             optional arguments) to execute upon subsystem request.

             The command <b>sftp-server </b>implements the SFTP file transfer sub‐
             system.

             Alternately the name <b>internal-sftp </b>implements an in-process
             SFTP server.  This may simplify configurations using
             <b>ChrootDirectory </b>to force a different filesystem root on
             clients.

             By default no subsystems are defined.

     <b>SyslogFacility</b>
             Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from
             sshd(8).  The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0,
             LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.  The
             default is AUTH.

     <b>TCPKeepAlive</b>
             Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages
             to the other side.  If they are sent, death of the connection
             or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  How‐
             ever, this means that connections will die if the route is down
             temporarily, and some people find it annoying.  On the other
             hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent, sessions may hang indefi‐
             nitely on the server, leaving "ghost" users and consuming
             server resources.

             The default is <b>yes </b>(to send TCP keepalive messages), and the
             server will notice if the network goes down or the client host
             crashes.  This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

             To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
             <b>no</b>.

     <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>
             Specifies a file containing public keys of certificate authori‐
             ties that are trusted to sign user certificates for authentica‐
             tion, or <b>none </b>to not use one.  Keys are listed one per line;
             empty lines and comments starting with ‘#’ are allowed.  If a
             certificate is presented for authentication and has its signing
             CA key listed in this file, then it may be used for authentica‐
             tion for any user listed in the certificate's principals list.
             Note that certificates that lack a list of principals will not
             be permitted for authentication using <b>TrustedUserCAKeys</b>.  For
             more details on certificates, see the CERTIFICATES section in
             ssh-keygen(1).

     <b>UseDNS  </b>Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the remote host name,
             and to check that the resolved host name for the remote IP
             address maps back to the very same IP address.

             If this option is set to <b>no </b>(the default) then only addresses
             and not host names may be used in <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> <b>from</b>
             and <b>sshd_config Match Host </b>directives.

     <b>UsePAM  </b>Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface.  If set
             to <b>yes </b>this will enable PAM authentication using
             <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication </b>and <b>PasswordAuthentication </b>in
             addition to PAM account and session module processing for all
             authentication types.

             Because PAM challenge-response authentication usually serves an
             equivalent role to password authentication, you should disable
             either <b>PasswordAuthentication </b>or
             <b>ChallengeResponseAuthentication.</b>

             If <b>UsePAM </b>is enabled, you will not be able to run sshd(8) as a
             non-root user.  The default is <b>no</b>.

     <b>VersionAddendum</b>
             Optionally specifies additional text to append to the SSH pro‐
             tocol banner sent by the server upon connection.  The default
             is <b>none</b>.

     <b>X11DisplayOffset</b>
             Specifies the first display number available for sshd(8)'s X11
             forwarding.  This prevents sshd from interfering with real X11
             servers.  The default is 10.

     <b>X11Forwarding</b>
             Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted.  The argument
             must be <b>yes </b>or <b>no</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

             When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be additional expo‐
             sure to the server and to client displays if the sshd(8) proxy
             display is configured to listen on the wildcard address (see
             <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>), though this is not the default.  Addition‐
             ally, the authentication spoofing and authentication data veri‐
             fication and substitution occur on the client side.  The secu‐
             rity risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 dis‐
             play server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client
             requests forwarding (see the warnings for <b>ForwardX11 </b>in
             ssh_config(5)).  A system administrator may have a stance in
             which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves
             to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can
             warrant a <b>no </b>setting.

             Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent users from
             forwarding X11 traffic, as users can always install their own
             forwarders.

     <b>X11UseLocalhost</b>
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should bind the X11 forwarding server
             to the loopback address or to the wildcard address.  By
             default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback
             address and sets the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment
             variable to <b>localhost</b>.  This prevents remote hosts from con‐
             necting to the proxy display.  However, some older X11 clients
             may not function with this configuration.  <b>X11UseLocalhost </b>may
             be set to <b>no </b>to specify that the forwarding server should be
             bound to the wildcard address.  The argument must be <b>yes </b>or <b>no</b>.
             The default is <b>yes</b>.

     <b>XAuthLocation</b>
             Specifies the full pathname of the xauth(1) program, or <b>none </b>to
             not use one.  The default is <i>/usr/X11R6/bin/xauth</i>.

     sshd(8) command-line arguments and configuration file options that
     specify time may be expressed using a sequence of the form:
     <i>time</i>[<i>qualifier</i>], where <i>time</i> is a positive integer value and <i>qualifier</i>
     is one of the following:

           ⟨<b>none</b>⟩  seconds
           <b>s </b>| <b>S   </b>seconds
           <b>m </b>| <b>M   </b>minutes

           <b>d </b>| <b>D   </b>days
           <b>w </b>| <b>W   </b>weeks

     Each member of the sequence is added together to calculate the total
     time value.

     at runtime:

           %%    A literal ‘%’.
           %F    The fingerprint of the CA key.
           %f    The fingerprint of the key or certificate.
           %h    The home directory of the user.

     Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos,
     Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer features
     and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH
     protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.  Niels Provos and Markus Friedl contrib‐
     uted support for privilege separation.
