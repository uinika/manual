       Yum uses a configuration file at <b>/etc/yum/yum.conf</b>.

       Additional configuration files are also read from the directories set
       by the <b>reposdir </b>option (default is `/etc/yum/repos.d').  See the
       <b>reposdir </b>option below for further details.

<h2><a id="PARAMETERS" href="#PARAMETERS"></a>PARAMETERS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There are two types of sections in the yum configuration file(s):
       main and repository. Main defines all global configuration options.
       There should be only one main section. The repository section(s)
       define the configuration for each repository/server. There should be
       one or more repository sections.
</pre>
<h2><a id="[main]_OPTIONS" href="#[main]_OPTIONS"></a>[main] OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The [main] section must exist for yum to do anything. It consists of
       the following options:

              <b>cachedir </b>Directory where yum should store its cache and db
              files. The default is `/var/cache/yum'.

              <b>cashe_root_dir </b>Directory where yum would initialize the cashe,
              should almost certainly be left at the default. The default
              is`/var/cache/CAShe'. Note that unlike all other
              configuration, this does not change with installroot, the
              reason is so that multiple install root can share the same
              data. See man cashe for more info.

              <b>persistdir </b>Directory where yum should store information that
              should persist over multiple runs. The default is
              `/var/lib/yum'.

              <b>keepcache </b>Either `1' or `0'. Determines whether or not yum
              keeps the cache of headers and packages after successful
              installation.  Default is '1' (keep files)

              <b>reposdir </b>A list of directories where yum should look for .repo
              files which define repositories to use. Default is
              `/etc/yum/repos.d'. Each file in this directory should contain
              one or more repository sections as documented in <b>[repository]</b>
              <b>options </b>below. These will be merged with the repositories
              defined in /etc/yum/yum.conf to form the complete set of
              repositories that yum will use.

              <b>debuglevel </b>Debug message output level. Practical range is
              0-10. Default is `2'.

              <b>errorlevel </b>Error message output level. Practical range is
              0-10. Default is `2'.

              <b>rpmverbosity </b>Debug scriptlet output level. 'info' is the
              default, other options are: 'critical', 'emergency', 'error',
              'warn' and 'debug'.

              <b>protected_packages </b>This is a list of packages that yum should
              never completely remove. They are protected via Obsoletes as
              well as user/plugin removals.

              The default is: yum glob:/etc/yum/protected.d/*.conf So any
              packages which should be protected can do so by including a
              file in /etc/yum/protected.d with their package name in it.

              Also if this configuration is set to anything, then yum will
              protect the package corresponding to the running version of
              the kernel.

              <b>protected_multilib </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether
              or not it should perform a check to make sure that multilib
              packages are the same version. For example, if this option is
              off (rpm behavior) then in some cases it might be possible for
              pkgA-1.x86_64 and pkgA-2.i386 to be installed at the same
              time. However this is very rarely desired. Install only
              packages, like the kernel, are exempt from this check.  The
              default is `1'.

              <b>logfile </b>Full directory and file name for where yum should
              write its log file.

              <b>gpgcheck </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not it
              should perform a GPG signature check on packages. When this is
              set in the [main] section it sets the default for all
              repositories.  The default is `0'.

              <b>localpkg_gpgcheck </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or
              not it should perform a GPG signature check on local packages
              (packages in a file, not in a repositoy).  The default is `0'.

              <b>repo_gpgcheck </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not
              it should perform a GPG signature check on the repodata. When
              this is set in the [main] section it sets the default for all
              repositories. The default is `0'.

              <b>skip_broken </b>Either `1' or `0'. Resolve depsolve problems by
              removing packages that are causing problems from the
              transaction.

              <b>assumeyes </b>Either `1' or `0'. Determines whether or not yum
              prompts for confirmation of critical actions. Default is `0'
              (do prompt).
              Command-line option: <b>-y --assumeyes</b>

              <b>assumeno </b>Either `1' or `0'. If yum would prompt for
              confirmation of critical actions, assume the user chose no.
              This is basically the same as doing "echo | yum ..."  but is a
              bit more usable. This option overrides <b>assumeyes</b>, but is still
              subject to <b>alwaysprompt</b>.  Default is `0' (do prompt).
              Command-line option: <b>--assumeno</b>

              <b>alwaysprompt </b>Either `1' or `0'. When set to `0', yum will not
              prompt for confirmation when the list of packages to be
              installed exactly matches those given on the command line.
              Unless <b>assumeyes </b>is enabled, it will prompt when additional
              packages need to be installed to fulfill dependencies
              regardless of this setting. Note that older versions of yum
              would also always prompt for package removal, and that is no
              longer true.  Default is `1'.

              <b>tolerant </b>Either `1' or `0'. If enabled, yum will go slower,
              checking for things that shouldn't be possible making it more
              tolerant of external errors.  Default to `0' (not tolerant).
              Command-line option: <b>-t</b>

              <b>exclude </b>List of packages to exclude from all repositories, so
              yum works as if that package was never in the repositories.
              This should be a space separated list.  This is commonly used
              so a package isn't upgraded or installed accidentally, but can
              be used to remove packages in any way that "yum list" will
              show packages.  Shell globs using wildcards (eg. * and ?) are
              allowed.

              Can be disabled using disable_excludes or --disableexcludes.
              Command-line option: <b>-x</b>

              <b>disable_excludes </b>A way to permanently set the
              --disableexcludes command line option.

              <b>query_install_excludes </b>This applies the command line exclude
              option (only, not the configuration exclude above) to
              installed packages being shown in some query commands
              (currently: list/info/search/provides). Default is '0'.

              <b>installonlypkgs </b>List of package provides that should only ever
              be installed, never updated.  Kernels in particular fall into
              this category. Defaults to kernel, kernel-bigmem, kernel-
              enterprise, kernel-smp, kernel-modules, kernel-debug, kernel-
              unsupported, kernel-source, kernel-devel, kernel-PAE, kernel-
              PAE-debug.

              Note that because these are provides, and not just package
              names, kernel-devel will also apply to kernel-debug-devel,
              etc.

              <b>installonly_limit </b>Number of packages listed in installonlypkgs
              to keep installed at the same time. Setting to 0 disables this
              feature. Default is '0'. Note that this functionality used to
              be in the "installonlyn" plugin, where this option was altered
              via tokeep.  Note that as of version 3.2.24, yum will now look
              in the yumdb for a installonly attribute on installed
              packages. If that attribute is "keep", then they will never be
              removed.

              <b>kernelpkgnames </b>List of package names that are kernels. This is
              really only here for the updating of kernel packages and
              should be removed out in the yum 2.1 series.

              <b>showdupesfromrepos </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set to `1' if you wish
              to show any duplicate packages from any repository, from
              package listings like the info or list commands. Set to `0' if
              you want only to see the newest packages from any repository.
              Default is `0'.

              <b>obsoletes </b>This option only has affect during an <b>update</b>. It
              enables yum's obsoletes processing logic. Useful when doing
              distribution level upgrades. See also the yum <b>upgrade </b>command
              documentation for more details (yum(8)).  Default is `true'.
              Command-line option: <b>--obsoletes</b>

              <b>remove_leaf_only </b>Either `0' or `1'. Used to determine yum's
              behaviour when a package is removed.  If <b>remove_leaf_only </b>is
              `0' (default) then packages, and their deps, will be removed.
              If <b>remove_leaf_only </b>is `1' then only those packages that
              aren't required by another package will be removed.

              <b>repopkgsremove_leaf_only </b>Either `0' or `1'. Used to determine
              yum's behaviour when the repo-pkg remove command is run.  If
              <b>repopkgremove_leaf_only </b>is `0' (default) then all packages in
              the repo. will be removed.  If <b>repopkgremove_leaf_only </b>is `1'
              then only those packages in the repo. that aren't required by
              another package will be removed.  Note that this option does
              not override remove_leaf_only, so enabling that option means
              this has almost no affect.

              <b>overwrite_groups </b>Either `0' or `1'. Used to determine yum's
              behaviour if two or more repositories offer the package groups
              with the same name. If <b>overwrite_groups </b>is `1' then the group
              packages of the last matching repository will be used. If
              <b>overwrite_groups </b>is `0' then the groups from all matching
              repositories will be merged together as one large group.  Note
              that this option does not override remove_leaf_only, so
              enabling that option means this has almost no affect.

              <b>groupremove_leaf_only </b>Either `0' or `1'. Used to determine
              yum's behaviour when the groupremove command is run.  If
              <b>groupremove_leaf_only </b>is `0' (default) then all packages in
              the group will be removed.  If <b>groupremove_leaf_only </b>is `1'
              then only those packages in the group that aren't required by
              another package will be removed.

              <b>enable_group_conditionals </b>Either `0' or `1'. Determines
              whether yum will allow the use of conditionals packages.
              Default is `1' (package conditionals are allowed).

              <b>group_package_types </b>List of the following: optional, default,
              mandatory. Tells yum which type of packages in groups will be
              installed when 'groupinstall' is called.  Default is: default,
              mandatory

              <b>group_command </b>List of the following: simple, compat, objects.
              Tells yum what to do for group install/upgrade/remove
              commands.

              Simple acts like you did yum group cmd $(repoquery --group
              --list group), so it is very easy to reason about what will
              happen. Alas. this is often not what people want to happen.

              Compat. works much like simple, except that when you run
              "group upgrade" it actually runs "group install" (this means
              that you get any new packages added to the group, but you also
              get packages added that were there before and you didn't
              want).

              Objects makes groups act like a real object, separate from the
              packages they contain. Yum keeps track of the groups you have
              installed, so "group upgrade" will install new packages for
              the group but not install old ones. It also knows about group
              members that are installed but weren't installed as part of
              the group, and won't remove those on "group remove".  Running
              "yum upgrade" will also run "yum group upgrade" (thus. adding
              new packages for all groups).

              Default is: compat

              <b>upgrade_group_objects_upgrade </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set this to
              `0' to disable the automatic running of "group upgrade" when
              running the "upgrade" command, and group_command is set to
              "objects". Default is `1' (perform the operation).

              <b>autocheck_running_kernel </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set this to `0' to
              disable the automatic checking of the running kernel against
              updateinfo ("yum updateinfo check-running-kernel"), in the
              "check-update" and "updateinfo summary" commands.  Default is
              `1' (perform the check).

              <b>installroot </b>Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to
              which all packages will be installed.
              Command-line option: <b>--installroot</b>

              <b>config_file_path </b>Specifies the path to main the configuration
              file.  Default is /etc/yum/yum.conf.

              <b>check_config_file_age </b>Either `0' or `1'. Specifies whether yum
              should auto metadata expire repos.  that are older than any of
              the configuration files that led to them (usually the yum.conf
              file and the foo.repo file).  Default is `1' (perform the
              check).

              <b>distroverpkg </b>The package used by yum to determine the
              "version" of the distribution, this sets $releasever for use
              in config. files. This can be any installed package. Default
              is `system-release(releasever)', `redhat-release'. Yum will
              now look at the version provided by the provide, and if that
              is non-empty then will use the full V(-R), otherwise it uses
              the version of the package.
               You can see what provides this manually by using: "yum
              whatprovides 'system-release(releasever)' redhat-release" and
              you can see what $releasever is most easily by using: "yum
              version".

              <b>diskspacecheck </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set this to `0' to disable
              the checking for sufficient diskspace and inodes before a RPM
              transaction is run. Default is `1' (perform the check).

              <b>tsflags </b>Comma or space separated list of transaction flags to
              pass to the rpm transaction set. These include 'noscripts',
              'notriggers', 'nodocs', 'test', 'justdb' and 'nocontexts'.
              'repackage' is also available but that does nothing with newer
              rpm versions.  You can set all/any of them. However, if you
              don't know what these do in the context of an rpm transaction
              set you're best leaving it alone. Default is an empty list.
              Also see the "yum fs" command, for excluding docs.

              <b>override_install_langs </b>This is a way to override rpm's
              _install_langs macro. without having to change it within rpm's
              macro file.  Default is nothing (so does nothing).  Also see
              the "yum fs" command.

              <b>recent </b>Number of days back to look for `recent' packages added
              to a repository.  Used by the <b>list recent </b>command. Default is
              `7'.

              <b>retries </b>Set the number of times any attempt to retrieve a file
              should retry before returning an error. Setting this to `0'
              makes yum try forever. Default is `10'.

              <b>keepalive </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set whether HTTP keepalive should
              be used for HTTP/1.1 servers that support it. This can improve
              transfer speeds by using one connection when downloading
              multiple files from a repository. Default is `1'.

              <b>timeout </b>Number of seconds to wait for a connection before
              timing out. Defaults to 30 seconds. This may be too short of a
              time for extremely overloaded sites.

              <b>http_caching </b>Determines how upstream HTTP caches are
              instructed to handle any HTTP downloads that Yum does. This
              option can take the following values:

              `all' means that all HTTP downloads should be cached.

              `packages' means that only RPM package downloads should be
              cached (but not repository metadata downloads).

              `lazy:packages' means that act like `packages' unless package
              verification fails (e.g. the package download doesn't match
              the expected checksum), in which case try re-downloading the
              package as if `none' was set.  This value is a good compromise
              if you want to avoid issues caused by stale proxy cache after
              remote RPMs change contents without changing filenames (e.g.
              are pushed unsigned and later signed) but still want the
              benefits of package caching whenever possible.

              `none' means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.

              The default is `all'. This is recommended unless you are
              experiencing caching related issues. Try to at least use
              `packages' to minimize load on repository servers.

              <b>throttle </b>Enable bandwidth throttling for downloads. This
              option can be expressed as a absolute data rate in bytes/sec.
              An SI prefix (k, M or G) may be appended to the bandwidth
              value (eg. `5.5k' is 5.5 kilobytes/sec, `2M' is 2
              Megabytes/sec).

              Alternatively, this option can specify the percentage of total
              bandwidth to use (eg. `60%'). In this case the <b>bandwidth</b>
              option should be used to specify the maximum available
              bandwidth.

              Set to `0' to disable bandwidth throttling. This is the
              default.

              Note that when multiple downloads run simultaneously the total
              bandwidth might exceed the throttle limit. You may want to
              also set max_connections=1 or scale your throttle option down
              accordingly.

              <b>minrate </b>This sets the low speed threshold in bytes per second.
              If the server is sending data slower than this for at least
              `timeout' seconds, Yum aborts the connection. The default is
              `1000'.

              <b>bandwidth </b>Use to specify the maximum available network
              bandwidth in bytes/second.  Used with the <b>throttle </b>option
              (above). If <b>throttle </b>is a percentage and <b>bandwidth </b>is `0' then
              bandwidth throttling will be disabled. If <b>throttle </b>is
              expressed as a data rate (bytes/sec) then this option is
              ignored. Default is `0' (no bandwidth throttling).

              <b>ip_resolve </b>Determines how yum resolves host names.

              `4' or `IPv4': resolve to IPv4 addresses only.

              `6' or `IPv6': resolve to IPv6 addresses only.

              <b>max_connections</b>

              The maximum number of simultaneous connections.  This
              overrides the urlgrabber default of 5 connections.  Note that
              there are also implicit per-mirror limits and the downloader
              honors these too.

              <b>ftp_disable_epsv </b>This options disables Extended Passive Mode
              (the EPSV command) which does not work correctly on some buggy
              ftp servers. Default is `0' (EPSV enabled).

              <b>deltarpm</b>

              When non-zero, delta-RPM files are used if available.  The
              value specifies the maximum number of "applydeltarpm"
              processes Yum will spawn, if the value is negative then yum
              works out how many cores you have and multiplies that by the
              value (cores=2, deltarpm=-2; 4 processes). (2 by default).

              Note that the "applydeltarpm" process uses a significant
              amount of disk IO, so running too many instances can
              significantly slow down all disk IO including the downloads
              that yum is doing (thus. a too high value can make everything
              slower).

              <b>deltarpm_percentage </b>When the relative size of delta vs pkg is
              larger than this, delta is not used.  Default value is 75
              (Deltas must be at least 25% smaller than the pkg).  Use `0'
              to turn off delta rpm processing. Local repositories (with
              file:// baseurl) have delta rpms turned off by default.

              <b>deltarpm_metadata_percentage </b>When the relative size of
              deltarpm metadata vs pkgs is larger than this, deltarpm
              metadata is not downloaded from the repo.  Default value is
              100 (Deltarpm metadata must be smaller than the packages from
              the repo). Note that you can give values over 100, so 200
              means that the metadata is required to be half the size of the
              packages.  Use `0' to turn off this check, and always download
              metadata.

              <b>sslcacert </b>Path to the directory containing the databases of
              the certificate authorities yum should use to verify SSL
              certificates. Defaults to none - uses system default

              <b>sslverify </b>Boolean - should yum verify SSL certificates/hosts
              at all. Defaults to True.

              Note that the plugin yum-rhn-plugin will force this value to
              true, and may alter other ssl settings (like hostname
              checking), even if it the machine is not registered.

              <b>sslclientcert </b>Path to the SSL client certificate yum should
              use to connect to repos/remote sites Defaults to none.

              Note that if you are using curl compiled against NSS (default
              in Fedora/RHEL), curl treats sslclientcert values with the
              same basename as _identical_. This version of yum will check
              that this isn't true and output an error when the repositories
              "foo" and "bar" violate this, like so:

              sslclientcert basename shared between foo and bar

              <b>sslclientkey </b>Path to the SSL client key yum should use to
              connect to repos/remote sites Defaults to none.

              <b>ssl_check_cert_permissions </b>Boolean - Whether yum should check
              the permissions on the paths for the certificates on the
              repository (both remote and local). If we can't read any of
              the files then yum will force skip_if_unavailable to be true.
              This is most useful for non-root processes which use yum on
              repos. that have client cert files which are readable only by
              root.  Defaults to True.

              <b>history_record </b>Boolean - should yum record history entries for
              transactions. This takes some disk space, and some extra time
              in the transactions. But it allows how to know a lot of
              information about what has happened before, and display it to
              the user with the history info/list/summary commands. yum also
              provides the history undo/redo commands. Defaults to True.

              Note that if history is recorded, yum uses that information to
              see if any modifications to the rpmdb have been done outside
              of yum. These are always bad, from yum's point of view, and so
              yum will issue a warning and automatically run some of "yum
              check" to try and find some of the worst problems altering the
              rpmdb might have caused.

              This means that turning this option off will stop yum from
              being able to detect when the rpmdb has changed and thus. it
              will never warn you or automatically run "yum check". The
              problems will likely still be there, and yumdb etc. will still
              be wrong but yum will not warn you about it.

              <b>history_record_packages </b>This is a list of package names that
              should be recorded as having helped the transaction. yum
              plugins have an API to add themselves to this, so it should
              not normally be necessary to add packages here. Not that this
              is also used for the packages to look for in --version.
              Defaults to rpm, yum, yum-metadata-parser.

              <b>history_list_view </b>Which column of information to display in
              the "yum history list" command. There are currently three
              options: users, cmds (or commands), auto.

              Older versions of yum acted like "users", which always outputs
              the user who initiated the yum transaction. You can now
              specify "commands" which will instead always output the
              command line of the transaction. You can also specify "single-
              user-commands" which will display the users if there are more
              than one, otherwise it will display the command line.

              You can also specify "default" which currently selects
              "single-user-commands".

              <b>commands </b>List of functional commands to run if no functional
              commands are specified on the command line (eg. "update foo
              bar baz quux").  None of the short options (eg. -y, -e, -d)
              are accepted for this option.

              <b>syslog_ident </b>Identification (program name) for syslog
              messages.

              <b>syslog_facility </b>Facility name for syslog messages, see
              syslog(3).  Default is `LOG_USER'.

              <b>syslog_device </b>Where to log syslog messages. Can be a local
              device (path) or a host:port string to use a remote syslog.
              If empty or points to a nonexistent device, syslog logging is
              disabled.  Default is `/dev/log'.

              <b>proxy </b>URL to the proxy server that yum should use.  Set this
              to `libproxy' to enable proxy auto configuration via libproxy.
              Defaults to direct connection.

              <b>proxy_username </b>username to use for proxy

              <b>proxy_password </b>password for this proxy

              <b>username </b>username to use for basic authentication to a repo or
              really any url.

              <b>password </b>password to use with the username for basic
              authentication.

              <b>plugins </b>Either `0' or `1'. Global switch to enable or disable
              yum plugins. Default is `0' (plugins disabled). See the
              <b>PLUGINS </b>section of the <a href="../man8/yum.8.html">yum(8)</a> man for more information on
              installing yum plugins.

              <b>pluginpath </b>A list of directories where yum should look for
              plugin modules. Default is `/usr/share/yum-plugins' and
              `/usr/lib/yum-plugins'.

              <b>pluginconfpath </b>A list of directories where yum should look for
              plugin configuration files.  Default is
              `/etc/yum/pluginconf.d'.

              <b>metadata_expire </b>Time (in seconds) after which the metadata
              will expire. So that if the current metadata downloaded is
              less than this many seconds old then yum will not update the
              metadata against the repository.  If you find that yum is not
              downloading information on updates as often as you would like
              lower the value of this option. You can also change from the
              default of using seconds to using days, hours or minutes by
              appending a d, h or m respectively.  The default is 6 hours,
              to compliment yum-updatesd running once an hour.  It's also
              possible to use the word "never", meaning that the metadata
              will never expire. Note that when using a metalink file the
              metalink must always be newer than the metadata for the
              repository, due to the validation, so this timeout also
              applies to the metalink file.  Also note that "never" does not
              override "yum clean expire-cache"

              <b>metadata_expire_filter </b>Filter the metadata_expire time,
              allowing a trade of speed for accuracy if a command doesn't
              require it. Each yum command can specify that it requires a
              certain level of timeliness quality from the remote repos.
              from "I'm about to install/upgrade, so this better be current"
              to "Anything that's available is good enough".

              `never' - Nothing is filtered, always obey metadata_expire.

              `read-only:past' - Commands that only care about past
              information are filtered from metadata expiring.  Eg. yum
              history info (if history needs to lookup anything about a
              previous transaction, then by definition the remote package
              was available in the past).

              `read-only:present' - Commands that are balanced between past
              and future.  This is the default.  Eg. yum list yum

              `read-only:future' - Commands that are likely to result in
              running other commands which will require the latest metadata.
              Eg. yum check-update

              Note that this option requires that all the enabled
              repositories be roughly the same freshness (meaning the cache
              age difference from one another is at most 5 days).  Failing
              that, metadata_expire will always be obeyed, just like with
              `never'.

              Also note that this option does not override "yum clean
              expire-cache".

              <b>mirrorlist_expire </b>Time (in seconds) after which the mirrorlist
              locally cached will expire.  If the current mirrorlist is less
              than this many seconds old then yum will not download another
              copy of the mirrorlist, it has the same extra format as
              metadata_expire.  If you find that yum is not downloading the
              mirrorlists as often as you would like lower the value of this
              option.

              <b>mdpolicy </b>You can select from different metadata download
              policies depending on how much data you want to download with
              the main repository metadata index. The advantages of
              downloading more metadata with the index is that you can't get
              into situations where you need to use that metadata later and
              the versions available aren't compatible (or the user lacks
              privileges) and that if the metadata is corrupt in any way yum
              will revert to the previous metadata.

              `instant' - Just download the new metadata index, this is
              roughly what yum always did, however it now does some checking
              on the index and reverts if it classifies it as bad.

              `group:primary' - Download the primary metadata with the
              index. This contains most of the package information and so is
              almost always required anyway.

              `group:small' - With the primary also download the updateinfo
              metadata, groups, and pkgtags. This is required for yum-
              security operations and it also used in the graphical clients.
              This file also tends to be significantly smaller than most
              others. This is the default.

              `group:main' - With the primary and updateinfo download the
              filelists metadata and the group metadata. The filelists data
              is required for operations like "yum install /bin/bash", and
              also some dependency resolutions require it. The group data is
              used in some graphical clients and for group operations like
              "yum grouplist Base".

              `group:all' - Download all metadata listed in the index,
              currently the only one not listed above is the other metadata,
              which contains the changelog information which is used by yum-
              changelog. This is what "yum makecache" uses.

              <b>mddownloadpolicy </b>You can select which kinds of repodata you
              would prefer yum to download:

              `sqlite' - Download the .sqlite files, if available. This is
              currently slightly faster, once they are downloaded. However
              these files tend to be bigger, and thus. take longer to
              download.

              `xml' - Download the .XML files, which yum will do anyway as a
              fallback on the other options. These files tend to be smaller,
              but they require parsing/converting locally after download and
              some aditional checks are performed on them each time they are
              used.

              <b>multilib_policy </b>Can be set to 'all' or 'best'. All means
              install all possible arches for any package you want to
              install. Therefore yum install foo will install foo.i386 and
              foo.x86_64 on x86_64, if it is available. Best means install
              the best arch for this platform, only.

              <b>requires_policy </b>Can be set to 'strong', 'weak' or info'.
              Strong means install just the needed requirements. Weak means
              also install any weak requirements. Info means install all
              requirements. This only happens on install/reinstall,
              upgrades/downgrades do not consult this at all.  Note that yum
              will try to just drop weak and info requirements on errors.

              <b>bugtracker_url </b>URL where bugs should be filed for yum.
              Configurable for local versions or distro-specific
              bugtrackers.

              <b>color </b>Whether to display colorized output automatically,
              depending on the output terminal, can be changed to always
              (using ANSI codes) or never.  Default is `auto'.  Possible
              values are: auto, never, always.  Command-line option: <b>--color</b>

              <b>color_list_installed_older </b>The colorization/highlighting for
              packages in list/info installed which are older than the
              latest available package with the same name and arch.  Default
              is `bold'.  Possible values are a comma separated list
              containing: bold, blink, dim, reverse, underline, fg:black,
              fg:red, fg:green, fg:yellow, fg:blue, fg:magenta, fg:cyan,
              fg:white, bg:black, bg:red, bg:green, bg:yellow, bg:blue,
              bg:magenta, bg:cyan, bg:white.

              <b>color_list_installed_newer </b>The colorization/highlighting for

              recheck any requirements that existed in the old package.
              Turning this on shouldn't do anything but slow yum depsolving
              down, however using rpm --nodeps etc. can break the rpmdb and
              then this will help.  Boolean (1, 0, True, False, yes,no)
              Defaults to False

              <b>reset_nice </b>If set to true then yum will try to reset the nice
              value to zero, before running an rpm transaction. Defaults to
              True.

              <b>exit_on_lock </b>Should the yum client exit immediately when

              no) Defaults to False

              <b>loadts_ignoremissing </b>Should the load-ts command ignore

              be removed, which aren't installed, and packages in the TS to
              be added, which aren't available.  If this is set to true, and
              an rpm is missing then loadts_ignorenewrpm is automatically

              <b>loadts_ignorerpm </b>Should the load-ts command ignore the rpmdb
              version (yum version nogroups) or abort if there is a mismatch
              between the TS file and the current machine.  If this is set
              to true, then loadts_ignorenewrpm is automatically set to
              true.  Boolean (1, 0, True, False, yes, no) Defaults to False

              <b>loadts_ignorenewrpm </b>Should the load-ts command ignore the
              future rpmdb version or abort if there is a mismatch between
              the TS file and what will happen on the current machine.  Note
              that if loadts_ignorerpm is True, this option does nothing.
              Boolean (1, 0, True, False, yes, no) Defaults to False

              <b>autosavets </b>Should yum automatically save a transaction to a
              file when the transaction is solved but not run.  Boolean (1,
              0, True, False, yes, no) Defaults to True

              <b>fssnap_automatic_pre </b>Should yum try to automatically create a
              snapshot before it runs a transaction.  Boolean (1, 0, True,
              False, yes, no) Defaults to False

              <b>fssnap_automatic_post </b>Should yum try to automatically create a
              snapshot after it runs a transaction.  Boolean (1, 0, True,
              False, yes, no) Defaults to False

              <b>fssnap_automatic_keep </b>How many old snapshots should yum keep
              when trying to automatically create a new snapshot. Setting to
              0 disables this feature. Default is '1'.

              <b>fssnap_percentage </b>The size of new snaphosts, expressed as a
              percentage of the old origin device.  Any number between 1 and
              100. Default is '100'.

              <b>fssnap_devices </b>The origin LVM devices to use for snapshots.
              Wildcards and negation are allowed, first match (positive or
              negative) wins.  Default is: !*/swap !*/lv_swap
              glob:/etc/yum/fssnap.d/*.conf

              <b>fssnap_abort_on_errors </b>When fssnap_automatic_pre or
              fssnap_automatic_post is enabled, it's possible to specify
              which fssnap errors should make the transaction fail. The
              default is `any'.

              `broken-setup' - Abort current transaction if snapshot support
              is unavailable because lvm is missing or broken.

              `snapshot-failure' - Abort current transaction if creating a
              snapshot fails (e.g. there is not enough free space to make a
              snapshot).

              `any' - Abort current transaction if any of the above occurs.

              `none' - Never abort a transaction in case of errors.

              <b>depsolve_loop_limit </b>Set the number of times any attempt to
              depsolve before we just give up. This shouldn't be needed as
              yum should always solve or fail, however it has been observed
              that it can loop forever with very large system upgrades.
              Setting this to `0' (or "&lt;forever&gt;") makes yum try forever.
              Default is `100'.

              <b>usr_w_check </b>Either `0' or `1'. Set this to `0' to disable the
              checking for writability on /usr in the installroot (when
              going into the depsolving stage). Default is `1' (perform the
              check).

              <b>skip_missing_names_on_install </b>If set to False, 'yum install'
              will fail if it can't find any of the provided names (package,
              group, rpm file). Boolean (1, 0, True, False, yes, no).
              Defaults to True.

              <b>skip_missing_names_on_update </b>If set to False, 'yum update'
              will fail if it can't find any of the provided names (package,
              group, rpm file). It will also fail if the provided name is a
              package which is available, but not installed. Boolean (1, 0,
              True, False, yes, no). Defaults to True.

<h2><a id="[repository]_OPTIONS" href="#[repository]_OPTIONS"></a>[repository] OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The repository section(s) take the following form:

              <b>Example</b>: [repositoryid]
              name=Some name for this repository
              baseurl=url://path/to/repository/

              <b>repositoryid </b>Must be a unique name for each repository, one
              word.

              <b>name </b>A human readable string describing the repository.

              <b>baseurl </b>Must be a URL to the directory where the yum
              repository's `repodata' directory lives. Can be an <a href="http://">http://</a>,
              ftp:// or file:// URL. You can specify multiple URLs in one
              baseurl statement. The best way to do this is like this:
              [repositoryid]
              name=Some name for this repository
              baseurl=url://server1/path/to/repository/
                      url://server2/path/to/repository/
                      url://server3/path/to/repository/

              If you list more than one baseurl= statement in a repository
              you will find yum will ignore the earlier ones and probably
              act bizarrely. Don't do this, you've been warned.

              You can use HTTP basic auth by prepending "user:password@" to
              the server name in the baseurl line.  For example:
              "baseurl=http://user:passwd@example.com/".

              <b>metalink </b>Specifies a URL to a metalink file for the
              repomd.xml, a list of mirrors for the entire repository are
              generated by converting the mirrors for the repomd.xml file to
              a baseurl. The metalink file also contains the latest
              timestamp from the data in the repomd.xml, the length of the
              repomd.xml and checksum data. This data is checked against any
              downloaded repomd.xml file and all of the information from the
              metalink file must match. This can be used instead of or with
              the <b>baseurl </b>option. Substitution variables, described below,
              can be used with this option. This option disables the
              mirrorlist option.  As a special hack is the mirrorlist URL
              contains the word "metalink" then the value of mirrorlist is
              copied to metalink (if metalink is not set).

              <b>mirrorlist </b>Specifies a URL to a file containing a list of
              baseurls. This can be used instead of or with the <b>baseurl</b>
              option. Substitution variables, described below, can be used
              with this option.  As a special hack is the mirrorlist URL
              contains the word "metalink" then the value of mirrorlist is
              copied to metalink (if metalink is not set).

              <b>enabled </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not use
              this repository.

              <b>keepcache </b>Overrides the <b>keepcache </b>option from the [main]
              section for this repository.

              <b>gpgcheck </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not it
              should perform a GPG signature check on the packages gotten
              from this repository.

              <b>repo_gpgcheck </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not
              it should perform a GPG signature check on the repodata from
              this repository.

              <b>gpgkey </b>A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored GPG key file for
              the repository. This option is used if yum needs a public key
              to verify a package and the required key hasn't been imported
              into the RPM database. If this option is set, yum will
              automatically import the key from the specified URL. You will
              be prompted before the key is installed unless the <b>assumeyes</b>
              option is set.

              Multiple URLs may be specified here in the same manner as the
              <b>baseurl </b>option (above). If a GPG key is required to install a
              package from a repository, all keys specified for that
              repository will be installed.

              <b>gpgcakey </b>A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored CA key file for
              the repository. This is a normal gpg public key - but this key
              will be used to validate detached signatures of all other
              keys. The idea is you are asked to confirm import for this
              key. After that any other gpg key needed for package or
              repository verification, if it has a detached signature which
              matches this key will be automatically imported without user
              confirmation.

              <b>exclude </b>Same as the [main] <b>exclude </b>option but only for this
              repository.  Substitution variables, described below, are
              honored here.

              Can be disabled using --disableexcludes.

              <b>includepkgs </b>Inverse of exclude, yum will exclude any package
              in the repo. that doesn't match this list. This works in
              conjunction with exclude and doesn't override it, so if you
              exclude=*.i386 and includepkgs=python* then only packages
              starting with python that do not have an i386 arch. will be
              seen by yum in this repo.

              Substitution variables, described below, are honored here.

              Can be disabled using --disableexcludes.

              <b>enablegroups </b>Either `0' or `1'. Determines whether yum will
              allow the use of package groups for this repository. Default
              is `1' (package groups are allowed).

              <b>failovermethod </b>Either `roundrobin' or `priority'.

              `roundrobin' randomly selects a URL out of the list of URLs to
              start with and proceeds through each of them as it encounters
              a failure contacting the host.

              `priority' starts from the first baseurl listed and reads
              through them sequentially.

              <b>failovermethod </b>defaults to `roundrobin' if not specified.

              <b>keepalive </b>Either `1' or `0'. This tells yum whether or not
              HTTP/1.1 keepalive should be used with this repository. See
              the global option in the [main] section above for more
              information.

              <b>timeout </b>Overrides the <b>timeout </b>option from the [main] section
              for this repository.

              for this repository.

              <b>bandwidth </b>Overrides the <b>bandwidth </b>option from the [main]
              section for this repository.

              '_none_' to disable the global proxy setting for this
              repository. If this is unset it inherits it from the global
              setting

              <b>proxy_username </b>username to use for proxy.  If this is unset it
              inherits it from the global setting

              <b>proxy_password </b>password for this proxy.  If this is unset it
              inherits it from the global setting

              <b>username </b>username to use for basic authentication to a repo or
              really any url.  If this is unset it inherits it from the
              global setting

              <b>password </b>password to use with the username for basic
              authentication.  If this is unset it inherits it from the
              global setting

              <b>cost </b>relative cost of accessing this repository. Useful for
              weighing one repo's packages as greater/less than any other.
              defaults to 1000

              <b>skip_if_unavailable </b>If set to True yum will continue running
              if this repository cannot be contacted for any reason. This
              should be set carefully as all repos are consulted for any
              given command. Defaults to False.

              <b>async </b>If set to True Yum will download packages and metadata
              from this repo in parallel, if possible.  Defaults to True.

              <b>ui_repoid_vars </b>Overrides the <b>ui_repoid_vars </b>option from the
              [main] section for this repository.

              <b>compare_providers_priority </b>During depsolving, when choosing
              the best provider among several, yum will respect the priority
              of each provider's repository (note that there are other
              factors which yum considers, which may overweigh the
              repository priority). The value is an integer from 1 to 99, 1
              being the most preferred repository, and 99 being the least
              preferred one. By default all repositories have the priority
              of 80.

<h2><a id="URL_INCLUDE_SYNTAX" href="#URL_INCLUDE_SYNTAX"></a>URL INCLUDE SYNTAX  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The inclusion of external configuration files is supported for
       /etc/yum/yum.conf and the .repo files in the /etc/yum/repos.d
       directory. To include a URL, use a line of the following format:

       include=url://to/some/location

       The configuration file will be inserted at the position of the
       "include=" line.  Included files may contain further include lines.
       Yum will abort with an error if an inclusion loop is detected.

       Any of the configurations options which are a list of items can be
       specfied using the glob syntax: <b>glob:/etc/path/somewhere.d/*.conf</b>.
       This will read in all files matching that glob and include all lines
       in each file (excluding comments and blank lines) as items in the
       list.
</pre>
<h2><a id="VARIABLES" href="#VARIABLES"></a>VARIABLES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There are a number of variables you can use to ease maintenance of
       yum's configuration files. They are available in the values of
       several options including <b>name</b>, <b>baseurl </b>and <b>commands.</b>

              <b>$releasever </b>This will be replaced with the value of the
              version of the package listed in <b>distroverpkg</b>. This defaults
              to the version of `redhat-release' package.

              <b>$arch </b>This will be replaced with the architecture or your
              system as detected by yum.

              <b>$basearch </b>This will be replaced with your base architecture in
              yum. For example, if your $arch is i686 your $basearch will be
              i386.

              <b>$uuid </b>This will be replaced with a unique but persistent uuid
              for this machine.  The value that is first generated will be
              stored in /var/lib/yum/uuid and reused until this file is
              deleted.

              <b>$YUM0-$YUM9 </b>These will be replaced with the value of the shell
              environment variable of the same name. If the shell
              environment variable does not exist then the configuration
              file variable will not be replaced.

       As of 3.2.28, any properly named file in /etc/yum/vars is turned into
       a variable named after the filename (or overrides any of the above
       variables).  Filenames may contain only alphanumeric characters and
       underscores and be in lowercase.

       Note that no warnings/errors are given if the files are unreadable,
       so creating files that only root can read may be confusing for users.

       Also note that only the first line will be read and all new line
       characters are removed, as a convenience. However, no other checking
       is performed on the data. This means it is possible to have bad
       character data in any value.
