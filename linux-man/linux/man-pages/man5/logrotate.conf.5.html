       <b>logrotate </b>is designed to ease administration of systems that generate
       large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation,
       compression, removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be
       handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

       Normally, <b>logrotate </b>is run as a daily cron job.  It will not modify a
       log more than once in one day unless the criterion for that log is
       based on the log's size and <b>logrotate </b>is being run more than once
       each day, or unless the <b>-f </b>or <b>--force </b>option is used.

       Any number of config files may be given on the command line. Later
       config files may override the options given in earlier files, so the
       order in which the <b>logrotate </b>config files are listed is important.
       Normally, a single config file which includes any other config files
       which are needed should be used.  See below for more information on
       how to use the <b>include </b>directive to accomplish this.  If a directory
       is given on the command line, every file in that directory is used as
       a config file.

       If no command line arguments are given, <b>logrotate </b>will print version
       and copyright information, along with a short usage summary.  If any
       errors occur while rotating logs, <b>logrotate </b>will exit with non-zero
       status.
</pre>
<h2><a id="OPTIONS" href="#OPTIONS"></a>OPTIONS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Prints help message.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Turns on debug mode and implies <b>-v</b>.  In debug mode, no changes
              will be made to the logs or to the <b>logrotate </b>state file.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Tells <b>logrotate </b>to force the rotation, even if it doesn't
              think this is necessary.  Sometimes this is useful after
              adding new entries to a <b>logrotate </b>config file, or if old log
              files have been removed by hand, as the new files will be
              created, and logging will continue correctly.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--log </b><i>file</i>
              Tells <b>logrotate </b>to log verbose output into the log_file. The
              verbose output logged to that file is the same as when running
              <b>logrotate </b>with <b>-v </b>switch. The log file is overwritten on every
              logrotate execution.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mail </b><i>command</i>
              Tells <b>logrotate </b>which command to use when mailing logs. This
              command should accept two arguments:

              1) the subject of the message
              2) the recipient.

              The command must then read a message on standard input and
              mail it to the recipient. The default mail command is
              <i>/bin/mail</i>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--state </b><i>statefile</i>
              Tells <b>logrotate </b>to use an alternate state file.  This is
              useful if logrotate is being run as a different user for
              various sets of log files.  The default state file is
              <i>/var/lib/logrotate.status</i>.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Prints a short usage message.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Turns on verbose mode, for example to display messages during
              rotation.

<h2><a id="CONFIGURATION_FILE" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE"></a>CONFIGURATION FILE  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       <b>logrotate </b>reads everything about the log files it should be handling
       from the series of configuration files specified on the command line.
       Each configuration file can set global options (local definitions
       override global ones, and later definitions override earlier ones)
       and specify logfiles to rotate. A simple configuration file looks
       like this:

       # sample logrotate configuration file
       compress

       /var/log/messages {
           rotate 5
           weekly
           postrotate
               /usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd
           endscript
       }

       "/var/log/httpd/access.log" /var/log/httpd/error.log {
           rotate 5
           mail recipient@example.org
           size 100k
           sharedscripts
           postrotate
               /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpd
           endscript
       }

       /var/log/news/* {
           monthly
           rotate 2
           olddir /var/log/news/old
           missingok
           postrotate
               kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/inn.pid)
           endscript
           nocompress
       }

       ~/log/*.log {}

       The first few lines set global options; in the example, logs are
       compressed after they are rotated.  Note that comments may appear
       anywhere in the config file as long as the first non-whitespace
       character on the line is a <b>#</b>.

       Values are separated from directives by whitespace and/or an optional
       =.  Numbers must be specified in a format understood by <a href="../man3/strtoul.3.html">strtoul(3)</a>.

       The next section of the config file defines how to handle the log
       file <i>/var/log/messages</i>. The log will go through five weekly rotations
       before being removed. After the log file has been rotated (but before
       the old version of the log has been compressed), the command
       <i>/usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd</i> will be executed.

       The next section defines the parameters for both
       <i>/var/log/httpd/access.log</i> and <i>/var/log/httpd/error.log</i>.  Each is
       rotated whenever it grows over 100k in size, and the old logs files
       are mailed (uncompressed) to recipient@example.org after going
       through 5 rotations, rather than being removed. The <b>sharedscripts</b>
       means that the <b>postrotate </b>script will only be run once (after the old
       logs have been compressed), not once for each log which is rotated.
       Note that log file names may be enclosed in quotes (and that quotes
       are required if the name contains spaces).  Normal shell quoting
       rules apply, with <b>'</b>, <b>"</b>, and <b>\ </b>characters supported.

       The next section defines the parameters for all of the files in
       <i>/var/log/news</i>. Each file is rotated on a monthly basis.  This is
       considered a single rotation directive and if errors occur for more
       than one file, the log files are not compressed.

       The last section uses tilde expansion to rotate log files in the home
       directory of the current user. This is only available, if your glob
       library supports tilde expansion. GNU glob does support this.

       Please use wildcards with caution.  If you specify *, <b>logrotate </b>will
       rotate all files, including previously rotated ones.  A way around
       this is to use the <b>olddir </b>directive or a more exact wildcard (such as
       *.log).

       Here is more information on the directives which may be included in a
       <b>logrotate </b>configuration file:

   <b>DIRECTIVES</b>
       These directives may be included in a <b>logrotate </b>configuration file:

       <b>compress</b>
              Old versions of log files are compressed with <b>gzip</b>(1) by
              default. See also <b>nocompress</b>.

       <b>compresscmd</b>
              Specifies which command to use to compress log files.  The
              default is <b>gzip</b>(1).  See also <b>compress</b>.

       <b>uncompresscmd</b>
              Specifies which command to use to uncompress log files.  The
              default is <b>gunzip</b>(1).

       <b>compressext</b>
              Specifies which extension to use on compressed logfiles, if
              compression is enabled.  The default follows that of the
              configured compression command.

       <b>compressoptions</b>
              Command line options may be passed to the compression program,
              if one is in use.  The default, for <b>gzip</b>(1), is "-6" (biased
              towards high compression at the expense of speed).  If you use
              a different compression command, you may need to change the
              <b>compressoptions </b>to match.

       <b>copy   </b>Make a copy of the log file, but don't change the original at
              all.  This option can be used, for instance, to make a
              snapshot of the current log file, or when some other utility
              needs to truncate or parse the file.  When this option is
              used, the <b>create </b>option will have no effect, as the old log
              file stays in place.

       <b>copytruncate</b>
              Truncate the original log file to zero size in place after
              creating a copy, instead of moving the old log file and
              optionally creating a new one.  It can be used when some
              program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might
              continue writing (appending) to the previous log file forever.
              Note that there is a very small time slice between copying the
              file and truncating it, so some logging data might be lost.
              When this option is used, the <b>create </b>option will have no
              effect, as the old log file stays in place.

       <b>create </b><i>mode owner group</i>, <b>create </b><i>owner group</i>
              Immediately after rotation (before the <b>postrotate </b>script is
              run) the log file is created (with the same name as the log
              file just rotated).  <i>mode</i> specifies the mode for the log file
              in octal (the same as <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</a>), <i>owner</i> specifies the user name
              who will own the log file, and <i>group</i> specifies the group the
              log file will belong to. Any of the log file attributes may be
              omitted, in which case those attributes for the new file will
              use the same values as the original log file for the omitted
              attributes. This option can be disabled using the <b>nocreate</b>
              option.

       <b>createolddir </b><i>mode owner group</i>
              If the directory specified by <b>olddir </b>directive does not exist,
              it is created. <i>mode</i> specifies the mode for the <b>olddir</b>
              directory in octal (the same as <a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</a>), <i>owner</i> specifies the
              user name who will own the <b>olddir </b>directory, and <i>group</i>
              specifies the group the <b>olddir </b>directory will belong to. This
              option can be disabled using the <b>nocreateolddir </b>option.

       <b>daily  </b>Log files are rotated every day.

       <b>dateext</b>
              Archive old versions of log files adding a date extension like
              YYYYMMDD instead of simply adding a number. The extension may
              be configured using the <b>dateformat </b>and <b>dateyesterday </b>options.

       <b>dateformat </b><i>format_string</i>
              Specify the extension for <b>dateext </b>using the notation similar
              to <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> function. Only %Y %m %d %H %M %S %V and %s
              specifiers are allowed.  The default value is -%Y%m%d except
              hourly, which uses -%Y%m%d%H as default value.  Note that also
              the character separating log name from the extension is part
              of the dateformat string. The system clock must be set past
              Sep 9th 2001 for %s to work correctly.  Note that the
              datestamps generated by this format must be lexically sortable
              (that is first the year, then the month then the day. For
              example 2001/12/01 is ok, but 01/12/2001 is not, since
              01/11/2002 would sort lower while it is later).  This is
              because when using the <b>rotate </b>option, logrotate sorts all
              rotated filenames to find out which logfiles are older and
              should be removed.

       <b>dateyesterday</b>
              Use yesterday's instead of today's date to create the <b>dateext</b>
              extension, so that the rotated log file has a date in its name
              that is the same as the timestamps within it.

       <b>delaycompress</b>
              Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next
              rotation cycle.  This only has effect when used in combination
              with <b>compress</b>.  It can be used when some program cannot be
              told to close its logfile and thus might continue writing to
              the previous log file for some time.

       <b>extension </b><i>ext</i>
              Log files with <i>ext</i> extension can keep it after the rotation.
              If compression  is  used,  the compression extension (normally
              <i>.gz</i>) appears after <i>ext</i>. For example you have a logfile named
              mylog.foo and want to rotate it to mylog.1.foo.gz instead of
              mylog.foo.1.gz.

       <b>hourly </b>Log files are rotated every hour. Note that usually <i>logrotate</i>
              is configured to be run by cron daily. You have to change this
              configuration and run <i>logrotate</i> hourly to be able to really
              rotate logs hourly.

       <b>addextension </b><i>ext</i>
              Log files are given the final extension <i>ext</i> after rotation. If
              the original file already ends with <i>ext</i>, the extension is not
              duplicated, but merely moved to the end, that is both <b>filename</b>
              and <b>filename</b><i>ext</i> would get rotated to filename.1<i>ext</i>. If
              compression is used, the compression extension (normally <b>.gz</b>)
              appears after <i>ext</i>.

       <b>ifempty</b>
              Rotate the log file even if it is empty, overriding the
              <b>notifempty </b>option (<b>ifempty </b>is the default).

       <b>include </b><i>file_or_directory</i>
              Reads the file given as an argument as if it was included
              inline where the <b>include </b>directive appears. If a directory is
              given, most of the files in that directory are read in
              alphabetic order before processing of the including file
              continues. The only files which are ignored are files which
              are not regular files (such as directories and named pipes)
              and files whose names end with one of the taboo extensions or
              patterns, as specified by the <b>tabooext </b>or <b>taboopat </b>directives,
              respectively.

       <b>mail </b><i>address</i>
              When a log is rotated out of existence, it is mailed to
              <i>address</i>. If no mail should be generated by a particular log,
              the <b>nomail </b>directive may be used.

       <b>mailfirst</b>
              When using the <b>mail </b>command, mail the just-rotated file,
              instead of the about-to-expire file.

       <b>maillast</b>
              When using the <b>mail </b>command, mail the about-to-expire file,
              instead of the just-rotated file (this is the default).

       <b>minage </b><i>count</i>
              Do not rotate logs which are less than &lt;count&gt; days old.

       <b>maxage </b><i>count</i>
              Remove rotated logs older than &lt;count&gt; days. The age is only
              checked if the logfile is to be rotated. The files are mailed
              to the configured address if <b>maillast </b>and <b>mail </b>are configured.

       <b>maxsize </b><i>size</i>
              Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than <i>size</i> bytes
              even before the additionally specified time interval (<b>daily</b>,
              <b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>).  The related <b>size </b>option is
              similar except that it is mutually exclusive with the time
              interval options, and it causes log files to be rotated
              without regard for the last rotation time.  When <b>maxsize </b>is
              used, both the size and timestamp of a log file are
              considered.

       <b>minsize  </b><i>size</i>
              Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than <i>size</i> bytes,
              but not before the additionally specified time interval
              (<b>daily</b>, <b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>).  The related <b>size </b>option
              is similar except that it is mutually exclusive with the time
              interval options, and it causes log files to be rotated
              without regard for the last rotation time.  When <b>minsize </b>is
              used, both the size and timestamp of a log file are
              considered.

       <b>missingok</b>
              If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without
              issuing an error message. See also <b>nomissingok</b>.

       <b>monthly</b>
              Log files are rotated the first time <b>logrotate </b>is run in a
              month (this is normally on the first day of the month).

       <b>nocompress</b>
              Old versions of log files are not compressed. See also
              <b>compress</b>.

       <b>nocopy </b>Do not copy the original log file and leave it in place.
              (this overrides the <b>copy </b>option).

       <b>nocopytruncate</b>
              Do not truncate the original log file in place after creating
              a copy (this overrides the <b>copytruncate </b>option).

       <b>nocreate</b>
              New log files are not created (this overrides the <b>create</b>
              option).

       <b>nocreateolddir</b>
              <b>olddir </b>directory is not created by logrotate when it does not
              exist.

       <b>nodelaycompress</b>
              Do not postpone compression of the previous log file to the
              next rotation cycle (this overrides the <b>delaycompress </b>option).

       <b>nodateext</b>
              Do not archive  old versions of log files with date extension
              (this overrides the <b>dateext </b>option).

       <b>nomail </b>Do not mail old log files to any address.

       <b>nomissingok</b>
              If a log file does not exist, issue an error. This is the
              default.

       <b>noolddir</b>
              Logs are rotated in the directory they normally reside in
              (this overrides the <b>olddir </b>option).

       <b>nosharedscripts</b>
              Run <b>prerotate </b>and <b>postrotate </b>scripts for every log file which
              is rotated (this is the default, and overrides the
              <b>sharedscripts </b>option). The absolute path to the log file is
              passed as first argument to the script. If the scripts exit
              with error, the remaining actions will not be executed for the
              affected log only.

       <b>noshred</b>
              Do not use <b>shred </b>when deleting old log files. See also <b>shred</b>.

       <b>notifempty</b>
              Do not rotate the log if it is empty (this overrides the
              <b>ifempty </b>option).

       <b>olddir </b><i>directory</i>
              Logs are moved into <i>directory</i> for rotation. The <i>directory</i> must
              be on the same physical device as the log file being rotated,
              unless <b>copy</b>, <b>copytruncate </b>or <b>renamecopy </b>option is used. The
              <i>directory</i> is assumed to be relative to the directory holding
              the log file unless an absolute path name is specified. When
              this option is used all old versions of the log end up in
              <i>directory</i>.  This option may be overridden by the <b>noolddir</b>
              option.

       <b>postrotate</b>/<b>endscript</b>
              The lines between <b>postrotate </b>and <b>endscript </b>(both of which must
              appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using <b>/bin/sh</b>)
              after the log file is rotated. These directives may only
              appear inside a log file definition. Normally, the absolute
              path to the log file is passed as first argument to the
              script. If <b>sharedscripts </b>is specified, whole pattern is passed
              to the script.  See also <b>prerotate</b>. See <b>sharedscripts </b>and
              <b>nosharedscripts </b>for error handling.

       <b>prerotate</b>/<b>endscript</b>
              The lines between <b>prerotate </b>and <b>endscript </b>(both of which must
              appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using <b>/bin/sh</b>)
              before the log file is rotated and only if the log will
              actually be rotated. These directives may only appear inside a
              log file definition. Normally, the absolute path to the log
              file is passed as first argument to the script.  If
              <b>sharedscripts </b>is specified, whole pattern is passed to the
              script.  See also <b>postrotate</b>.  See <b>sharedscripts </b>and
              <b>nosharedscripts </b>for error handling.

       <b>firstaction</b>/<b>endscript</b>
              The lines between <b>firstaction </b>and <b>endscript </b>(both of which
              must appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
              <b>/bin/sh</b>) once before all log files that match the wildcarded
              pattern are rotated, before prerotate script is run and only
              if at least one log will actually be rotated.  These
              directives may only appear inside a log file definition. Whole
              pattern is passed to the script as first argument. If the
              script exits with error, no further processing is done. See
              also <b>lastaction</b>.

       <b>lastaction</b>/<b>endscript</b>
              The lines between <b>lastaction </b>and <b>endscript </b>(both of which must
              appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using <b>/bin/sh</b>)
              once after all log files that match the wildcarded pattern are
              rotated, after postrotate script is run and only if at least
              one log is rotated. These directives may only appear inside a
              log file definition. Whole pattern is passed to the script as
              first argument. If the script exits with error, just an error
              message is shown (as this is the last action). See also
              <b>firstaction</b>.

       <b>preremove</b>/<b>endscript</b>
              The lines between <b>preremove </b>and <b>endscript </b>(both of which must
              appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using <b>/bin/sh</b>)
              once just before removal of a log file.  The logrotate will
              pass the name of file which is soon to be removed. See also
              <b>firstaction</b>.

       <b>rotate </b><i>count</i>
              Log files are rotated <i>count</i> times before being removed or
              mailed to the address specified in a <b>mail </b>directive. If <i>count</i>
              is 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated. Default is
              0.

       <b>renamecopy</b>
              Log file is renamed to temporary filename in the same
              directory by adding ".tmp" extension to it. After that,
              <b>postrotate </b>script is run and log file is copied from temporary
              filename to final filename. This allows storing rotated log
              files on the different devices using <b>olddir </b>directive. In the
              end, temporary filename is removed.

       <b>size </b><i>size</i>
              Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than <i>size</i>
              bytes. If <i>size</i> is followed by <i>k</i>, the size is assumed to be in
              kilobytes.  If the <i>M</i> is used, the size is in megabytes, and if
              <i>G</i> is used, the size is in gigabytes. So <i>size 100</i>, <i>size 100k</i>,
              <i>size 100M</i> and <i>size 100G</i> are all valid.

       <b>sharedscripts</b>
              Normally, <b>prerotate </b>and <b>postrotate </b>scripts are run for each
              log which is rotated and the absolute path to the log file is
              passed as first argument to the script. That means a single
              script may be run multiple times for log file entries which
              match multiple files (such as the <i>/var/log/news/*</i> example). If
              <b>sharedscripts </b>is specified, the scripts are only run once, no
              matter how many logs match the wildcarded pattern, and whole
              pattern is passed to them.  However, if none of the logs in
              the pattern require rotating, the scripts will not be run at
              all. If the scripts exit with error, the remaining actions
              will not be executed for any logs. This option overrides the
              <b>nosharedscripts </b>option and implies <b>create </b>option.

       <b>shred  </b>Delete log files using <b>shred </b>-u instead of unlink().  This
              should ensure that logs are not readable after their scheduled
              deletion; this is off by default.  See also <b>noshred</b>.

       <b>shredcycles </b><i>count</i>
              Asks GNU <a href="../man1/shred.1.html">shred(1)</a> to overwrite log files <b>count </b>times before
              deletion.  Without this option, <b>shred</b>'s default will be used.

       <b>start </b><i>count</i>
              This is the number to use as the base for rotation. For
              example, if you specify 0, the logs will be created with a .0
              extension as they are rotated from the original log files.  If
              you specify 9, log files will be created with a .9, skipping
              0-8.  Files will still be rotated the number of times
              specified with the <b>rotate </b>directive.

       <b>su </b><i>user group</i>
              Rotate log files set under this user and group instead of
              using default user/group (usually root). <i>user</i> specifies the
              user name used for rotation and <i>group</i> specifies the group used
              for rotation. If the user/group you specify here does not have
              sufficient privilege to make files with the ownership you've
              specified in a <i>create</i> instruction, it will cause an error.

       <b>tabooext </b>[+] <i>list</i>
              The current taboo extension list is changed (see the <b>include</b>
              directive for information on the taboo extensions). If a +
              precedes the list of extensions, the current taboo extension
              list is augmented, otherwise it is replaced. At startup, the
              taboo extension list <i>,v</i>, <i>.cfsaved</i>, <i>.disabled</i>, <i>.dpkg-dist</i>,
              <i>.dpkg-new</i>, <i>.dpkg-old</i>, <i>.rhn-cfg-tmp-*</i>, <i>.rpmnew</i>, <i>.rpmorig</i>,
              <i>.rpmsave</i>, <i>.swp</i>, <i>.ucf-dist</i>, <i>.ucf-new</i>, <i>.ucf-old</i>, <i>~</i>

       <b>taboopat </b>[+] <i>list</i>
              The current taboo glob pattern list is changed (see the
              <b>include </b>directive for information on the taboo extensions and
              patterns). If a + precedes the list of patterns, the current
              taboo pattern list is augmented, otherwise it is replaced. At
              startup, the taboo pattern list is empty.

       <b>weekly </b>[<i>weekday</i>]
              Log files are rotated once each <i>weekday</i>, or if the date is
              advanced by at least 7 days since the last rotation (while
              ignoring the exact time).  The <i>weekday</i> intepretation is
              following:  0 means Sunday, 1 means Monday, ..., 6 means
              Saturday; the special value 7 means each 7 days,
              irrespectively of weekday.  Defaults to 0 if the <i>weekday</i>
              argument is omitted.

       <b>yearly </b>Log files are rotated if the current year is not the same as
              the last rotation.
