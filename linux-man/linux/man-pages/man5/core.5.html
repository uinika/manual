       core - core dump file
</pre>
<h2><a id="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       The default action of certain signals is to cause a process to
       terminate and produce a <i>core dump file</i>, a disk file containing an
       image of the process's memory at the time of termination.  This image
       can be used in a debugger (e.g., <a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a>) to inspect the state of the
       program at the time that it terminated.  A list of the signals which
       cause a process to dump core can be found in <a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>.

       A process can set its soft <b>RLIMIT_CORE </b>resource limit to place an
       upper limit on the size of the core dump file that will be produced
       if it receives a "core dump" signal; see <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a> for details.

       There are various circumstances in which a core dump file is not
       produced:

       *  The process does not have permission to write the core file.  (By
          default, the core file is called <i>core</i> or <i>core.pid</i>, where <i>pid</i> is
          the ID of the process that dumped core, and is created in the
          current working directory.  See below for details on naming.)
          Writing the core file will fail if the directory in which it is to
          be created is nonwritable, or if a file with the same name exists
          and is not writable or is not a regular file (e.g., it is a
          directory or a symbolic link).

       *  A (writable, regular) file with the same name as would be used for
          the core dump already exists, but there is more than one hard link
          to that file.

       *  The filesystem where the core dump file would be created is full;
          or has run out of inodes; or is mounted read-only; or the user has
          reached their quota for the filesystem.

       *  The directory in which the core dump file is to be created does
          not exist.

       *  The <b>RLIMIT_CORE </b>(core file size) or <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE </b>(file size)
          resource limits for the process are set to zero; see <a href="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>
          and the documentation of the shell's <i>ulimit</i> command (<i>limit</i> in
          <b>csh</b>(1)).

       *  The binary being executed by the process does not have read
          permission enabled.

       *  The process is executing a set-user-ID (set-group-ID) program that
          is owned by a user (group) other than the real user (group) ID of
          the process, or the process is executing a program that has file
          capabilities (see <a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).  (However, see the description
          of the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>operation, and the description of
          the <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> file in <a href="proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.)

       *  (Since Linux 3.7) The kernel was configured without the
          <b>CONFIG_COREDUMP </b>option.

       In addition, a core dump may exclude part of the address space of the
       process if the <a href="../man2/madvise.2.html">madvise(2)</a> <b>MADV_DONTDUMP </b>flag was employed.

   <b>Naming of core dump files</b>
       By default, a core dump file is named <i>core</i>, but the
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> file (since Linux 2.6 and 2.4.21) can
       be set to define a template that is used to name core dump files.
       The template can contain % specifiers which are substituted by the
       following values when a core file is created:

           %%  a single % character
           %c  core file size soft resource limit of crashing process (since
               Linux 2.6.24)
           %d  dump modeâ€”same as value returned by <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</b>
               (since Linux 3.7)
           %e  executable filename (without path prefix)
           %E  pathname of executable, with slashes ('/') replaced by
               exclamation marks ('!') (since Linux 3.0).
           %g  (numeric) real GID of dumped process
           %h  hostname (same as <i>nodename</i> returned by <a href="../man2/uname.2.html">uname(2)</a>)
           %i  TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the PID
               namespace in which the thread resides (since Linux 3.18)
           %I  TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the
               initial PID namespace (since Linux 3.18)
           %p  PID of dumped process, as seen in the PID namespace in which
               the process resides
           %P  PID of dumped process, as seen in the initial PID namespace
               (since Linux 3.12)
           %s  number of signal causing dump
           %t  time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch,
               1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)
           %u  (numeric) real UID of dumped process

       A single % at the end of the template is dropped from the core
       filename, as is the combination of a % followed by any character
       other than those listed above.  All other characters in the template
       become a literal part of the core filename.  The template may include
       '/' characters, which are interpreted as delimiters for directory
       names.  The maximum size of the resulting core filename is 128 bytes
       (64 bytes in kernels before 2.6.19).  The default value in this file
       is "core".  For backward compatibility, if
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> does not include <i>%p</i> and
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> (see below) is nonzero, then .PID will
       be appended to the core filename.

       Paths are interpreted according to the settings that are active for
       the crashing process.  That means the crashing process's mount
       namespace (see <a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>), its current working directory
       (found via <a href="../man2/getcwd.2.html">getcwd(2)</a>), and its root directory (see <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a>).

       Since version 2.4, Linux has also provided a more primitive method of
       controlling the name of the core dump file.  If the
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> file contains the value 0, then a core
       dump file is simply named <i>core</i>.  If this file contains a nonzero
       value, then the core dump file includes the process ID in a name of
       the form <i>core.PID</i>.

       Since Linux 3.6, if <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> is set to 2
       ("suidsafe"), the pattern must be either an absolute pathname
       (starting with a leading '/' character) or a pipe, as defined below.

   <b>Piping core dumps to a program</b>
       Since kernel 2.6.19, Linux supports an alternate syntax for the
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> file.  If the first character of this
       file is a pipe symbol (<b>|</b>), then the remainder of the line is
       interpreted as the command-line for a user-space program (or script)
       that is to be executed.  Instead of being written to a disk file, the
       core dump is given as standard input to the program.  Note the
       following points:

       *  The program must be specified using an absolute pathname (or a
          pathname relative to the root directory, <i>/</i>), and must immediately
          follow the '|' character.

       *  The command-line arguments can include any of the % specifiers
          listed above.  For example, to pass the PID of the process that is
          being dumped, specify <i>%p</i> in an argument.

       *  The process created to run the program runs as user and group
          <i>root</i>.

       *  Running as <i>root</i> does not confer any exceptional security bypasses.
          Namely, LSMs (e.g., SELinux) are still active and may prevent the
          handler from accessing details about the crashed process via
          <i>/proc/[pid]</i>.

       *  The program pathname is interpreted with respect to the initial
          mount namespace as it is always executed there.  It is not
          affected by the settings (e.g., root directory, mount namespace,
          current working directory) of the crashing process.

       *  The process runs in the initial namespaces (PID, mount, user, and
          so on) and not in the namespaces of the crashing process.  One can
          utilize specifiers such as <i>%P</i> to find the right <i>/proc/[pid]</i>
          directory and probe/enter the crashing process's namespaces if
          needed.

       *  The process starts with its current working directory as the root
          directory.  If desired, it is possible change to the working
          directory of the dumping process by employing the value provided
          by the <i>%P</i> specifier to change to the location of the dumping
          process via <i>/proc/[pid]/cwd</i>.

       *  Command-line arguments can be supplied to the program (since Linux
          2.6.24), delimited by white space (up to a total line length of
          128 bytes).

   <b>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</b>
       When collecting core dumps via a pipe to a user-space program, it can
       be useful for the collecting program to gather data about the
       crashing process from that process's <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directory.  In order
       to do this safely, the kernel must wait for the program collecting
       the core dump to exit, so as not to remove the crashing process's
       <i>/proc/[pid]</i> files prematurely.  This in turn creates the possibility
       that a misbehaving collecting program can block the reaping of a
       crashed process by simply never exiting.

       Since Linux 2.6.32, the <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</i> can be used
       to defend against this possibility.  The value in this file defines
       how many concurrent crashing processes may be piped to user-space
       programs in parallel.  If this value is exceeded, then those crashing
       processes above this value are noted in the kernel log and their core
       dumps are skipped.

       A value of 0 in this file is special.  It indicates that unlimited
       processes may be captured in parallel, but that no waiting will take
       place (i.e., the collecting program is not guaranteed access to
       <i>/proc/&lt;crashing-PID&gt;</i>).  The default value for this file is 0.

   <b>Controlling which mappings are written to the core dump</b>
       Since kernel 2.6.23, the Linux-specific <i>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</i>
       file can be used to control which memory segments are written to the
       core dump file in the event that a core dump is performed for the
       process with the corresponding process ID.

       The value in the file is a bit mask of memory mapping types (see
       <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>).  If a bit is set in the mask, then memory mappings of the
       corresponding type are dumped; otherwise they are not dumped.  The
       bits in this file have the following meanings:

           bit 0  Dump anonymous private mappings.
           bit 1  Dump anonymous shared mappings.
           bit 2  Dump file-backed private mappings.
           bit 3  Dump file-backed shared mappings.
           bit 4 (since Linux 2.6.24)
                  Dump ELF headers.
           bit 5 (since Linux 2.6.28)
                  Dump private huge pages.
           bit 6 (since Linux 2.6.28)
                  Dump shared huge pages.
           bit 7 (since Linux 4.4)
                  Dump private DAX pages.
           bit 8 (since Linux 4.4)
                  Dump shared DAX pages.

       By default, the following bits are set: 0, 1, 4 (if the
       <b>CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS </b>kernel configuration option is
       enabled), and 5.  This default can be modified at boot time using the
       <i>coredump_filter</i> boot option.

       The value of this file is displayed in hexadecimal.  (The default
       value is thus displayed as 33.)

       Memory-mapped I/O pages such as frame buffer are never dumped, and
       virtual DSO pages are always dumped, regardless of the
       <i>coredump_filter</i> value.

       A child process created via <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits its parent's
       <i>coredump_filter</i> value; the <i>coredump_filter</i> value is preserved across
       an <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       It can be useful to set <i>coredump_filter</i> in the parent shell before
       running a program, for example:

           $ <b>echo 0x7 &gt; /proc/self/coredump_filter</b>
           $ <b>./some_program</b>

       This file is provided only if the kernel was built with the
       <b>CONFIG_ELF_CORE </b>configuration option.

       The <a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a> <i>gcore</i> command can be used to obtain a core dump of a
       running process.

       In Linux versions up to and including 2.6.27, if a multithreaded
       process (or, more precisely, a process that shares its memory with
       another process by being created with the <b>CLONE_VM </b>flag of <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>)
       dumps core, then the process ID is always appended to the core
       filename, unless the process ID was already included elsewhere in the
       filename via a <i>%p</i> specification in <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i>.
       (This is primarily useful when employing the obsolete LinuxThreads
       implementation, where each thread of a process has a different PID.)
