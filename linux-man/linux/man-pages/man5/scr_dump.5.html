       The curses library provides applications with the ability to write
       the contents of a window to an external file using <b>scr_dump </b>or
       <b>putwin</b>, and read it back using <b>scr_restore </b>or <b>getwin</b>.

       The <b>putwin </b>and <b>getwin </b>functions do the work; while <b>scr_dump </b>and
       <b>scr_restore </b>conveniently save and restore the whole screen, i.e.,
       <b>stdscr</b>.

   <b>ncurses6</b>
       A longstanding implementation of screen-dump was revised with
       ncurses6 to remedy problems with the earlier approach:

       ·   A “magic number” is written to the beginning of the dump file,
           allowing applications (such as <a href="../man1/file.1.html">file(1)</a>) to recognize curses dump
           files.

           Because ncurses6 uses a new format, that requires a new magic
           number was unused by other applications.  This 16-bit number was
           unused:

             0x8888 (octal “\210\210”)

           but to be more certain, this 32-bit number was chosen:

             0x88888888 (octal “\210\210\210\210”)

           This is the pattern submitted to the maintainers of the <b>file</b>
           program:

             #
             # ncurses5 (and before) did not use a magic number,
             # making screen dumps "data".
             #
             # ncurses6 (2015) uses this format, ignoring byte-order
             0    string    \210\210\210\210ncurses    ncurses6 screen image
             #

       ·   The screen dumps are written in textual form, so that internal
           data sizes are not directly related to the dump-format, and
           enabling the library to read dumps from either narrow- or wide-
           character- configurations.

           The <i>narrow</i> library configuration holds characters and video
           attributes in a 32-bit <b>chtype</b>, while the <i>wide-character</i> library
           stores this information in the <b>cchar_t </b>structure, which is much
           larger than 32-bits.

       ·   It is possible to read a screen dump into a terminal with a
           different screen-size, because the library truncates or fills the
           screen as necessary.

       ·   The ncurses6 <b>getwin </b>reads the legacy screen dumps from ncurses5.

   <b>ncurses5 (legacy)</b>
       The screen-dump feature was added to ncurses in June 1995.  While
       there were fixes and improvements in succeeding years, the basic
       scheme was unchanged:

       ·   The <b>WINDOW </b>structure was written in binary form.

       ·   The <b>WINDOW </b>structure refers to lines of data, which were written
           as an array of binary data following the <b>WINDOW</b>.

       ·   When <b>getwin </b>restored the window, it would keep track of offsets
           into the array of line-data and adjust the <b>WINDOW </b>structure which
           was read back into memory.

       This is similar to Unix SystemV, but does not write a “magic number”
       to identify the file format.

<h2><a id="PORTABILITY" href="#PORTABILITY"></a>PORTABILITY  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#top_of_page"><span class="top-link">top</span></a></h2><pre>
       There is no standard format for <b>putwin</b>.  This section gives a brief
       description of the existing formats.

   <b>X/Open Curses</b>
       Refer to <i>X/Open Curses, Issue 7</i> (2009).

       X/Open's documentation for <i>enhanced curses</i> says only:

          The <i>getwin( )</i> function reads window-related data stored in the
          file by <i>putwin( )</i>.  The function then creates and initializes a
          new window using that data.

          The <i>putwin( )</i> function writes all data associated with <i>win</i> into
          the <i>stdio</i> stream to which <i>filep</i> points, using an <b>unspecified</b>
          <b>format</b>.  This information can be retrieved later using <i>getwin( )</i>.

       In the mid-1990s when the X/Open Curses document was written, there
       were still systems using older, less capable curses libraries (aside
       from the BSD curses library which was not relevant to X/Open because
       it did not meet the criteria for <i>base curses</i>).  The document
       explained the term “enhanced” as follows:

          ·   Shading is used to identify <i>X/Open Enhanced Curses</i> material,
              relating to interfaces included to provide enhanced
              capabilities for applications originally written to be
              compiled on systems based on the UNIX operating system.
              Therefore, the features described may not be present on
              systems that conform to <b>XPG4 or to earlier XPG releases</b>.  The
              relevant reference pages may provide additional or more
              specific portability warnings about use of the material.

       In the foregoing, emphasis was added to <b>unspecified format </b>and to
       <b>XPG4 or to earlier XPG releases</b>, for clarity.

   <b>Unix SystemV</b>
       Unix SystemV curses identified the file format by writing a “magic
       number” at the beginning of the dump.  The <b>WINDOW </b>data and the lines
       of text follow, all in binary form.

       The Solaris curses source has these definitions:

         /* terminfo magic number */
         #define MAGNUM  0432

         /* curses screen dump magic number */
         #define SVR2_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0433
         #define SVR3_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0434

       That is, the feature was likely introduced in SVr2 (1984), and
       improved in SVr3 (1987).  The Solaris curses source has no magic
       number for SVr4 (1989).  Other operating systems (AIX and HPUX) use a
       magic number which would correspond to this definition:

         /* curses screen dump magic number */
         #define SVR4_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0435

       That octal number in bytes is 001, 035.  Because most Unix vendors
       use big-endian hardware, the magic number is written with the high-
       order byte first, e.g.,

          01 35

       After the magic number, the <b>WINDOW </b>structure and line-data are
       written in binary format.  While the magic number used by the Unix
       systems can be seen using <a href="../man1/od.1.html">od(1)</a>, none of the Unix systems documents
       the format used for screen-dumps.

       The Unix systems do not use identical formats.  While collecting
       information for for this manual page, the <i>savescreen</i> test-program
       produced dumps of different size (all on 64-bit hardware, on 40x80
       screens):

       ·   AIX (51817 bytes)

       ·   HPUX (90093 bytes)

       ·   Solaris 10 (13273 bytes)

       ·   ncurses5 (12888 bytes)

   <b>Solaris</b>
       As noted above, Solaris curses has no magic number corresponding to
       SVr4 curses.  This is odd since Solaris was the first operating
       system to pass the SVr4 guidelines.  Solaris has two versions of
       curses:

       ·   The default curses library uses the SVr3 magic number.

       ·   There is an alternate curses library in <b>/usr/xpg4</b>.  This uses a
           textual format with no magic number.

           According to the copyright notice, the <i>xpg4</i> Solaris curses
           library was developed by MKS (Mortice Kern Systems) from 1990 to
           1995.

           Like ncurses6, there is a file-header with parameters.  Unlike
           ncurses6, the contents of the window are written piecemeal, with
           coordinates and attributes for each chunk of text rather than
           writing the whole window from top to bottom.

   <b>PDCurses</b>
       PDCurses added support for screen dumps in version 2.7 (2005).  Like
       Unix SystemV and ncurses5, it writes the <b>WINDOW </b>structure in binary,
       but begins the file with its three-byte identifier “PDC”, followed by
       a one-byte version, e.g.,

              “PDC\001”

   <b>NetBSD</b>
       As of April 2017, NetBSD curses does not support <b>scr_dump </b>and
       <b>scr_restore </b>(or <b>scr_init</b>, <b>scr_set</b>), although it has <b>putwin </b>and
       <b>getwin</b>.

       Like ncurses5, NetBSD <b>putwin </b>does not identify its dumps with a
       useful magic number.  It writes

       ·   the curses shared library major and minor versions as the first
           two bytes (e.g., 7 and 1),

       ·   followed by a binary dump of the <b>WINDOW</b>,

       ·   some data for wide-characters referenced by the <b>WINDOW </b>structure,
           and

       ·   finally, lines as done by other implementations.

       Given a simple program which writes text to the screen (and for the
       sake of example, limiting the screen-size to 10x20):

         #include &lt;curses.h&gt;

         int
         main(void)
         {
             putenv("LINES=10");
             putenv("COLUMNS=20");
             initscr();
             start_color();
             init_pair(1, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLUE);
             init_pair(2, COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK);
             bkgd(COLOR_PAIR(1));
             move(4, 5);
             attron(A_BOLD);
             addstr("Hello");
             move(5, 5);
             attroff(A_BOLD);
             attrset(A_REVERSE | COLOR_PAIR(2));
             addstr("World!");
             refresh();
             scr_dump("foo.out");
             endwin();
             return 0;
         }

       When run using ncurses6, the output looks like this:

         \210\210\210\210ncurses 6.0.20170415
         _cury=5

       The first four octal escapes are actually nonprinting characters,
       while the remainder of the file is printable text.  You may notice:

       ·   The actual color pair values are not written to the file.

       ·   All characters are shown in printable form; spaces are “\s” to
           ensure they are not overlooked.

       ·   Attributes are written in escaped curly braces, e.g., “\{BOLD}”,
           and may include a color-pair (C1 or C2 in this example).

       ·   The parameters in the header are written out only if they are
           nonzero.  When reading back, order does not matter.

       Running the same program with Solaris <i>xpg4</i> curses gives this dump:

       Solaris <b>getwin </b>requires that all parameters are present, and in the
       same order.  The <i>xpg4</i> curses library does not know about the <b>bce</b>
       (back color erase) capability, and does not color the window
       background.

       On the other hand, the SVr4 curses library does know about the
       background color.  However, its screen dumps are in binary.  Here is
       the corresponding dump (using “od -t x1”):
