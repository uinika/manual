       <i>mdadm</i> is a tool for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID devices
       using the <b>md </b>driver in Linux.

       Some common tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be simplified
       by describing the devices and arrays in this configuration file.

   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The file should be seen as a collection of words separated by white
       space (space, tab, or newline).  Any word that beings with a hash
       sign (#) starts a comment and that word together with the remainder
       of the line is ignored.

       Spaces can be included in a word using quotation characters.  Either
       single quotes (<b>'</b>) or double quotes (<b>"</b>) may be used.  All the
       characters from one quotation character to next identical character
       are protected and will not be used to separate words to start new
       quoted strings.  To include a single quote it must be between double
       quotes.  To include a double quote it must be between single quotes.

       Any line that starts with white space (space or tab) is treated as
       though it were a continuation of the previous line.

       Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continuation) line
       must start with a keyword as listed below.  The keywords are case
       insensitive and can be abbreviated to 3 characters.

       The keywords are:

       <b>DEVICE </b>A <b>device </b>line lists the devices (whole devices or partitions)
              that might contain a component of an MD array.  When looking
              for the components of an array, <i>mdadm</i> will scan these devices
              (or any devices listed on the command line).

              The <b>device </b>line may contain a number of different devices
              (separated by spaces) and each device name can contain wild
              cards as defined by <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a>.

              Also, there may be several device lines present in the file.

              Alternatively, a <b>device </b>line can contain either or both of the
              words <b>containers </b>and <b>partitions</b>.  The word <b>containers </b>will
              cause <i>mdadm</i> to look for assembled CONTAINER arrays and
              included them as a source for assembling further arrays.

              The word <i>partitions</i> will cause <i>mdadm</i> to read <i>/proc/partitions</i>
              and include all devices and partitions found therein.  <i>mdadm</i>
              does not use the names from <i>/proc/partitions</i> but only the
              major and minor device numbers.  It scans <i>/dev</i> to find the
              name that matches the numbers.

              If no DEVICE line is present, then "DEVICE partitions
              containers" is assumed.

              For example:

              DEVICE /dev/hda* /dev/hdc*
              DEV    /dev/sd*
              DEVICE /dev/disk/by-path/pci*
              DEVICE partitions

       <b>ARRAY  </b>The ARRAY lines identify actual arrays.  The second word on
              the line may be the name of the device where the array is
              normally assembled, such as <b>/dev/md1 </b>or <b>/dev/md/backup</b>.  If
              the name does not start with a slash ('<b>/</b>'), it is treated as
              being in <b>/dev/md/</b>.  Alternately the word <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>(complete
              with angle brackets) can be given in which case any array
              which matches the rest of the line will never be automatically
              assembled.  If no device name is given, <i>mdadm</i> will use various
              heuristics to determine an appropriate name.

              Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as
              a member of a group. If multiple identities are given, then a
              component device must match ALL identities to be considered a
              match.  Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and
              some value.  The tags are:

           <b>uuid=  </b>The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadecimal, with
                  punctuation interspersed if desired.  This must match the
                  uuid stored in the superblock.

           <b>name=  </b>The value should be a simple textual name as was given to
                  <i>mdadm</i> when the array was created.  This must match the
                  name stored in the superblock on a device for that device
                  to be included in the array.  Not all superblock formats
                  support names.

           <b>super-minor=</b>
                  The value is an integer which indicates the minor number
                  that was stored in the superblock when the array was
                  created. When an array is created as /dev/mdX, then the
                  minor number X is stored.

           <b>devices=</b>
                  The value is a comma separated list of device names or
                  device name patterns.  Only devices with names which match
                  one entry in the list will be used to assemble the array.
                  Note that the devices listed there must also be listed on
                  a DEVICE line.

           <b>level= </b>The value is a RAID level.  This is not normally used to
                  identify an array, but is supported so that the output of

                  <b>mdadm --examine --scan</b>

                  can be use directly in the configuration file.

           <b>num-devices=</b>
                  The value is the number of devices in a complete active
                  array.  As with <b>level= </b>this is mainly for compatibility
                  with the output of

                  <b>mdadm --examine --scan</b>.

           <b>spares=</b>
                  The value is a number of spare devices to expect the array
                  to have.  The sole use of this keyword and value is as
                  follows: <b>mdadm --monitor </b>will report an array if it is
                  found to have fewer than this number of spares when
                  <b>--monitor </b>starts or when <b>--oneshot </b>is used.

           <b>spare-group=</b>
                  The value is a textual name for a group of arrays.  All
                  arrays with the same <b>spare-group </b>name are considered to be
                  part of the same group.  The significance of a group of
                  arrays is that <i>mdadm</i> will, when monitoring the arrays,
                  move a spare drive from one array in a group to another
                  array in that group if the first array had a failed or
                  missing drive but no spare.

           <b>auto=  </b>This option is rarely needed with mdadm-3.0, particularly
                  if use with the Linux kernel v2.6.28 or later.  It tells
                  <i>mdadm</i> whether to use partitionable array or non-
                  partitionable arrays and, in the absence of <i>udev</i>, how many
                  partition devices to create.  From 2.6.28 all md array
                  devices are partitionable, hence this option is not
                  needed.

                  The value of this option can be "yes" or "md" to indicate
                  that a traditional, non-partitionable md array should be
                  created, or "mdp", "part" or "partition" to indicate that
                  a partitionable md array (only available in linux 2.6 and
                  later) should be used.  This later set can also have a
                  number appended to indicate how many partitions to create
                  device files for, e.g.  <b>auto=mdp5</b>.  The default is 4.

           <b>bitmap=</b>
                  The option specifies a file in which a write-intent bitmap
                  should be found.  When assembling the array, <i>mdadm</i> will
                  provide this file to the <b>md </b>driver as the bitmap file.
                  This has the same function as the <b>--bitmap-file </b>option to
                  <b>--assemble</b>.

           <b>metadata=</b>
                  Specify the metadata format that the array has.  This is
                  mainly recognised for comparability with the output of
                  <b>mdadm -Es</b>.

           <b>container=</b>
                  Specify that this array is a member array of some
                  container.  The value given can be either a path name in
                  /dev, or a UUID of the container array.

           <b>member=</b>
                  Specify that this array is a member array of some
                  container.  Each type of container has some way to
                  enumerate member arrays, often a simple sequence number.
                  The value identifies which member of a container the array
                  is.  It will usually accompany a "container=" word.

       <b>MAILADDR</b>
              The <b>mailaddr </b>line gives an E-mail address that alerts should
              be sent to when <i>mdadm</i> is running in <b>--monitor </b>mode (and was
              given the <b>--scan </b>option).  There should only be one <b>MAILADDR</b>
              line and it should have only one address.  Any subsequent
              addresses are silently ignored.

       <b>MAILFROM</b>
              The <b>mailfrom </b>line (which can only be abbreviated to at least 5
              characters) gives an address to appear in the "From" address
              for alert mails.  This can be useful if you want to explicitly
              set a domain, as the default from address is "root" with no
              domain.  All words on this line are catenated with spaces to
              form the address.

              Note that this value cannot be set via the <i>mdadm</i> commandline.
              It is only settable via the config file.

       <b>PROGRAM</b>
              The <b>program </b>line gives the name of a program to be run when
              <b>mdadm --monitor </b>detects potentially interesting events on any
              of the arrays that it is monitoring.  This program gets run
              with two or three arguments, they being the Event, the md
              device, and possibly the related component device.

              There should only be one <b>program </b>line and it should be give
              only one program.

       <b>CREATE </b>The <b>create </b>line gives default values to be used when creating
              arrays, new members of arrays, and device entries for arrays.
              These include:

           <b>owner=</b>

           <b>group= </b>These can give user/group ids or names to use instead of
                  system defaults (root/wheel or root/disk).

           <b>mode=  </b>An octal file mode such as 0660 can be given to override
                  the default of 0600.

           <b>auto=  </b>This corresponds to the <b>--auto </b>flag to mdadm.  Give <b>yes</b>,
                  <b>md</b>, <b>mdp</b>, <b>part </b>— possibly followed by a number of
                  partitions — to indicate how missing device entries should
                  be created.

           <b>metadata=</b>
                  The name of the metadata format to use if none is
                  explicitly given.  This can be useful to impose a system-
                  wide default of version-1 superblocks.

           <b>symlinks=no</b>
                  Normally when creating devices in <b>/dev/md/ </b><i>mdadm</i> will
                  create a matching symlink from <b>/dev/ </b>with a name starting
                  <b>md </b>or <b>md_</b>.  Give <b>symlinks=no </b>to suppress this symlink
                  creation.

           <b>names=yes</b>
                  Since Linux 2.6.29 it has been possible to create <b>md</b>
                  devices with a name like <b>md_home </b>rather than just a
                  number, like <b>md3</b>.  <i>mdadm</i> will use the numeric alternative
                  by default as other tools that interact with md arrays may
                  expect only numbers.  If <b>names=yes </b>is given in <i>mdadm.conf</i>
                  then <i>mdadm</i> will use a name when appropriate.  If <b>names=no</b>
                  is given, then non-numeric <i>md</i> device names will not be
                  used even if the default changes in a future release of
                  <i>mdadm</i>.

           <b>bbl=no </b>By default, <i>mdadm</i> will reserve space for a bad block list
                  (bbl) on all devices included in or added to any array
                  that supports them.  Setting <b>bbl=no </b>will prevent this, so
                  newly added devices will not have a bad block log.

       <b>HOMEHOST</b>
              The <b>homehost </b>line gives a default value for the <b>--homehost=</b>
              option to mdadm.  There should normally be only one other word
              on the line.  It should either be a host name, or one of the
              special words <b>&lt;system&gt;, &lt;none&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;ignore&gt;</b>.  If <b>&lt;system&gt; </b>is
              given, then the <b>gethostname</b>(<b>2</b>) systemcall is used to get the
              host name.  This is the default.

              If <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>is given, then a flag is set so that when arrays
              are being auto-assembled the checking of the recorded <i>homehost</i>
              is disabled.  If <b>&lt;ignore&gt; </b>is given it is also possible to give
              an explicit name which will be used when creating arrays.
              This is the only case when there can be more that one other
              word on the <b>HOMEHOST </b>line.  If there are other words, or other
              <b>HOMEHOST </b>lines, they are silently ignored.

              If <b>&lt;none&gt; </b>is given, then the default of using <b>gethostname</b>(<b>2</b>)
              is over-ridden and no homehost name is assumed.

              When arrays are created, this host name will be stored in the
              metadata.  When arrays are assembled using auto-assembly,
              arrays which do not record the correct homehost name in their
              metadata will be assembled using a "foreign" name.  A
              "foreign" name alway ends with a digit string preceded by an
              underscore to differentiate it from any possible local name.
              e.g.  <b>/dev/md/1_1 </b>or <b>/dev/md/home_0</b>.

       <b>AUTO   </b>A list of names of metadata format can be given, each preceded
              by a plus or minus sign.  Also the word <i>homehost</i> is allowed as
              is <i>all</i> preceded by plus or minus sign.  <i>all</i> is usually last.

              When <i>mdadm</i> is auto-assembling an array, either via <i>--assemble</i>
              or <i>--incremental</i> and it finds metadata of a given type, it
              checks that metadata type against those listed in this line.
              The first match wins, where <i>all</i> matches anything.  If a match
              is found that was preceded by a plus sign, the auto assembly
              is allowed.  If the match was preceded by a minus sign, the
              auto assembly is disallowed.  If no match is found, the auto
              assembly is allowed.

              If the metadata indicates that the array was created for <i>this</i>
              host, and the word <i>homehost</i> appears before any other match,
              then the array is treated as a valid candidate for auto-
              assembly.

              This can be used to disable all auto-assembly (so that only
              arrays explicitly listed in mdadm.conf or on the command line
              are assembled), or to disable assembly of certain metadata
              types which might be handled by other software.  It can also
              be used to disable assembly of all foreign arrays - normally
              such arrays are assembled but given a non-deterministic name
              in <b>/dev/md/</b>.

              The known metadata types are <b>0.90</b>, <b>1.x</b>, <b>ddf</b>, <b>imsm</b>.

              <b>AUTO </b>should be given at most once.  Subsequent lines are
              silently ignored.  Thus an earlier config file in a config
              directory will over-ride the setting in a later config file.

       <b>POLICY </b>This is used to specify what automatic behavior is allowed on
              devices newly appearing in the system and provides a way of
              marking spares that can be moved to other arrays as well as
              the migration domains.  <i>Domain</i> can be defined through <i>policy</i>
              line by specifying a domain name for a number of paths from
              <b>/dev/disk/by-path/</b>.  A device may belong to several domains.
              The domain of an array is a union of domains of all devices in
              that array.  A spare can be automatically moved from one array
              to another if the set of the destination array's <i>domains</i>
              contains all the <i>domains</i> of the new disk or if both arrays
              have the same <i>spare-group</i>.

              To update hot plug configuration it is necessary to execute
              <b>mdadm --udev-rules </b>command after changing the config file

              Key words used in the <i>POLICY</i> line and supported values are:

              <b>domain=</b>
                     any arbitrary string

              <b>metadata=</b>
                     0.9 1.x ddf or imsm

              <b>path=  </b>file glob matching anything from <b>/dev/disk/by-path</b>

              <b>type=  </b>either <b>disk </b>or <b>part</b>.

              <b>action=</b>
                     include, re-add, spare, spare-same-slot, or force-spare

              <b>auto=  </b>yes, no, or homehost.

              The <i>action</i> item determines the automatic behavior allowed for
              devices matching the <i>path</i> and <i>type</i> in the same line.  If a
              device matches several lines with different <i>actions</i> then the
              most permissive will apply. The ordering of policy lines is
              irrelevant to the end result.

              <b>include</b>
                     allows adding a disk to an array if metadata on that
                     disk matches that array

              <b>re-add </b>will include the device in the array if it appears to
                     be a current member or a member that was recently
                     removed and the array has a write-intent-bitmap to
                     allow the <b>re-add </b>functionality.

              <b>spare  </b>as above and additionally: if the device is bare it can
                     become a spare if there is any array that it is a
                     candidate for based on domains and metadata.

              <b>spare-same-slot</b>
                     as above and additionally if given slot was used by an
                     array that went degraded recently and the device
                     plugged in has no metadata then it will be
                     automatically added to that array (or it's container)

              <b>force-spare</b>
                     as above and the disk will become a spare in remaining
                     cases
